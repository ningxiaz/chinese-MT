A01 0010    The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation
A01 0020 of Atlanta's recent primary election produced "no evidence" that
A01 0030 any irregularities took place.   The jury further said in term-end
A01 0040 presentments that the City Executive Committee, which had over-all
A01 0050 charge of the election, "deserves the praise and thanks of the
A01 0060 City of Atlanta" for the manner in which the election was conducted.
A01 0070    The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton
A01 0080 Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible
A01 0090 "irregularities" in the hard-fought primary which was won by
A01 0100 Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr&.   "Only a relative handful
A01 0110 of such reports was received", the jury said, "considering the
A01 0120 widespread interest in the election, the number of voters and the size
A01 0130 of this city".   The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's
A01 0140 registration and election laws "are outmoded or inadequate
A01 0150 and often ambiguous".   It recommended that Fulton legislators
A01 0160 act "to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing
A01 0170 and improving them".   The grand jury commented on a number
A01 0180 of other topics, among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing
A01 0190 departments which it said "are well operated and follow generally
A01 0200 accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments".
A01 0210 #MERGER PROPOSED# However, the jury said it believes "these
A01 0220 two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce
A01 0230 the cost of administration".   The City Purchasing Department,
A01 0240 the jury said, "is lacking in experienced clerical personnel
A01 0250 as a result of city personnel policies". It urged that the city "take
A01 0260 steps to remedy" this problem.   Implementation of Georgia's
A01 0270 automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury.
A01 0280    It urged that the next Legislature "provide enabling funds
A01 0290 and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of
A01 0300 the law may be effected".   The grand jury took a swipe at the
A01 0310 State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for
A01 0320 child welfare services in foster homes.   "This is one of the
A01 0330 major items in the Fulton County general assistance program", the
A01 0340 jury said, but the State Welfare Department "has seen fit to distribute
A01 0350 these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties
A01 0360 in the state with the exception of Fulton County, which receives
A01 0370 none of this money.   The jurors said they realize "a proportionate
A01 0380 distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less
A01 0390 populous counties".   Nevertheless, "we feel that in the
A01 0400 future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available
A01 0410 funds", the jurors said. "Failure to do this will continue to place
A01 0420 a disproportionate burden" on Fulton taxpayers.   The jury
A01 0430 also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under
A01 0440 fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers, guardians and
A01 0450 administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation. #WARDS PROTECTED#
A01 0460 The jury said it found the court "has incorporated into
A01 0470 its operating procedures the recommendations" of two previous grand
A01 0480 juries, the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee.
A01 0490    "These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect
A01 0500 the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected
A01 0510 servants from unmeritorious criticisms", the jury said.   Regarding
A01 0520 Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport, the jury recommended
A01 0530 "that when the new management takes charge Jan& 1 the airport
A01 0540 be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences".
A01 0550    The jury did not elaborate, but it added that "there should
A01 0560 be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires
A01 0570 for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable". #ASK JAIL
A01 0580 DEPUTIES# On other matters, the jury recommended that: _(1)_
A01 0590 Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and
A01 0600 "a doctor, medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend
A01 0610 duty at the jail". _(2)_ Fulton legislators "work with city
A01 0620 officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment
A01 0630 of a fair and equitable" pension plan for city employes.
A01 0640    The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta
A01 0650 Police Department, the Fulton Tax Commissioner's Office, the Bellwood
A01 0660 and Alpharetta prison farms, Grady Hospital and the Fulton
A01 0670 Health Department.
A01 0680    Mayor William B& Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his
A01 0690 wife,
A01 0695 Pearl Williams Hartsfield, in Fulton Superior Court Friday.
A01 0700 His petition charged mental cruelty.   The couple was married
A01 0710 Aug& 2, 1913. They have a son, William Berry Jr&, and a daughter,
A01 0720 Mrs& J& M& Cheshire of Griffin.   Attorneys
A01 0730 for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed
A01 0740 upon.   The petition listed the mayor's occupation as "attorney"
A01 0750 and his age as 71. It listed his wife's age as 74 and place
A01 0760 of birth as Opelika, Ala&.   The petition said that the couple
A01 0770 has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year.
A01 0780    The Hartsfield home is at 637 E& Pelham Rd& ~NE.
A01 0790    Henry L& Bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor's attorney.
A01 0800    Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta, with exception
A01 0810 of one brief interlude, since 1937. His political career goes back to
A01 0820 his election to city council in 1923.   The mayor's present
A01 0830 term of office expires Jan& 1. He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen
A01 0840 Jr&, who became a candidate in the Sept& 13 primary after Mayor
A01 0850 Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection.
A01 0860    Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter
A01 0870 a candidate in the 1962 governor's race, a top official said Wednesday.
A01 0880    Robert Snodgrass, state ~GOP chairman, said a meeting
A01 0890 held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses
A01 0900 from the audience.   State Party Chairman James W& Dorsey
A01 0910 added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept&
A01 0920 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen& John Tower
A01 0930 will be the featured speaker.   In the Blue Ridge meeting,
A01 0940 the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force
A01 0950 it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures
A01 0960 of registered voters.   Despite the warning, there was a
A01 0970 unanimous vote to enter a candidate, according to Republicans who attended.
A01 0980    When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one
A01 0990 more term to make the race, it voted no- and there were no dissents.
A01 1000    The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a
A01 1010 state law which says that before making a first race, one of two alternative
A01 1020 courses must be taken: _1._ Five per cent of the voters
A01 1030 in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be
A01 1040 allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot,
A01 1050 or _2._ The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit
A01 1060 system- a system which the party opposes in its platform.
A01 1070    Sam Caldwell, State Highway Department public relations director,
A01 1080 resigned Tuesday to work for Lt& Gov& Garland Byrd's
A01 1090 campaign.   Caldwell's resignation had been expected for some
A01 1100 time. He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville, who has
A01 1110 been an assistant more than three years. When the gubernatorial campaign
A01 1120 starts, Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for
A01 1130 Byrd.
A01 1140    The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday
A01 1150 and head for home- where some of the highway bond money it approved
A01 1160 will follow shortly.   Before adjournment Monday afternoon, the
A01 1170 Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators
A01 1180 allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should
A01 1190 be made.   Gov& Vandiver is expected to make the traditional
A01 1200 visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment. Vandiver likely
A01 1210 will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier
A01 1220 in the session as his first priority item. #CONSTRUCTION BONDS# Meanwhile,
A01 1230 it was learned the State Highway Department is very near
A01 1240 being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction
A01 1250 bonds.   The bond issue will go to the state courts for a
A01 1260 friendly test suit to test the validity of the act, and then the sales
A01 1270 will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's
A01 1280 most heavily traveled highways.   A Highway Department source
A01 1290 said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million
A01 1300 worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work.
A01 1310 #A REVOLVING FUND# The department apparently intends to make
A01 1320 the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would
A01 1330 be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax
A01 1340 authorities.   Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with
A01 1350 a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth
A01 1360 of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov& Marvin
A01 1370 Griffin.   The Highway Department source told The Constitution,
A01 1380 however, that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans
A01 1390 to issue the new rural roads bonds.
A01 1400    Schley County Rep& B& D& Pelham will offer a resolution
A01 1410 Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in
A01 1420 voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances.   Pelham
A01 1430 said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the
A01 1440 "quickie" vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether
A01 1450 notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action
A01 1460 would be sought.   While emphasizing that technical details were
A01 1470 not fully worked out, Pelham said his resolution would seek to set
A01 1480 aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31.
A01 1490    A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29-5.
A01 1500 As of Sunday night, there was no word of a resolution being offered
A01 1510 there to rescind the action.   Pelham pointed out that Georgia
A01 1520 voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators
A01 1530 to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions.
A01 1540    A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House
A01 1550 Monday to back federal aid to education, something it has consistently
A01 1560 opposed in the past.   Rep& Mac Barber of Commerce is
A01 1570 asking the House in a privilege resolution to "endorse increased federal
A01 1580 support for public education, provided that such funds be received
A01 1590 and expended" as state funds.   Barber, who is in his 13th
A01 1600 year as a legislator, said there "are some members of our congressional
A01 1610 delegation in Washington who would like to see it (the resolution)
A01 1620 passed". But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically
A01 1630 asked him to offer the resolution.   The resolution, which
A01 1640 Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday, will be formally read
A01 1645 Monday. It says that "in
A01 1650 the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds", the
A01 1660 State Board of Education should be directed to "give priority"
A01 1670 to teacher pay raises. _COLQUITT_- After a long, hot controversy,
A01 1680 Miller County has a new school superintendent, elected, as a
A01 1690 policeman put it, in the "coolest election I ever saw in this county".
A01 1700    The new school superintendent is Harry Davis, a veteran
A01 1710 agriculture teacher, who defeated Felix Bush, a school principal and
A01 1720 chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee.
A01 1730    Davis received 1,119 votes in Saturday's election, and Bush
A01 1740 got 402. Ordinary Carey Williams, armed with a pistol, stood by at
A01 1750 the polls to insure order.   "This was the coolest, calmest
A01 1760 election I ever saw", Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said. "Being
A01 1770 at the polls was just like being at church. I didn't smell
A01 1780 a drop of liquor, and we didn't have a bit of trouble".   The
A01 1790 campaign leading to the election was not so quiet, however. It was
A01 1800 marked by controversy, anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats
A01 1810 of violence.   The former county school superintendent, George
A01 1820 P& Callan, shot himself to death March 18, four days after he
A01 1830 resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board.   During
A01 1840 the election campaign, both candidates, Davis and Bush, reportedly
A01 1850 received anonymous telephone calls. Ordinary Williams said he,
A01 1860 too, was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election.
A01 1870    Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities
A01 1880 at the polls, and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun
A01 1890 and promised an orderly election.   Sheriff Felix Tabb said the
A01 1900 ordinary apparently made good his promise.   "Everything went
A01 1910 real smooth", the sheriff said. "There wasn't a bit of trouble".
A02 0010 _AUSTIN, TEXAS_- Committee approval of Gov& Price Daniel's
A02 0020 "abandoned property" act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant
A02 0030 protests of Texas bankers.   Daniel personally led the fight
A02 0040 for the measure, which he had watered down considerably since its
A02 0050 rejection by two previous Legislatures, in a public hearing before
A02 0060 the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation.   Under committee
A02 0070 rules, it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week. But
A02 0080 questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses
A02 0090 left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it.
A02 0100    Daniel termed "extremely conservative" his estimate that it would
A02 0110 produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of
A02 0120 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug&
A02 0130 31.   He told the committee the measure would merely provide means
A02 0140 of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books "since
A02 0150 Texas was a republic". It permits the state to take over bank accounts,
A02 0160 stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven
A02 0170 years or more.   The bill, which Daniel said he drafted personally,
A02 0180 would force banks, insurance firms, pipeline companies and other
A02 0190 corporations to report such property to the state treasurer. The escheat
A02 0200 law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate
A02 0210 such property, Daniel declared.   Dewey Lawrence, a Tyler
A02 0220 lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association, sounded the opposition
A02 0230 keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual
A02 0240 obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank
A02 0250 customers.   "If you destroy confidence in banks, you do something
A02 0260 to the economy", he said. "You take out of circulation many
A02 0270 millions of dollars".   Rep& Charles E& Hughes of Sherman,
A02 0280 sponsor of the bill, said a failure to enact it would amount "to
A02 0290 making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks, insurance
A02 0300 and pipeline companies".   His contention was denied by several
A02 0310 bankers, including Scott Hudson of Sherman, Gaynor B& Jones
A02 0320 of Houston, J& B& Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin.
A02 0330    Cox argued that the bill is "probably unconstitutional"
A02 0340 since, he said, it would impair contracts.   He also complained
A02 0350 that not enough notice was given on the hearing, since the bill was
A02 0360 introduced only last Monday.
A02 0370 _AUSTIN, TEXAS_- Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill
A02 0380 of Sen& George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment
A02 0390 of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties.
A02 0400    The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more
A02 0410 deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state.
A02 0420    There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the
A02 0430 House.   It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish
A02 0440 county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or
A02 0450 more population, require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age
A02 0460 to attend the day schools, permitting older ones to attend the residential
A02 0470 Texas School for the Deaf here.   Operating budget for the
A02 0480 day schools in the five counties of Dallas, Harris, Bexar, Tarrant
A02 0490 and El Paso would be $451,500, which would be a savings of $157,460
A02 0500 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed,
A02 0510 Parkhouse told the Senate.   The ~TEA estimated there
A02 0520 would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County,
A02 0530 saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school.
A02 0540 #@# {DALLAS MAY GET} to hear a debate on horse race
A02 0545 parimutuels
A02 0550 soon between Reps& V& E& (Red) Berry and Joe Ratcliff.
A02 0560    While details are still be to worked out, Ratcliff said
A02 0570 he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry's proposed
A02 0580 constitutional amendment should be rejected.   "We're
A02 0590 getting more 'pro' letters than 'con' on horse race betting",
A02 0600 said Ratcliff. "But I believe if people were better informed on
A02 0610 this question, most of them would oppose it also. I'm willing to stake
A02 0620 my political career on it".   Rep& Berry, an ex-gambler
A02 0630 from San Antonio, got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies.
A02 0640 A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected
A02 0650 to give it a favorable report, although the resolution faces hard
A02 0660 sledding later. #@# {THE HOUSE} passed finally, and
A02 0665 sent
A02 0670 to the Senate, a bill extending the State Health Department's
A02 0680 authority to give planning assistance to cities. #@# {THE
A02 0685 SENATE}
A02 0690 quickly whipped through its meager fare of House bills approved
A02 0700 by committees, passing the three on the calendar. One validated acts
A02 0710 of school districts. Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont
A02 0720 Navigation District.   The third amended the enabling act for
A02 0730 creation of the Lamar county Hospital District, for which a special
A02 0740 constitutional amendment previously was adopted. #@# {WITHOUT
A02 0745 DISSENT},
A02 0750 senators passed a bill by Sen& A& R& Schwartz
A02 0760 of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for
A02 0770 the mentally retarded in the Gulf Coast district. Money for its construction
A02 0780 will be sought later on but in the meantime the State Hospital
A02 0790 board can accept gifts and donations of a site. #@# {TWO
A02 0795 TAX REVISION}
A02 0800 bills were passed. One, by Sen& Louis Crump of
A02 0810 San Saba, would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of
A02 0820 miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return
A02 0830 be notarized. Instead, retailers would sign a certificate of correctness,
A02 0840 violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years
A02 0850 in prison, plus a $1,000 fine. It was one of a series of recommendations
A02 0860 by the Texas Research League. #@# {THE OTHER BILL},
A02 0870 by Sen& A& M& Aikin Jr& of Paris, would relieve real
A02 0880 estate brokers, who pay their own annual licensing fee, from the $12 annual
A02 0890 occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds. #@#
A02 0895 {NATURAL GAS}
A02 0900 public utility companies would be given the right
A02 0910 of eminent domain, under a bill by Sen& Frank Owen /3, of
A02 0920 El Paso, to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas.
A02 0930 #@# {MARSHALL FORMBY} of Plainview, former chairman
A02 0935 of
A02 0940 the Texas Highway Commission, suggested a plan to fill by appointment
A02 0950 future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress, eliminating the
A02 0960 need for costly special elections.   Under Formby's plan, an
A02 0970 appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor, lieutenant
A02 0980 governor, speaker of the House, attorney general and chief justice
A02 0990 of the Texas Supreme Court.
A02 1000 _AUSTIN, TEXAS_- State representatives decided Thursday against
A02 1010 taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay.
A02 1020    An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee
A02 1030 a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot, when
A02 1040 Texas votes on a U&S& senator.   Rep& Wesley Roberts
A02 1050 of Seminole, sponsor of the poll idea, said that further delay in the
A02 1060 committee can kill the bill.   The West Texan reported that
A02 1070 he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set
A02 1080 it for public hearing on Feb& 22. The proposal would have to receive
A02 1090 final legislative approval, by two-thirds majorities, before March
A02 1100 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot, Roberts said.   Opponents
A02 1110 generally argued that the ballot couldn't give enough information
A02 1120 about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice.
A02 1130    All Dallas members voted with Roberts, except Rep& Bill
A02 1140 Jones, who was absent.
A02 1150 _AUSTIN, TEXAS_- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas'
A02 1160 big cities Thursday.   Rep& James Cotten of Weatherford
A02 1170 insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House
A02 1180 of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort
A02 1190 Worth to cover up places like Paradise, a Wise County hamlet
A02 1200 of 250 people.   When the shouting ended, the bill passed, 114
A02 1210 to 4, sending it to the Senate, where a similar proposal is being sponsored
A02 1220 by Sen& George Parkhouse of Dallas.   Most of the fire
A02 1230 was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen& Parkhouse. The
A02 1240 bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan
A02 1250 the state could make to a local water project.   Cotten construed
A02 1260 this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large
A02 1270 cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing
A02 1280 water for rural Texas.   Statements by other legislators that
A02 1290 Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds, and that less
A02 1300 populous places would benefit most by the pending bill, did not sway
A02 1310 Cotten's attack.   The bill's defenders were mostly small-town
A02 1320 legislators like J& W& Buchanan of Dumas, Eligio (Kika)
A02 1330 de la Garza of Mission, Sam F& Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman
A02 1340 of Sulphur Springs.   "This is a poor boy's bill",
A02 1350 said Chapman. "Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds. This would
A02 1360 help the little peanut districts".
A02 1370 _AUSTIN, TEXAS_- A Houston teacher, now serving in the Legislature,
A02 1380 proposed Thursday a law reducing the time spent learning "educational
A02 1390 methods".   Rep& Henry C& Grover, who teaches
A02 1400 history in the Houston public schools, would reduce from 24 to 12 semester
A02 1410 hours the so-called "teaching methods" courses required to
A02 1420 obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate. A normal
A02 1430 year's work in college is 30 semester hours.   Grover also would
A02 1440 require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours
A02 1450 credit in the subject they are teaching. The remainder of the 4-year
A02 1460 college requirement would be in general subjects.   "A person
A02 1470 with a master's degree in physics, chemistry, math or English,
A02 1480 yet who has not taken Education courses, is not permitted to teach in
A02 1490 the public schools", said Grover.   College teachers in Texas
A02 1500 are not required to have the Education courses.   Fifty-three
A02 1510 of the 150 representatives immediately joined Grover as co-signers
A02 1520 of the proposal.
A02 1530 _PARIS, TEXAS (SP&)_- The board of regents of Paris Junior
A02 1540 College has named Dr& Clarence Charles Clark of Hays, Kan&
A02 1550 as the school's new president.   Dr& Clark will succeed Dr&
A02 1560 J& R& McLemore, who will retire at the close of the present
A02 1570 school term.   Dr& Clark holds an earned Doctor of Education
A02 1580 degree from the University of Oklahoma. He also received a Master
A02 1590 of Science degree from Texas ~A+~I College and a Bachelor
A02 1600 of Science degree from Southwestern State College, Weatherford,
A02 1610 Okla&.   In addition, Dr& Clark has studied at Rhode Island
A02 1620 State College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
A02 1630    During his college career, Dr& Clark was captain of his basketball
A02 1640 team and was a football letterman.   Dr& Clark has served
A02 1650 as teacher and principal in Oklahoma high schools, as teacher and
A02 1660 athletic director at Raymondville, Texas, High School, as an instructor
A02 1670 at the University of Oklahoma, and as an associate professor
A02 1680 of education at Fort Hays, Kan&, State College. He has served
A02 1690 as a border patrolman and was in the Signal Corps of the U&S&
A02 1700 Army.
A02 1710 _DENTON, TEXAS (SP&)_- Principals of the 13 schools in the Denton
A02 1720 Independent School District have been re-elected for the 1961-62
A02 1730 session upon the recommendation of Supt& Chester O& Strickland.
A02 1750    State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in
A02 1760 employment was called for yesterday in a report of a "blue ribbon"
A02 1770 citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program.
A02 1780 The report, culminating a year long study of the ~ADC program in
A02 1790 Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm, listed 10
A02 1800 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ~ADC
A02 1810 case load. The report called racial discrimination in employment "one
A02 1820 of the most serious causes of family breakdown, desertion, and ~ADC
A02 1830 dependency". #"MUST SOLVE PROBLEM"# The monthly cost
A02 1840 of ~ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million
A02 1850 dollars, said C& Virgil Martin, president of Carson Pirie
A02 1860 Scott + Co&, committee chairman.   "We must solve the problems
A02 1870 which have forced these people to depend upon ~ADC for subsistence",
A02 1880 Martin said.   The volume of ~ADC cases will decrease,
A02 1890 Martin reported, when the community is able to deal effectively
A02 1900 with two problems: Relatively limited skills and discrimination
A02 1910 in employment because of color. These, he said, are "two of the principal
A02 1920 underlying causes for family breakups leading to ~ADC".
A02 1930 #CALLS FOR EXTENSION# Other recommendations made by the committee
A02 1940 are:   Extension of the ~ADC program to all children in
A02 1950 need living with any relatives, including both parents, as a means of
A02 1960 preserving family unity.   Research projects as soon as possible
A02 1970 on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy.
A03 0010    Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made
A03 0020 statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest, Judge
A03 0030 James B& Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday.
A03 0040 The disclosure by Charles Bellows, chief defense counsel, startled
A03 0050 observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six
A03 0060 attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial.
A03 0070    Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant
A03 0080 his client, Alan Clements, 30, a separate trial. Bellows made the request
A03 0090 while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom. #FEARS PREJUDICIAL
A03 0100 ASPECTS# "The statements may be highly prejudicial to my
A03 0110 client", Bellows told the court. "Some of the defendants strongly
A03 0120 indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property. It is impossible
A03 0130 to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements
A03 0140 involving themselves and others".   Judge Parsons leaned over
A03 0150 the bench and inquired, "You mean some of the defendants made statements
A03 0160 admitting this"?   "Yes, your honor", replied
A03 0170 Bellows. "What this amounts to, if true, is that there will be a free-for-all
A03 0180 fight in this case. There is a conflict among the defendants".
A03 0200 _WASHINGTON, JULY 24_- President Kennedy today pushed aside other
A03 0210 White House business to devote all his time and attention to working
A03 0220 on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the
A03 0230 American people over nationwide television and radio.   The
A03 0240 President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape Cod
A03 0250 writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of
A03 0260 White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone.
A03 0270    Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning
A03 0280 from Hyannis Port, Mass&, a White House spokesman said
A03 0290 the address text still had "quite a way to go" toward completion.
A03 0300 #DECISIONS ARE MADE# Asked to elaborate, Pierre Salinger, White
A03 0310 House press secretary, replied, "I would say it's got to go
A03 0320 thru several more drafts".   Salinger said the work President
A03 0330 Kennedy, advisers, and members of his staff were doing on the address
A03 0340 involved composition and wording, rather than last minute decisions
A03 0350 on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated
A03 0360 by Russia's demands and proposals for the city.
A03 0370    The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov& 8 election
A03 0380 were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M& Karns, who
A03 0390 charged that the prosecution obtained evidence "by unfair and fundamentally
A03 0400 illegal means".   Karns said that the cases involved a
A03 0410 matter "of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence"
A03 0420 of the 50 persons. He said evidence was obtained "in violation of
A03 0430 the legal rights of citizens".   Karns' ruling pertained to
A03 0440 eight of the 10 cases. In the two other cases he ruled that the state
A03 0450 had been "unable to make a case". Contempt proceedings originally
A03 0460 had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J&
A03 0470 Wexler, special prosecutor. #ISSUE JURY SUBPENAS# Wexler
A03 0480 admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas
A03 0490 to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation, questioned
A03 0500 the individuals in the Criminal courts building, but did not take them
A03 0510 before the grand jury.   Mayer Goldberg, attorney for election
A03 0520 judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward, argued this procedure
A03 0530 constituted intimidation. Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion
A03 0540 was used in questioning.   Karns said it was a "wrongful act"
A03 0550 for Wexler to take statements "privately and outside of the grand
A03 0560 jury room". He said this constituted a "very serious misuse"
A03 0570 of the Criminal court processes.   "Actually, the abuse of the
A03 0580 process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook
A03 0590 county, altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the
A03 0600 function of this court", said Karns, who is a City judge in East
A03 0610 St& Louis sitting in Cook County court. #FACED SEVEN CASES#
A03 0620 Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35
A03 0630 persons. Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with
A03 0640 "complementary" miscount of the vote, in which votes would be taken
A03 0650 from one candidate and given to another.   The cases involved
A03 0660 judges in the 33d, 24th, and 42d precincts of the 31st ward, the 21st
A03 0670 and 28th precincts of the 29th ward, the 18th precinct of the 4th ward,
A03 0680 and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward.   The case of the judges
A03 0690 in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken
A03 0700 under advisement by Karns. Two other cases also were under advisement.
A03 0710 #CLAIMS PRECEDENT LACKING# After reading his statement discharging
A03 0720 the 23d ward case, Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases
A03 0730 scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed, he
A03 0740 would dismiss them.
A03 0750 _WASHINGTON, FEB& 9_- President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth
A03 0760 new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million
A03 0770 American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other
A03 0780 medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by
A03 0790 social security or railroad retirement programs.   The President,
A03 0800 in a special message to Congress, tied in with his aged care plan
A03 0810 requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships,
A03 0820 build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools, and expand child
A03 0830 health care and general medical research.   The aged care plan,
A03 0840 similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator, a
A03 0850 fight on Capitol hill. It was defeated in Congress last year. #COST
A03 0860 UP TO $37 A YEAR# It would be financed by boosting the social security
A03 0870 payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now
A03 0880 paying such taxes.   The social security payroll tax is now 6
A03 0890 per cent- 3 per cent on each worker and employer- on the first $4,800
A03 0900 of pay per year. The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to
A03 0910 $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent- 3.25 per cent each.
A03 0920 Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad
A03 0930 retirement system.   The payroll tax would actually rise
A03 0940 to 7.5 per cent starting Jan& 1, 1963, if the plan is approved, because
A03 0950 the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date
A03 0960 to pay for other social security costs. #OUTLAYS WOULD INCREASE#
A03 0970 Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would
A03 0980 amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would
A03 0990 run 1 billion or more in the first year, 1963. Both figures would go
A03 1000 higher in later years.   Other parts of the Kennedy health plan
A03 1010 would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over
A03 1020 the next 10 years. These would be paid for out of general, not payroll,
A03 1030 taxes. #NURSING HOME CARE# The aged care plan carries these
A03 1040 benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad
A03 1050 retirement systems: _1._ Full payment of hospital bills for
A03 1060 stays up to 90 days for each illness, except that the patient would
A03 1070 pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days. _2._ Full payment
A03 1080 of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from
A03 1090 a hospital. A patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing
A03 1100 home care under a "unit formula" allowing more of such care for those
A03 1110 who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit. _3._ Hospital
A03 1120 outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess
A03 1130 of $20 a patient. _4._ Community visiting nurse services at home
A03 1140 for up to 240 days an illness.   The President noted that Congress
A03 1150 last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical
A03 1160 bills of the needy aged. #CALLS PROPOSAL MODEST# He said his
A03 1170 plan is designed to "meet the needs of those millions who have no wish
A03 1180 to receive care at the taxpayers' expense, but who are nevertheless
A03 1190 staggered by the drain on their savings- or those of their children-
A03 1200 caused by an extended hospital stay".   "This is a very
A03 1210 modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs", he said,
A03 1220 "and with sufficient 'deductible' requirements to discourage any
A03 1230 malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals.   "This
A03 1240 is not a program of socialized medicine. It is a program of prepayment
A03 1250 of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed. Every
A03 1260 person will choose his own doctor and hospital". #WOULDN'T
A03 1270 PAY DOCTORS# The plan does not cover doctor bills. They would still
A03 1280 be paid by the patient.   Apart from the aged care plan the President's
A03 1290 most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships,
A03 1300 and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools.
A03 1310    The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools
A03 1320 cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need
A03 1330 for health care. Moreover, he said, many qualified young people are
A03 1340 not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the
A03 1350 schooling costs. #CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCHOOLS# The scholarship plan
A03 1355 would
A03 1360 provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal
A03 1370 to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students. The
A03 1380 schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships, based on need,
A03 1390 of up to $2,000 a year per student.   In addition, the government
A03 1400 would pay a $1,000 "cost of education" grant to the schools for
A03 1410 each $1,500 in scholarship grants. Officials estimated the combined
A03 1420 programs would cost
A03 1430 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21
A03 1440 millions by 1966.   The President recommended federal "matching
A03 1450 grants" totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing
A03 1460 new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing
A03 1470 ones. #MORE FOR NURSING HOMES# In the area of "community health
A03 1480 services", the President called for doubling the present 10 million
A03 1490 dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction. He asked
A03 1500 for another 10 million dollar "initial" appropriation for "stimulatory
A03 1510 grants" to states to improve nursing homes.   He further
A03 1520 proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals.
A03 1530    In the child health field, the President said he will recommend
A03 1540 later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau.
A03 1550 He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national
A03 1560 child health institute. #ASKS RESEARCH FUNDS# The President said
A03 1570 he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation.
A03 1580 He did not say by how much.   For medical research
A03 1590 he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase, from 30 to 50 millions,
A03 1600 in matching grants for building research facilities. The President
A03 1610 said he will also propose increasing, by an unspecified amount, the 540
A03 1620 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research
A03 1630 in medicine.   The President said his proposals combine the "indispensable
A03 1640 elements in a sound health program- people, knowledge,
A03 1650 services, facilities, and the means to pay for them". #REACTION
A03 1660 AS EXPECTED# Congressional reaction to the message was along expected
A03 1670 lines. Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under
A03 1680 the social security system criticized the President's plan. Those
A03 1690 who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message.   Senate
A03 1700 Republican Leader Dirksen [Ill&] and House Republican Leader
A03 1710 Charles Halleck [Ind&] said the message did not persuade them
A03 1720 to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance. Halleck
A03 1730 said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair
A03 1740 trial first.   House Speaker Sam Rayburn [D&, Tex&]
A03 1750 called the Kennedy program "a mighty fine thing", but made no prediction
A03 1760 on its fate in the House.
A03 1770 _WASHINGTON, FEB& 9_- Acting hastily under White House pressure,
A03 1780 the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C& Weaver as the nation's
A03 1790 federal housing chief.   Only 11 senators were on the floor
A03 1800 and there was no record vote. A number of scattered "ayes" and
A03 1810 "noes" was heard.   Customary Senate rules were ignored in
A03 1820 order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing
A03 1830 and home finance agency.   In the last eight years, all
A03 1840 Presidential appointments, including those of cabinet rank, have been
A03 1850 denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least
A03 1860 a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor. #ENFORCE BY DEMAND#
A03 1870 The rule was enforced by demand of Sen& Wayne Morse [D&,
A03 1880 Ore&] in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet
A03 1890 selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961.
A04 0010 _OSLO_ The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting
A04 0020 of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been
A04 0030 the freer, franker, and wider discussions, animated by much better mutual
A04 0040 understanding than in past meetings.   This has been a working
A04 0050 session of an organization that, by its very nature, can only proceed
A04 0060 along its route step by step and without dramatic changes. In Oslo,
A04 0070 the ministers have met in a climate of candor, and made a genuine
A04 0080 attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems.
A04 0090    This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable
A04 0100 where relations are concerned between the "colonialist" powers
A04 0110 and those who have never, or not for a long time, had such problems.
A04 0120 The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa, exacerbated
A04 0130 by the difficulties, changes, and tragedies facing them, and other
A04 0140 allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances
A04 0150 that have brought these troubles about, has been conspicious by
A04 0160 its absence. #EXPLOSION AVOIDED# In the case of Portugal, which
A04 0170 a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the ~NATO Council
A04 0180 should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh, there has been
A04 0190 a noticeable relaxation of tension. The general, remarkably courteous,
A04 0200 explanation has left basic positions unchanged, but there has been
A04 0210 no explosion in the council. There should even be no more bitter surprises
A04 0220 in the ~UN General Assembly as to ~NATO members' votes,
A04 0230 since a new ad hoc ~NATO committee has been set up so that
A04 0240 in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance.
A04 0250    Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt
A04 0260 to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the ~NATO
A04 0270 locomotive. Even Norway, despite daily but limited manifestations against
A04 0280 atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance,
A04 0290 is today closer to the ~NATO line.   On the negative
A04 0300 side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the
A04 0310 United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for.
A04 0320 One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's
A04 0330 speeches as "inconclusive". But he hastened to add that,
A04 0340 if United States policies were not always clear, despite Mr& Rusk's
A04 0350 analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the
A04 0360 West, this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly
A04 0370 fixed its policy. #EXPLORATORY MOOD# A certain vagueness may also
A04 0380 be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council
A04 0390 meeting is a semipublic affair, with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents
A04 0400 accredited.   The impression has nevertheless been
A04 0410 given during these three days, despite Mr& Rusk's personal popularity,
A04 0420 that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat
A04 0430 tentative and exploratory frame of mind, more ready to listen and learn
A04 0440 than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application
A04 0450 to individual danger spots.   The Secretary of State
A04 0460 himself, in his first speech, gave some idea of the tremendous march of
A04 0470 events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the
A04 0480 new administration in the past four months.   But where the core
A04 0490 of ~NATO is concerned, the Secretary of State has not only
A04 0500 reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance,
A04 0510 "cornerstone" of its foreign policy, but has announced that five
A04 0520 nuclear submarines will eventually be at ~NATO's disposal in
A04 0530 European waters.   The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated
A04 0540 a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will
A04 0550 not stand for another setback in Berlin, an affirmation once again taken
A04 0560 up by the council as a whole. #CONFLICT SURVEYED# The secretary's
A04 0570 greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of ~NATO realization
A04 0580 that East-West friction, wherever it take place around the
A04 0590 globe, is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different
A04 0600 societies, and must be treated as such without regard to geographical
A04 0610 distance or lack of apparent connection.   The annual spring
A04 0620 meeting has given an impetus in three main directions: more, deeper,
A04 0630 and more timely political consultation within the alliance, the use
A04 0640 of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (when
A04 0650 ratified) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries,
A04 0660 and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the
A04 0670 maintenance of the nuclear deterrent.   This increase in the
A04 0680 "threshold", as the conventional forces strengthening is called, will
A04 0690 prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months
A04 0700 to come. Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid
A04 0710 down, but never completely fulfilled.
A04 0720 _WASHINGTON_ The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a
A04 0730 Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy
A04 0740 erupts for the first time.   There is little optimism here
A04 0750 that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table
A04 0760 than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos.   The
A04 0770 United States, State Department officials explain, now is mainly
A04 0780 interested in setting up an international inspection system which will
A04 0790 prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring
A04 0800 Thailand and South Viet Nam.   They count on the aid
A04 0810 of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve
A04 0820 this.   The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet
A04 0830 would not become Communist dominated. But it is apparent that no acceptable
A04 0840 formula has been found to prevent such a possibility. #POLICIES
A04 0850 MODIFIED# The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire
A04 0860 in Laos, rather than continue to insist on a verification of the
A04 0870 cease-fire by the international control commission before participating
A04 0880 in the Geneva conference.   This is another of the modifications
A04 0890 of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled
A04 0900 to make. It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to
A04 0910 basic errors made in the previous administration.   Its spokesmen
A04 0920 insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in
A04 0930 military and economic aid policies in the critical areas.   But
A04 0940 with the months moving on- and the immediate confrontations with the
A04 0950 Communists showing no gain for the free world- the question arises:
A04 0960    How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy
A04 0970 decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression?   Former
A04 0980 Vice-President Richard M& Nixon in Detroit called for a
A04 0990 firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union. He was critical
A04 1000 of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory.
A04 1010 #~GOP RESTRAINED# It does not take a Gallup poll to
A04 1020 find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the
A04 1030 situation as Republicans see it. They can hardly restrain themselves
A04 1040 from raising the question of whether Republicans, if they had been
A04 1050 in power, would have made "amateurish and monumental blunders" in
A04 1060 Cuba.   One Republican senator told this correspondent that he
A04 1070 was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration
A04 1080 on this score. His reply, he said, was that he agreed to the
A04 1090 need for unity in the country now. But he further said that it was
A04 1100 better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies
A04 1110 first.   The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through
A04 1120 Senator Thruston B& Morton (~R) of Kentucky, chairman
A04 1130 of the Republican National Committee, that the Kennedy administration
A04 1140 would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition
A04 1150 government susceptible of Communist domination.   Kennedy administration
A04 1160 policies also have been assailed now from another direction
A04 1170 by 70 Harvard, Boston University, Brandeis, and Massachusetts Institute
A04 1180 of Technology educators. #DETENTE URGED# This group pleads
A04 1190 with the administration to "give no further support for the invasion
A04 1200 of Cuba by exile groups". It recommends that the United States
A04 1210 "seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc
A04 1220 by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations;
A04 1230 and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other
A04 1240 parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian
A04 1250 nationalism feeds".   Mr& Nixon, for his part, would oppose
A04 1260 intervention in Cuba without specific provocation. But he did recommend
A04 1270 that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries
A04 1280 shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated.
A04 1290    Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories
A04 1295 in Laos,
A04 1300 almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended
A04 1310 a program that respected, generally, the opinions voiced both by
A04 1320 Mr& Nixon and the professors. #AID PLANS REVAMPED# Very early
A04 1330 in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels,
A04 1340 a high official source disclosed, that the new administration
A04 1350 would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during
A04 1360 the formative period of the administration.   Strenuous efforts
A04 1370 were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements. Policies
A04 1380 on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed. But
A04 1390 thus far there has been no response in kind.   Foreign aid programs
A04 1400 were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to
A04 1410 encourage political reform in recipient nations.   In Laos, the
A04 1420 administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show
A04 1430 determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters
A04 1440 as a useless gesture.   Again and again it asked the Communists
A04 1450 to "freeze" the military situation in Laos. But the Communists
A04 1460 aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate.   And after several
A04 1470 correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the
A04 1480 huge build-up,
A04 1490 administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a
A04 1500 "great service" and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty
A04 1510 Organization.   ~SEATO was steamed up and prepared
A04 1520 contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos. But
A04 1530 the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for
A04 1540 the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos.
A04 1550 (Some ~SEATO nations disagreed, however.)   There
A04 1560 was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded
A04 1570 that Laos was ill suited to be an ally, unlike its more determined
A04 1580 neighbors, Thailand and South Viet Nam.   The administration
A04 1590 declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos. The pro-Western
A04 1600 government, which the United States had helped in a revolt against
A04 1610 the Souvanna Phouma "neutralist" government, never did appear
A04 1620 to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army.   There
A04 1630 certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United
A04 1640 States would not back the pro-Western government to the hilt.
A04 1650    If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an
A04 1660 acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma, whom it felt was
A04 1670 too trusting of Communists, it gradually had to relinquish them.
A04 1680    One factor was the statement of Senator J& W& Fulbright (~D)
A04 1690 of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
A04 1700 He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a
A04 1710 year and a half ago by "encouraging the removal" of Prince Souvanna.
A04 1730 _WASHINGTON_ The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check
A04 1740 the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States.
A04 1750    The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect
A04 1760 upon the "vitality of the nation".   In an important assertion
A04 1770 of national leadership in this field, he has issued an executive
A04 1780 order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency
A04 1790 and Crime, to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory
A04 1800 Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems.   The
A04 1810 President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts
A04 1820 through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to
A04 1830 states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend.
A04 1840 #OFFENSES MULTIPLY# The President has also called upon the Attorney
A04 1850 General, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and
A04 1860 the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts "in the development
A04 1870 of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local
A04 1880 communities in their efforts to cope with the problem.   Simultaneously
A04 1890 the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L&
A04 1900 Hackett, a special assistant ot the Attorney General, as executive
A04 1910 director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth
A04 1920 Crime.   His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the
A04 1930 fact that court cases ond juvenile arrests have more than doubled since
A04 1940 1948, each year showing an increase in offenders.   Among arrests
A04 1950 reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959, about
A04 1960 half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age.
A05 0010    East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin
A05 0020 by appointing a full-time director, Raymond H& Hawksley, the
A05 0030 present city ~CD head, believes.   Mr& Hawksley said yesterday
A05 0040 he would be willing to go before the city council "or anyone
A05 0050 else locally" to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time.
A05 0060    East Providence now has no civil defense program. Mr& Hawksley,
A05 0070 the state's general treasurer, has been a part-time ~CD
A05 0080 director in the city for the last nine years. He is not interested in
A05 0090 being named a full-time director.   Noting that President Kennedy
A05 0100 has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for
A05 0110 the nation's civil defense program, Mr& Hawksley said the federal
A05 0120 government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director.
A05 0130    He expressed the opinion the city could hire a ~CD director
A05 0140 for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount
A05 0145 on
A05 0150 a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs.   Mr& Hawksley
A05 0160 said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents
A05 0170 who would be willing to take the full-time ~CD job. One of these
A05 0180 men is former Fire Chief John A& Laughlin, he said.   Along
A05 0190 with a director, the city should provide a ~CD headquarters so
A05 0200 that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized.
A05 0210 Mr& Hawksley said.   One advantage that would come to
A05 0220 the city in having a full-time director, he said, is that East Providence
A05 0230 would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial
A05 0240 aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense
A05 0250 program.   Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of
A05 0260 such items as radios, sirens and rescue trucks, he said.   Mr&
A05 0270 Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue
A05 0280 trucks, similar to the ~CD vehicle obtained several years ago and
A05 0290 now detailed to the Central Fire Station.   He would assign
A05 0300 one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the
A05 0310 other to the Rumford area.   Speaking of the present status of
A05 0320 civil defense in the city, Mr& Hawksley said he would be willing
A05 0330 to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to
A05 0340 do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack.   The Narragansett
A05 0350 Race Track grounds is one assembly point, he said, and a drive-in
A05 0360 theater in Seekonk would be another. Riverside residents would
A05 0370 go to the Seekonk assembly point.   Mr& Hawksley said he was
A05 0380 not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to
A05 0390 assemble in case of an air attack.   Such vital information, he
A05 0400 said, has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular
A05 0410 intervals for residents to know.   If the city council fails to
A05 0420 consider appointment of a full-time ~CD director, Mr& Hawksley
A05 0430 said, then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a
A05 0440 civil defense organization will be developed locally.   One of
A05 0450 the first things he would do, he said, would be to organize classes in
A05 0460 first aid. Other steps would be developed after information drifts down
A05 0470 to the local level from the federal government.
A05 0480    Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible
A05 0490 revisions in mind.   Governor Notte said last night he
A05 0500 plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations
A05 0510 for possible changes in time for the next session of the General
A05 0520 Assembly.   The governor's move into the so-called "blue
A05 0530 law" controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R&
A05 0540 Grant, deputy city clerk of Central Falls. A copy was released to
A05 0550 the press.   Mr& Notte was responding to a resolution adopted
A05 0560 by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state
A05 0570 house by Miss Grant. The resolution urges the governor to have a
A05 0580 complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision
A05 0590 at the next session of the legislature.   While the city
A05 0600 council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review,
A05 0610 Mr& Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty&
A05 0620 Gen& J& Joseph Nugent to get "the benefit of his views".
A05 0630 He will then appoint the study committee with Mr& Nugent's
A05 0640 cooperation, the governor said.   "I would expect the proposed
A05 0650 committee to hold public hearings", Mr& Notte said, "to obtain
A05 0660 the views of the general public and religious, labor and special-interest
A05 0670 groups affected by these laws".   The governor wrote
A05 0680 Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time "with the continuous
A05 0690 problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers
A05 0700 as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales".   The
A05 0710 attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce
A05 0720 the blue laws. Should there be evidence they are shirking, he has
A05 0730 said, the state police will step into the situation.   There
A05 0740 has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in
A05 0750 Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales
A05 0760 laws. The statutes, similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island
A05 0770 and dating back in some instances to colonial times, severely limit
A05 0780 the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath.   The
A05 0790 Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more
A05 0800 foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery
A05 0810 and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday.   The only
A05 0820 day they "have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on
A05 0830 Sunday", the council's resolution said. The small shops "must
A05 0840 be retained, for they provide essential service to the community",
A05 0850 according to the resolution, which added that they "also are the source
A05 0860 of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors". It declares that
A05 0870 Sunday sales licenses provide "great revenue" to the local government.
A05 0880    The council advised the governor that "large supermarkets,
A05 0890 factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business"
A05 0900 on Sunday. They "operate on a volume basis", it was contended,
A05 0910 "and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital
A05 0920 shopping needs of the community".
A05 0930    Liberals and conservatives in both parties- Democratic and
A05 0940 Republican- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties,
A05 0950 George H& Reama, nationally known labor-management expert, said
A05 0960 here yesterday.   Mr& Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence
A05 0970 at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about
A05 0980 half of the people in the country want the "welfare" type of government
A05 0990 and the other half want a free enterprise system. He suggested
A05 1000 that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull
A05 1010 at the right lever for him on election day.   He said he was "confessing
A05 1020 that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910".
A05 1030 That, he added, was when he was "a very young man, a machinist and
A05 1040 toolmaker by trade.   "That was before I studied law. Some
A05 1050 of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist
A05 1060 Party. The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist
A05 1070 track. He steered me to the right track- the free enterprise track".
A05 1080    He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910, the party
A05 1090 called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of
A05 1100 all resources. He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever
A05 1110 gaining a national victory, most of its original program has come to
A05 1120 pass under both major parties.   Mr& Reama, who retired as vice
A05 1130 president of the American Screw Co& in 1955 said, "Both parties
A05 1140 in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth
A05 1150 in the gross national product- but neither told us how to achieve it".
A05 1160    He said he favors wage increases for workers- "but manufacturers
A05 1170 are caught in a profit squeeze"- and raises should only
A05 1180 come when the public is conditioned to higher prices, he added.
A05 1190    Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy,
A05 1200 Mr& Reama said: "A Socialist is a person who believes
A05 1210 in dividing everything he does not own". Mr& Reama, far from
A05 1220 really being retired, is engaged in industrial relations counseling.
A05 1230    A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston
A05 1240 taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped
A05 1250 will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town.
A05 1260    William A& Martinelli, chairman of the Citizens Group
A05 1270 of Johnston, transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right
A05 1280 hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council
A05 1290 President Raymond Fortin Sr&.   The law which governs
A05 1300 home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the
A05 1310 chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures
A05 1320 within 10 days and Mr& Martinelli happens to hold that post.
A05 1330    Mr& Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough
A05 1340 signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter
A05 1350 and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70
A05 1360 days. He explained that by law the council must establish procedures
A05 1370 for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers
A05 1380 completes its work.   A difference of opinion arose between Mr&
A05 1390 Martinelli and John P& Bourcier, town solicitor, over the exact
A05 1400 manner in which the vote is handled. Mr& Martinelli has, in recent
A05 1410 weeks, been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called
A05 1420 for the vote, while Mr& Bourcier said that a special election
A05 1430 might be called instead.   Mr& Bourcier said that he had consulted
A05 1440 several Superior Court justices in the last week and received
A05 1450 opinions favoring both procedures. He assured Mr& Martinelli and
A05 1460 the council that he would study the correct method and report back to
A05 1470 the council as soon as possible.   Mr& Martinelli said yesterday
A05 1480 that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to
A05 1490 plan further strategy in the charter movement. He said that the group
A05 1500 has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present, but
A05 1510 that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes.
A05 1520    "After inspiring this, I think we should certainly follow through
A05 1530 on it", he declared. "It has become our responsibility and I
A05 1540 hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement".
A05 1550 He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members
A05 1560 of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan
A05 1570 ballot for posts on the charter commission.   "Our most immediate
A05 1580 goal is to increase public awareness of the movement", he indicated,
A05 1590 "and to tell them what this will mean for the town". He expects
A05 1600 that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled
A05 1610 during the last week in September.   Some opposition to the home
A05 1620 rule movement started to be heard yesterday, with spokesmen for the
A05 1630 town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home
A05 1640 rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter.
A05 1650 Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks, it was indicated.
A05 1660    Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter
A05 1670 was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain
A05 1680 signatures under what were termed "false pretenses". Several signers
A05 1690 affixed their names, it was learned, after being told that no tax
A05 1700 increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly
A05 1710 and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town
A05 1720 take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system.
A05 1730    Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty
A05 1740 to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may
A05 1750 be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting.
A05 1760    Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday
A05 1770 he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A&
A05 1780 Abatuno to draft the ordinance.   At the last session of the
A05 1790 General Assembly, the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance
A05 1800 as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective.
A05 1810 Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation.
A05 1820    At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District
A05 1830 Court for disposition. Local police have hesitated to prosecute them
A05 1840 because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense.
A06 0010 _PLAINFIELD_- James P& Mitchell and Sen& Walter H& Jones
A06 0020 ~R-Bergen, last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign
A06 0030 issue a remark by Richard J& Hughes, Democratic gubernatorial
A06 0040 candidate, that the ~GOP is "Campaigning on the carcass
A06 0050 of Eisenhower Republicanism".   Mitchell was for using it, Jones
A06 0060 against, and Sen& Wayne Dumont Jr& ~R-Warren did not
A06 0070 mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke
A06 0080 at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel.
A06 0090 The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield
A06 0100 Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains
A06 0110 Country Club. It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in
A06 0120 Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs.
A06 0130    Hughes said Monday, "It is the apparent intention of
A06 0140 the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower
A06 0150 Republicanism, but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood
A06 0160 congealed after Eisenhower retired. Now he's gone, the Republican
A06 0170 Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the
A06 0180 people of the state". Sunday he had added, "We can love Eisenhower
A06 0190 the man, even if we considered him a mediocre president **h but
A06 0200 there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership".
A06 0210    Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue
A06 0220 in the primary and the fall campaign. "How can a man with any degree
A06 0230 of common decency charge this"? he asked. The former secretary
A06 0240 of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican "and proud
A06 0250 to have absorbed his philosophy" while working in his adminstration.
A06 0260    Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's
A06 0270 Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism
A06 0280 was a dead issue. #REGRETS ATTACK# Jones said he regretted Hughes
A06 0290 had made a personal attack on a past president. "He is wrong to
A06 0300 inject Eisenhower into this campaign", he said, "because the primary
A06 0310 is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing
A06 0320 an old national campaign".   The audience last night did
A06 0330 not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark.
A06 0340    Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary. He
A06 0350 then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign. State
A06 0360 aid to schools, the continuance of railroad passenger service, the proper
A06 0370 uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority, and
A06 0380 making New Jersey attractive to new industry. #DECRIES JOBLESSNESS#
A06 0390 Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said
A06 0400 the Meyner administration and the Republican-controlled State Senate
A06 0410 "Must share the blame for this". Nothing that Plainfield
A06 0420 last year had lost the Mack Truck Co& plant, he said industry will
A06 0430 not come into this state until there is tax reform.   "But
A06 0440 I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time", Mitchell
A06 0450 said.   Jones, unhappy that the candidates were limited to
A06 0460 eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions, saved his barbs
A06 0470 for Mitchell. He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government
A06 0480 in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for
A06 0490 aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises.   "He
A06 0500 calls for help while saying he is against centralization, but you
A06 0510 can't have it both ways", Jones said. The state is now faced with
A06 0520 the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities, real
A06 0530 estate or motor vehicles, he said, "and I challenge Mitchell to
A06 0540 tell the people where he stands on the tax issue". #DEFENDS IKE#
A06 0550 Earlier, Mitchell said in a statement:   "I think that all
A06 0560 Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President
A06 0570 Eisenhower by Richard J& Hughes. His reference to 'discredited
A06 0580 carcass' or 'tattered remains' of the president's leadership
A06 0590 is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest
A06 0600 war in all history, to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by
A06 0610 the American people as president of the United States, and who has
A06 0620 been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the
A06 0625 free
A06 0630 nations.   "I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking
A06 0640 a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and
A06 0650 bad taste.   "Such a vicious statement can only have its origin
A06 0660 in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known
A06 0670 by condemning a man of world stature. It can only rebound to Mr&
A06 0680 Hughes' discredit". #SEES JONES AHEAD# Sen& Charles W&
A06 0690 Sandman, ~R-Cape May, said today Jones will run well ahead
A06 0700 of his ~GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination. Sandman,
A06 0710 state campaign chairman for Jones, was addressing a meeting in the
A06 0720 Military Park Hotel, Newark, of Essex County leaders and campaign
A06 0730 managers for Jones.   Sandman told the gathering that reports
A06 0740 from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones
A06 0750 will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with the largest majority
A06 0760 given a candidate in recent years.   Sandman said: "The
A06 0770 announcement that Sen& Clifford Case ~R-N&J&, has decided
A06 0780 to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr& Mitchell
A06 0790 is a dead giveaway. It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate
A06 0800 who has proven he cannot answer any questions about New Jersey's
A06 0810 problems.   "We have witnessed in this campaign the effort
A06 0820 to project Mr& Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from
A06 0830 Washington. That failed.   "We are now witnessing an effort
A06 0840 to transfer to Mr& Mitchell some of the glow of Sen& Case's
A06 0850 candidacy of last year. That, too, will fail".   Sandman announced
A06 0860 the appointment of Mrs& Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330
A06 0870 Woodland Ave&, Westfield, as state chairman of the Republican
A06 0880 Women for Jones Committee.   Mrs& Greenfield is president
A06 0890 of the Westfield Women's Republican Club and is a Westfield county
A06 0900 committeewoman.
A06 0910    County Supervisor Weldon R& Sheets, who is a candidate for
A06 0920 the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, today called for an end to
A06 0930 paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them. The
A06 0940 proposal, Sheets said, represents part of his program for election
A06 0950 reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a "lip
A06 0960 service word".   Sheets said that his proposed law would offer
A06 0970 state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines, enabling
A06 0980 counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge.
A06 0990 Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines
A06 1000 in the state by January, 1964.   Although he pointed out
A06 1010 that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful,
A06 1020 he added that the vital interest in election results transcended
A06 1030 county lines.
A06 1040    The candidacy of Mayor James J& Sheeran of West Orange,
A06 1050 for the Republican nomination for sheriff
A06 1060 of Essex County, was supported
A06 1070 today by Edward W& Roos, West Orange public safety commissioner.
A06 1080    Sheeran, a lawyer and former ~FBI man is running
A06 1090 against the Republican organization's candidate, Freeholder William
A06 1100 MacDonald, for the vacancy left by the resignation of Neil Duffy,
A06 1110 now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals.   "My
A06 1120 experience as public safety commissioner", Roos said, "has shown
A06 1130 me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement
A06 1140 experience, and preferably one who is a lawyer. Jim Sheeran fits
A06 1150 that description".
A06 1160 _TRENTON_- William J& Seidel, state fire warden in the Department
A06 1170 of Conservation and Economic Development, has retired after
A06 1180 36 years of service.   A citation from Conservation Commissioner
A06 1190 Salvatore A& Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction
A06 1200 in the number of forest fires in the state.   Seidel joined the
A06 1210 department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921
A06 1220 from the University of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment
A06 1230 with private lumber companies. In October 1944, he was appointed
A06 1240 state warden and chief of the Forest Fire Section.   Under
A06 1250 his supervision, the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques
A06 1260 as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows
A06 1270 and tractor units for fire fighting.   He also expanded and modernized
A06 1280 the radio system with a central control station. He introduced
A06 1290 regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training
A06 1300 for section wardens. He is credited with setting up an annual
A06 1310 co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the Red Cross
A06 1320 and State Department of Education.
A06 1330 _BOONTON_- Richard J& Hughes made his Morris County debut
A06 1340 in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night
A06 1350 with a pledge "to carry the issues to every corner of the state".
A06 1360    He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members
A06 1370 at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn: "When I come back here
A06 1380 after the November election you'll think, 'You're my man-
A06 1390 you're the kind of governor we're glad we elected'".   He
A06 1400 said, "We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what
A06 1410 is right and just, and not what is expedient at the time". #ATTACKS
A06 1420 REPUBLICANS# In his only attack on the Republicans, Hughes said,
A06 1430 "The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over
A06 1440 their feet for popular slogans to win the primary. But we'll have
A06 1450 a liberal, well planned, forward looking, honest platform. We'll not
A06 1460 talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the
A06 1470 other side in Hudson.   "We'll take the truth to the people,
A06 1480 and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party
A06 1490 in November".   He said, "You can see signs of the Republicans'
A06 1500 feeble attack on the Meyner administration. But I shall
A06 1510 campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead".
A06 1520    He urged New Jersey to "become a full partner in the courageous
A06 1530 actions of President Kennedy". He called for a greater
A06 1540 attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern
A06 1550 states, and a strong fight against discrimination in business and
A06 1560 industry.   "We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean",
A06 1570 the former Superior Court judge said. "To prevent hoodlums
A06 1580 from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican administration
A06 1590 in the early 1940s".   Calling the Democrats the "party
A06 1600 that lives, breathes and thinks for the good of the people", Hughes
A06 1610 asked, "a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard
A06 1620 toward victory in November".   Hughes supported Gov&
A06 1630 Meyner's "Green Acres" plan for saving large tracts of open
A06 1640 land from the onrush of urban development. He said legislation for
A06 1650 a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be
A06 1660 introduced Monday. #CONSERVATION PLAN# The plan will provide $45
A06 1670 million for purchase of open land by the state. The other $15 million
A06 1680 is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis.
A06 1690 Hughes said, "This is not a plan to conquer space- but to conserve
A06 1700 it", pointing out the state population has increased 125,000 each
A06 1710 year since 1950. He said "Morris County is rapidly changing and
A06 1720 unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas, there will be no
A06 1725 land
A06 1730 left to preserve".   Hughes would not comment on tax reforms
A06 1740 or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved. He
A06 1750 said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he
A06 1760 was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans. "After the
A06 1770 primary", he promised, "I'll be explicit on where I stand to
A06 1780 bring you a strong, dynamic administration. I'm not afraid to tangle
A06 1790 with the Republican nominee".
A06 1800 _TRENTON_- Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee
A06 1810 who are retiring- voluntarily- this year were honored yesterday by
A06 1820 their colleagues.   The outgoing members, whose four-year terms
A06 1830 will expire a week after the April 18 primary election, received carved
A06 1840 wooden elephants, complete with ivory tusks, to remember the state
A06 1850 committee by.   There may be other 1961 state committee retirements
A06 1860 come April 18, but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican
A06 1870 voters.   A special presentation was made to Mrs& Geraldine
A06 1880 Thompson of Red Bank, who is stepping down after 35 years on
A06 1890 the committee. She also was the original ~GOP national committeewoman
A06 1900 from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women's
A06 1910 suffrage amendment. She served one four-year term on the national
A06 1920 committee.
A07 0010    Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders
A07 0020 and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided
A07 0030 to seek a third term with Paul R& Screvane and Abraham D& Beame
A07 0040 as running mates.   At the same time reaction among anti-organization
A07 0050 Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's
A07 0060 reported plan was generally favorable.   Some anti-organization
A07 0070 Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal
A07 0080 fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the
A07 0090 last three years.   The resentment among Democratic organization
A07 0100 leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at
A07 0110 the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting
A07 0120 the leaders. Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr& Wagner
A07 0130 regarded himself as bigger than the party. #OPPOSITION REPORTED#
A07 0140 Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to
A07 0150 induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr&
A07 0160 Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept& 7 Democratic
A07 0170 primary.   These contend there is a serious question as to whether
A07 0180 Mr& Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file
A07 0190 in the city. Their view is that last-minute changes the Mayor is proposing
A07 0200 to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of
A07 0210 his performance as Mayor.   In an apparent effort to head off
A07 0220 such a rival primary slate, Mr& Wagner talked by telephone yesterday
A07 0230 with Representative Charles A& Buckley, the Bronx Democratic
A07 0240 leader, and with Joseph T& Sharkey, the Brooklyn Democratic
A07 0250 leader. #MAYOR VISITS BUCKLEY# As usual, he made no attempt to get
A07 0260 in touch with Carmine G& De Sapio, the Manhattan leader. He
A07 0270 is publicly on record as believing Mr& De Sapio should be replaced
A07 0280 for the good of the party.   Last night the Mayor visited Mr&
A07 0290 Buckley at the Bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situation.
A07 0300 Apparently he believes Mr& Buckley holds the key to the Democratic
A07 0310 organization's acceptance of his choices for running mates
A07 0320 without a struggle.   In talks with Mr& Buckley last week
A07 0330 in Washington, the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent
A07 0340 to dropping Controller Lawrence E& Gerosa, who lives in the
A07 0350 Bronx, from this year's ticket. But Mr& Buckley seems to have
A07 0360 assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr& Gerosa's successor.
A07 0370 #SCREVANE AND BEAME HAILED# The Mayor declined in two interviews
A07 0380 with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he
A07 0390 had decided to run and wanted Mr& Screvane, who lives in Queens,
A07 0400 to replace Abe Stark, the incumbent, as the candidate for President
A07 0410 of the City Council and Mr& Beame, who lives in Brooklyn, to
A07 0420 replace Mr& Gerosa as the candidate for Controller.   The
A07 0430 Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties Feis on the Hunter
A07 0440 College Campus in the Bronx. After his speech, reporters asked
A07 0450 him about the report of his political intentions, published in yesterday's
A07 0460 New York Times. The Mayor said:   "It didn't
A07 0470 come from me. But as I have said before, if I announce my candidacy,
A07 0480 I will have something definite to say about running mates".
A07 0490 _BOSTON, JUNE 16_- A wave of public resentment against corruption
A07 0500 in government is rising in Massachusetts.   There is a tangible
A07 0510 feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics. The taxi driver
A07 0520 taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state
A07 0530 are "all the same".   "It's 'See Joe, see Jim'",
A07 0540 he says. "The hand is out".   A political scientist writes
A07 0550 of the growth of "alienated voters", who "believe that voting
A07 0560 is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are
A07 0570 corrupt, selfish and beyond popular control. **h These voters view the
A07 0580 political process as a secret conspiracy, the object of which is to
A07 0590 plunder them".   Corruption is hardly a recent development in
A07 0600 the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of Edwin
A07 0610 O'Connor's novel, "The Last Hurrah". But there are reasons
A07 0620 for the current spotlight on the subject.   A succession of
A07 0630 highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year.
A07 0640 Graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought
A07 0650 on state and Federal investigations. And the election of President
A07 0660 Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of
A07 0670 his home state.   A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly
A07 0680 escape the impression that petty chicanery, or worse, is the norm in
A07 0685 Massachusetts
A07 0690 public life. Day after day some new episode is reported.
A07 0700    The state Public Works Department is accused of having spent
A07 0710 $8,555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront
A07 0720 property. An assistant attorney general is directed to investigate.
A07 0730 _WASHINGTON, JUNE 18_- Congress starts another week tomorrow with
A07 0740 sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers.   In the
A07 0750 Senate, several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict
A07 0760 or opposition. In the House, the Southern-Republican coalition is
A07 0770 expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration's
A07 0780 housing bill, while more jockeying is expected in an attempt
A07 0790 to advance the aid-to-education bill.   The housing bill is now
A07 0800 in the House Rules Committee. It is expected to be reported out Tuesday,
A07 0810 but this is a little uncertain.   The panel's action depends
A07 0820 on the return of Representative James W& Trimble, Democrat
A07 0830 of Arkansas, who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn's forces
A07 0840 in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor. Mr& Trimble
A07 0850 has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday. #LEADERSHIP
A07 0860 IS HOPEFUL# The housing bill is expected to encounter strong
A07 0870 opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative
A07 0880 Republicans. The Democratic leadership, however, hopes to pass it
A07 0890 sometime this week.   The $6,100,000,000 measure, which was passed
A07 0900 last Monday by the Senate, provides for forty-year mortgages at low
A07 0910 down-payments for moderate-income families. It also provides for funds
A07 0920 to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories.   The education
A07 0930 bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the Rules Committee,
A07 0940 where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the
A07 0950 Administration are balking because of the religious controversy. They
A07 0960 are James J& Delaney of Queens and Thomas P& O'Neill Jr&
A07 0970 of Massachusetts. #THREE GROUPS TO MEET# What could rescue
A07 0980 the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the National
A07 0990 Defense Education Act of 1958. This would provide for long-term
A07 1000 Federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school
A07 1010 facilities for teaching science, languages and mathematics.
A07 1020    Mr& Delaney and Mr& O'Neill are not willing to vote on the
A07 1030 public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the House
A07 1040 Education and Labor Committee.
A07 1050    About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary
A07 1060 agencies will be carried out by religious groups, according to an official
A07 1070 of the corps.   In the $40,000,000 budget that has been submitted
A07 1080 for Congressional approval, $26,000,000 would be spent through
A07 1090 universities and private voluntary agencies.   Twelve projects
A07 1100 proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage, Gordon
A07 1110 Boyce, director of relations with the voluntary agencies, said in
A07 1120 a Washington interview. Six of these were proposed by religious groups.
A07 1130 They will be for teaching, agriculture and community development
A07 1140 in Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.
A07 1150 #QUESTION RAISED# Interviews with several church leaders have disclosed
A07 1160 that this development has raised the question whether the Peace
A07 1170 Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over
A07 1180 methods, means and goals.   There are a number of ways this could
A07 1190 happen, the churchmen pointed out, and here is an example:
A07 1200 Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came
A07 1210 to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled. When he protested,
A07 1220 the hotel owner said:   "Why do you worry? The
A07 1225 U& S& Government is paying for it. The U& S& Government
A07 1230 pays for all its overseas workers". #MISSIONARY
A07 1240 EXPLAINS# "I don't work for the Government", the American
A07 1250 said. "I'm a missionary".   The hotel owner shrugged.
A07 1260 "Same thing", he said.   And then, some churchmen remarked,
A07 1270 there is a more classical church-state problem:   Can religious
A07 1280 agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their
A07 1290 projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation
A07 1300 of church and state?   R& Sargent Shriver Jr&, director
A07 1310 of the corps, is certain that they can. No religious group, he
A07 1320 declared in an interview, will receive Peace Corps funds unless it
A07 1330 forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes.
A07 1340 _MOSCOW, JUNE 18_- At a gay party in the Kremlin for President
A07 1350 Sukarno of Indonesia, Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets
A07 1360 and said, beaming: "Look, he took everything I had"!
A07 1370 Mr& Khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful
A07 1380 banker. Indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of
A07 1390 Asia, Africa and Latin America that are receiving Soviet aid.
A07 1400    The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist bloc are rapidly
A07 1410 expanding their economic, technical and military assistance to
A07 1420 the uncommitted nations.   The Communist countries allocated more
A07 1430 than $1,000,000,000 in economic aid alone last year, according to Western
A07 1440 estimates. This was the biggest annual outlay since the Communist
A07 1450 program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning
A07 1460 in 1954. In 1960 more than 6,000 Communist technicians were present
A07 1470 in those countries.
A07 1480 _UNITED NATIONS, N& Y&, JUNE 18_- A committee of experts has
A07 1490 recommended that a country's population be considered in the distribution
A07 1500 of professional posts at the United Nations. This was disclosed
A07 1510 today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet
A07 1520 Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United
A07 1530 Nations.   One effect of the proposal, which puts a premium
A07 1540 on population instead of economic strength, as in the past, would
A07 1550 be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries
A07 1560 as India. India is the most populous United Nations member with more
A07 1570 than 400,000,000 inhabitants.   The new formula for filling
A07 1580 staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations
A07 1590 made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report. The report
A07 1600 was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of
A07 1610 the organization of the United Nations. #FORMULA IS DUE THIS WEEK#
A07 1620 The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
A07 1630 is expected to receive the report this week. The jobs formula is
A07 1640 understood to follow these lines: _@_ Each of the organization's
A07 1650 ninety-nine members would get two professional posts, such as
A07 1660 political affairs officer, a department head or an economist, to start.
A07 1670 #@# Each member would get one post for each 10,000,000 people
A07 1680 in its population up to 150,000,000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts.
A07 1690 #@# Each member with a population above 150,000,000 would
A07 1700 get one additional post for each additional 30,000,000 people up to
A07 1710 an unspecified cut-off point.
A07 1720 _GENEVA, JUNE 18_- The three leaders of Laos agreed today to begin
A07 1730 negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would
A07 1740 unite the war-ridden kingdom.   The decision was made in Zurich
A07 1750 by Prince Boun Oum, Premier of the pro-Western royal Government;
A07 1760 Prince Souvanna Phouma, leader of the nation's neutralists
A07 1770 and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc, and Prince Souphanouvong,
A07 1780 head of the pro-Communist Pathet Lao forces. The latter
A07 1785 two are half-brothers.   Their
A07 1790 joint statement was welcomed by the Western delegations who will attend
A07 1800 tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference
A07 1810 on the future of Laos. An agreement among the Princes on a coalition
A07 1820 government would ease their task, diplomats conceded. But no
A07 1830 one was overly optimistic. #TACTICS STUDIED IN GENEVA# W& Averell
A07 1840 Harriman of the United States, Malcolm MacDonald of Britain,
A07 1860 Maurice Couve de Murville, France's Foreign Minister, and Howard
A07 1870 C& Green, Canada's Minister of External Affairs, concluded,
A07 1880 meanwhile, a round of consultations here on future tactics in the
A07 1890 conference. The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week.
A07 1900    Princess Moune, Prince Souvanna Phouma's young daughter,
A07 1910 read the Princes' statement. They had a two-hour luncheon together
A07 1920 in "an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation", she
A07 1930 said.   The three Laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for
A07 1940 their talks, which are to last three days.   The Princess said
A07 1950 it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached
A07 1960 after three days. #TO DEAL WITH PRINCIPLES# The meetings in
A07 1970 Zurich, the statement said, would deal only with principles that would
A07 1980 guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government.
A08 0010    Appointment of William S& Pfaff Jr&, 41, as promotion
A08 0015 manager
A08 0020 of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was announced Saturday
A08 0030 by John F& Tims, president of the company.   Pfaff succeeds
A08 0040 Martin Burke, who resigned.   The new promotion manager
A08 0050 has been employed by the company since January, 1946, as a commercial
A08 0060 artist in the advertising department.   He is a native of New
A08 0070 Orleans and attended Allen Elementary school, Fortier High school
A08 0080 and Soule business
A08 0090 college.   From June, 1942, until December,
A08 0100 1945, Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps. While in the service
A08 0110 he attended radio school at Scott Field in Belleville, Ill&.
A08 0120    Before entering the service, Pfaff for five years did clerical
A08 0130 work with a general merchandising and wholesale firm in New Orleans.
A08 0140    He is married to the former Audrey Knecht and has a daughter,
A08 0150 Karol, 13. They reside at 4911 Miles dr&.
A08 0160 _WASHINGTON_- Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected
A08 0170 along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House
A08 0180 for the big inaugural parade on Jan& 20.   Assuming the
A08 0190 weather is halfway decent that day, hundreds of thousands of persons
A08 0200 will mass along this thoroughfare as President John F& Kennedy
A08 0210 and retiring President Dwight D& Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill
A08 0220 following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial
A08 0230 route.   Pennsylvania Avenue, named for one of the original
A08 0240 13 states, perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District
A08 0250 of Columbia from a commercial standpoint. But from a historic viewpoint
A08 0260 none can approach it. #MANY BUILDINGS# Within view of the
A08 0270 avenue are some of the United States government's tremendous buildings,
A08 0280 plus shrines and monuments. Of course, 1600 Pennsylvania, the
A08 0290 White House, is the most famous address of the free world.
A08 0300 Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes
A08 0310 together with Constitution Avenue, begins a series of great federal
A08 0320 buildings, some a block long and all about seven-stories high.
A08 0330    Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue, now
A08 0340 about 169 years old. In the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand
A08 0350 persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade. They were the suffragettes
A08 0360 and they wanted to vote. In the 1920 presidential election
A08 0370 they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time. #SEATS
A08 0380 ON SQUARE# Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from
A08 0390 the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the National Archives
A08 0400 building where hundreds of thousands of this country's most valuable
A08 0410 records are kept. Also the department of justice building is
A08 0420 located where J& Edgar Hoover presides over the federal bureau of
A08 0430 investigation.   Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania,
A08 0440 powered with lines that are underground.   Many spectators
A08 0450 will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering Lafayette Square,
A08 0460 opposite the White House. In this historic square are several
A08 0470 statutes, but the one that stands out over the others is that of Gen&
A08 0480 Andrew Jackson, hero of the Battle of New Orleans.   Moving
A08 0490 past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette Square will
A08 0500 be at least 40 marching units. About 16,000 military members of all
A08 0510 branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade.   Division
A08 0520 one of the parade will be the service academies. Division two will
A08 0530 include the representations of Massachusetts and Texas, the respective
A08 0540 states of the President and of Vice-President L& B& Johnson.
A08 0550 Then will come nine other states in the order of their admission
A08 0560 to the union.   Division three will be headed by the Marines
A08 0570 followed by 12 states; division four will be headed by the Navy,
A08 0580 followed by 11 states; division five, by the Air Force followed
A08 0585 by
A08 0590 11 states. Division six will be headed by the Coast Guard, followed
A08 0600 by the reserve forces of all services, five states, Puerto Rico, the
A08 0610 Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the trust territories and
A08 0620 the Canal Zone.
A08 0630 _JACKSON, MISS&_- What does 1961 offer in political and governmental
A08 0640 developments in Mississippi?   Even for those who have
A08 0650 been observing the political scene a long time, no script from the past
A08 0660 is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political
A08 0670 future.   This is largely because of the unpredictability of the
A08 0680 man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected
A08 0690 leader of its two million inhabitants- Gov& Ross Barnett.
A08 0700    Barnett, who came into office with no previous experience in public
A08 0710 administration, has surrounded himself with confusion which not only
A08 0720 keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well.   Consequently,
A08 0730 it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction
A08 0740 the Barnett administration will take in the coming year. #COULD
A08 0750 BE SCRAMBLE# Some predict the administration will settle down during
A08 0760 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far.
A08 0770 The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady
A08 0780 stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments
A08 0790 by Barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's
A08 0800 office.   There are many who predict that should Barnett decide
A08 0810 to call the Legislature back into special session, it will really
A08 0820 throw his administration into a scramble.   Certainly nobody
A08 0830 will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett
A08 0840 will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful
A08 0850 "honeymoon" he had in the 1960 legislative session.   If Barnett
A08 0860 doesn't call a special session in 1961, it will be the first
A08 0870 year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or
A08 0880 special session.   The odds favor a special session, more than
A08 0890 likely early in the year. #DISTRICTS ISSUE# Legislators always get
A08 0900 restless for a special session (whether for the companionship or the
A08 0910 $22.50 per diem is not certain) and if they start agitating. Barnett
A08 0920 is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure.   The issue
A08 0930 which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive
A08 0940 problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six
A08 0950 to five to eliminate one congressional seat.   With eyes focused
A08 0960 on the third congressional district, the historic Delta district, and
A08 0970 Congressman Frank E& Smith as the one most likely to go, the redistricting
A08 0980 battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers
A08 0990 from the Delta have held in the Legislature.   Mississippi's
A08 1000 relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads
A08 1010 during 1961, with the first Democratic president in eight years
A08 1020 in the White House.   Split badly during the recent presidential
A08 1030 election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and
A08 1040 independents, the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a wreck.
A08 1050 And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together.
A08 1060 #FUTURE CLOUDED# Barnett, as the titular head of the Democratic
A08 1070 party, apparently must make the move to reestablish relations
A08 1080 with the national Democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist
A08 1090 ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary.
A08 1100 With a Democratic administration, party patronage would normally begin
A08 1110 to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity
A08 1120 in the November election.   Now, the picture is clouded, and even
A08 1130 ~US Sens& James O& Eastland and John C& Stennis, who
A08 1140 remained loyal to the ticket, are uncertain of their status.
A08 1150 Reports are that it is more than probability that the four congressmen
A08 1160 from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped
A08 1170 of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen.
A08 1180 _BATON ROUGE, LA&_- The Gov& Jimmie H& Davis administration
A08 1190 appears to face a difficult year in 1961, with the governor's
A08 1200 theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses.   The
A08 1210 year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome
A08 1220 issue. But it might give way shortly to another vexing issue-
A08 1230 that of finances in state government.   The transition from segregation
A08 1240 to finances might already be in progress, in the form of an administration
A08 1250 proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3
A08 1260 per cent.   The administration has said the sales tax proposal
A08 1270 is merely part of the segregation strategy, since the revenues from the
A08 1280 increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program.   But the
A08 1290 tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused
A08 1300 legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all
A08 1310 shortage of cash than to segregation. #LEGISLATORS WEARY#
A08 1320 Indeed, the administration's curious position on the sales tax was
A08 1330 a major factor in contributing to its defeat. The administration could
A08 1340 not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program.
A08 1350    The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies
A08 1360 revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining
A08 1370 whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote.   The
A08 1380 tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when
A08 1390 the Legislature reconvenes.   Davis may use the tax bill as a
A08 1400 means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature
A08 1410 to normalcy.   If it fails to pass, he can throw up his hands and
A08 1420 say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent
A08 1430 integration. He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature.
A08 1435    Actually,
A08 1440 Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway.
A08 1450 Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing
A08 1460 battle to block token integration.   This is not the sort
A08 1470 of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly. They would
A08 1480 like to convey the notion something is being done, even though it is
A08 1490 something they know to be ineffectual. #UNDERLYING CONCERN# Passage
A08 1500 of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect
A08 1510 a transition. He could tell the Legislature they had provided the
A08 1520 needed funds to carry on the battle.   Then he could tell them to
A08 1530 go home, while the administration continued to wage the battle with
A08 1540 the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in
A08 1550 over an eight months period.   It is difficult to be certain how
A08 1560 the administration views that $28 million, since the views of one leader
A08 1570 may not be the same as the views of another one.   But if
A08 1580 the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a
A08 1590 grant-in-aid program, a not unlikely conclusion, it could very well seek
A08 1600 a way to use the money for other purposes.   This would be in
A08 1610 perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration-
A08 1620 the shortage of cash. It could become an acute problem in the coming
A08 1630 fiscal year.   If the administration does not succeed in passing
A08 1640 the sales tax bill, or any other tax bill, it could very well be
A08 1650 faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting
A08 1660 dilemma.   Since the constitution forbids introduction
A08 1670 of a tax bill at a fiscal session, the administration will either have
A08 1680 to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues.
A08 1690 #CONSTANT PROBLEM# In either case, it could call a special session
A08 1700 of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising
A08 1710 additional revenues through a tax raiser.   The prospect of cutting
A08 1720 back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor. It is one
A08 1730 that most try to avoid, as long as they can see an alternative approach
A08 1740 to the problem.   But if all alternatives should be clearly
A08 1745 blocked
A08 1750 off, it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps
A08 1760 to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature.
A08 1770    This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by
A08 1780 the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature, so it would be more
A08 1790 receptive to a tax proposal later in the year.   A constant problem
A08 1800 confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge
A08 1810 by his foes that he has not tried to economize.   Any tax bill
A08 1820 also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using
A08 1830 their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves.
A08 1840    The new year might see some house-cleaning, either genuine or
A08 1850 token, depending upon developments, to give Davis an opportunity to
A08 1860 combat some of these criticisms.
A09 0010    City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the
A09 0020 bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage
A09 0030 of a private contracting company which had "an inside track"
A09 0040 with the city.   Estimates of the city's loss in the $344,000
A09 0050 job have ranged as high as $200,000. #'SHORTCUTS' UNNOTICED#
A09 0060 Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co& contracted to
A09 0070 do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than
A09 0080 the "legitimate" bids of competing contractors.   The Hughes
A09 0090 concern then took "shortcuts" on the project but got paid anyway,
A09 0100 Hemphill said.   The Controller's charge of rigging was
A09 0110 the latest development in an investigation which also brought these
A09 0120 disclosures Tuesday:   {The city has sued for the full amount
A09 0130 of the $172,400 performance bond covering the contract.   The
A09 0140 Philadelphia Transportation Co& is investigating the part its
A09 0150 organization played in reviewing the project.   The signature of
A09 0160 Harold V& Varani, former director of architecture and engineering
A09 0170 in the Department of Public Property, appeared on payment vouchers
A09 0180 certifying work on the project. Varani has been fired on charges of
A09 0190 accepting gifts from the contractor.   Managing Director Donald
A09 0200 C& Wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a
A09 0210 period of sharp disagreement on the matter}.   The announcement
A09 0220 that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made
A09 0230 by City Solicitor David Berger at a press conference following
A09 0240 a meeting in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the city
A09 0250 and the ~PTC as well as representatives of an engineering firm that
A09 0260 was pulled off the El project before its completion in 1959. #CONCERN
A09 0270 BANKRUPT# The Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries,
A09 0280 Inc&, both of 3646 N& 2d st&, filed for reorganization under
A09 0290 the Federal bankruptcy law. On Monday, the Hughes concern was formally
A09 0300 declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not
A09 0310 draw up a plan for reorganization.   Business relations between
A09 0320 the companies and city have been under investigation by Hemphill and
A09 0330 District Attorney James C& Crumlish, Jr&. #INTERVENES IN
A09 0340 CASE# The suit was filed later in the day in Common Pleas Court
A09 0350 7 against the Hughes company and two bonding firms. Travelers Indemnity
A09 0360 Co& and the Continental Casualty Co&.   At Berger's
A09 0370 direction, the city also intervened in the Hughes bankruptcy case
A09 0380 in U& S& District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim
A09 0390 there.   "I am taking the position that the contract was clearly
A09 0400 violated", Berger said.   The contract violations mostly
A09 0410 involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along
A09 0420 the El track. The contract called for overhauling of 102 joints.
A09 0430 The city paid for work on 75, of which no more than 21 were repaired,
A09 0440 Hemphill charged. #WIDE RANGE IN BIDS# Hemphill said the Hughes
A09 0450 concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each
A09 0460 joint. The bid from A& Belanger and Sons of Cambridge, Mass&,
A09 0470 which listed the same officers as Hughes, was $600 per joint.
A09 0480    But, Hemphill added, bids from other contractors ranged from $2400
A09 0490 to $3100 per joint.   Berger's decision to sue for the full
A09 0500 amount of the performance bond was questioned by Wagner in the morning
A09 0510 press conference. Wagner said the city paid only $37,500 to the Hughes
A09 0520 company. "We won't know the full amount until we get a full
A09 0530 report", Wagner said.   "We can claim on the maximum amount
A09 0540 of the bond", Berger said.   Wagner replied, "Can't you
A09 0550 just see the headline: 'City Hooked for $172,000'"? #'KNOW
A09 0560 ENOUGH TO SUE'# Berger insisted that "we know enough to
A09 0570 sue for the full amount".   Douglas M& Pratt, president of
A09 0580 the ~PTC, who attended the meeting, said the transit company is
A09 0590 reviewing the work on the El.   "We want to find out who knew
A09 0600 about it", Pratt said. "Certain people must have known about it".
A09 0610    "The ~PTC is investigating the whole matter", Pratt
A09 0620 said.
A09 0630    Samuel D& Goodis, representing the Philadelphia Hotel Association,
A09 0640 objected on Tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing
A09 0650 fees, saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged
A09 0660 from 48 to 74 percent last year.   Goodis voiced his objection before
A09 0670 City Council's Finance Committee.   For hotels with
A09 0680 1000 rooms, the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000
A09 0690 a year, Goodis said. #TESTIFIES AT HEARING# His testimony came
A09 0700 during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses,
A09 0710 permits and city services. The new fees are expected to raise an additional
A09 0720 $740,000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2,330,000 more a year
A09 0730 after that.   The ordinance would increase the fee for rooming
A09 0740 houses, hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room. The cost of a
A09 0750 license now is $2, with an annual renewal fee of $1.   Goodis said
A09 0760 that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some
A09 0770 hotels. #REVENUE ESTIMATED# The city expects the higher rooming
A09 0780 house, hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457,000
A09 0790 a year.   The increase also was opposed by Leonard Kaplan,
A09 0800 spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Philadelphia, on
A09 0810 behalf of association members who operate apartment houses.   A
A09 0820 proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from Councilwoman
A09 0830 Virginia Knauer, who formerly raised pedigreed dogs. The ordinance
A09 0840 would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat
A09 0850 $5 a dog. #COMMISSIONER REPLIES# Mrs& Knauer said she did not
A09 0860 think dog owners should be penalized for the city's services to animal
A09 0870 care.   In reply, Deputy Police Commissioner Howard R&
A09 0880 Leary said that the city spends more than $115,000 annually to license
A09 0890 and regulate dogs but collects only $43,000 in fees.   He reported
A09 0900 that the city's contributions for animal care included $67,000
A09 0910 to the Women's S&P&C&A&; $15,000 to pay six policemen
A09 0920 assigned as dog catchers and $15,000 to investigate dog bites. #BACKS
A09 0930 HIGHER FEES# City Finance Director Richard J& McConnell
A09 0940 indorsed the higher fees, which, he said, had been under study for more
A09 0950 than a year. The city is not adequately compensated for the services
A09 0960 covered by the fees, he said.   The new fee schedule also was
A09 0970 supported by Commissioner of Licenses and Inspections Barnet Lieberman
A09 0980 and Health Commissioner Eugene A& Gillis.
A09 0990    Petitions asking for a jail term for Norristown attorney Julian
A09 1000 W& Barnard will be presented to the Montgomery County Court
A09 1010 Friday, it was disclosed Tuesday by Horace A& Davenport, counsel
A09 1020 for the widow of the man killed last Nov& 1 by Barnard's hit-run
A09 1030 car.   The petitions will be presented in open court to President
A09 1040 Judge William F& Dannehower, Davenport said.   Barnard,
A09 1050 who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges, was
A09 1060 fined $500 by Judge Warren K& Hess, and placed on two years' probation
A09 1070 providing he does not drive during that time. He was caught
A09 1080 driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning.
A09 1090    Victim of the accident was Robert Lee Stansbery, 39. His
A09 1100 widow started the circulation of petitions after Barnard was reprimanded
A09 1110 for violating the probation.
A09 1120    The City Planning Commission on Tuesday approved agreements
A09 1130 between two redevelopers and the Redevelopment Authority for the purchase
A09 1140 of land in the $300,000,000 Eastwick Redevelopment Area project.
A09 1150    The commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate
A09 1160 traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project.   One of
A09 1170 the agreements calls for the New Eastwick Corp& to purchase a 1311
A09 1180 acre tract for $12,192,865. The tract is bounded by Island ave&,
A09 1190 Dicks ave&, 61st st&, and Eastwick ave&. #FOUR PARKS PLANNED#
A09 1200 It is designated as Stage 1 Residential on the Redevelopment
A09 1210 Authority's master plan and will feature row houses, garden apartments,
A09 1220 four small parks, schools, churches, a shopping center and several
A09 1230 small clusters of stores.   The corporation was formed by the
A09 1240 Reynolds Metal Co& and the Samuel A& and Henry A& Berger
A09 1250 firm, a Philadelphia builder, for work in the project.   The second
A09 1260 agreement permits the authority to sell a 520-acre tract west of
A09 1270 Stage 1 Residential to Philadelphia Builders Eastwick Corp&,
A09 1280 a firm composed of 10 Philadelphia area builders, which is interested
A09 1290 in developing part of the project. #WOULD BAR VEHICLES# The plan
A09 1300 for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by Dr&
A09 1310 Constantinos A& Doxiadis, former Minister of Reconstruction
A09 1320 in Greece and a consulting planner for the New Eastwick Corp&.
A09 1330    The plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would
A09 1340 be barred to vehicular traffic. It provides for a series of landscaped
A09 1350 walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through
A09 1360 the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length of the project.
A09 1370    The esplanade eliminates Grovers ave&, which on original
A09 1380 plans ran through the center of the development. The esplanade would
A09 1390 feature pedestrian bridges over roads in the project.
A09 1400 _KANSAS CITY, MO&, FEB& 9 (~UPI)_- The president of the
A09 1410 Kansas City local of the International Association of Fire Fighters
A09 1420 was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left
A09 1430 home for work.   Battalion Chief Stanton M& Gladden, 42,
A09 1440 the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters
A09 1450 association and the teamsters union, suffered multiple fractures
A09 1460 of both ankles. He was in Baptist Memorial hospital. #IGNITION SETS
A09 1470 OFF BLAST# The battalion chief said he had just gotten into his
A09 1480 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that
A09 1490 he could take his other car to work.   "I'd just turned on
A09 1500 the ignition when there was a big flash and I was lying on the driveway",
A09 1510 he said.   Gladden's wife and two of his sons, John,
A09 1520 17, and Jim, 13, were inside the house. The younger boy said the blast
A09 1530 knocked him out of bed and against the wall. #HOOD FLIES OVER HOUSE#
A09 1540 The explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of
A09 1550 the house. The left front wheel landed 100 feet away.   Police
A09 1560 laboratory technicians said the explosive device, containing either ~TNT
A09 1570 or nitroglycerine, was apparently placed under the left front
A09 1580 wheel. It was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car's starter.
A09 1590    Gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls
A09 1600 in recent months and reportedly received one last night.   The
A09 1610 fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving
A09 1620 top personnel and the fight
A09 1630 between the fire fighters association and the
A09 1640 teamsters union. #LED FIGHT ON TEAMSTERS# Gladden has been an
A09 1650 outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union's
A09 1660 battle against the teamsters, which began organizing city firemen
A09 1670 in 1959.   The fire fighters association here offered a $5,000 reward
A09 1680 for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible
A09 1690 for the bombing. A $500 reward was offered by the association's
A09 1700 local in Kansas City, Kas&.   The association said
A09 1710 it would post 24 hour guards at Gladden's home and at those of James
A09 1720 Mining and Eugene Shiflett. Mining is secretary-treasurer of the
A09 1730 local and Shiflett is a member of its executive committee. Both have
A09 1740 been active in the association.
A09 1750 _ANKARA, TURKEY, OCT& 24 (~AP)_- Turkish political leaders
A09 1760 bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national
A09 1770 front government with Gen& Cemal Gursel as president.
A09 1780 An agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive
A09 1790 elections on Oct& 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political
A09 1800 bargaining under the threat of an army coup d'etat.   By-passing
A09 1810 the military junta which has ruled Turkey since the overthrow
A09 1820 of Premier Adnan Menderes 17 months ago, the army general staff,
A09 1830 led by Gen& Cedvet Sunay, had set a deadline for the parties to
A09 1840 join in a national coalition government.   The army leaders threatened
A09 1850 to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign
A09 1860 an eight point protocol agreeing on Gen& Gursel as president. Gen&
A09 1870 Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months.
A09 1880 The military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes
A09 1890 in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the Menderes regime
A09 1900 now in prison would be pardoned.   Party leaders came out of
A09 1910 the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement
A09 1920 had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections
A09 1930 which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its
A09 1940 own.
A10 0010    Vincent G& Ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant
A10 0020 district attorney, it was announced Monday by Charles E& Raymond,
A10 0030 District Attorney.   Ierulli will replace Desmond D& Connall
A10 0040 who has been called to active military service but is expected back
A10 0050 on the job by March 31.   Ierulli, 29, has been practicing
A10 0060 in Portland since November, 1959. He is a graduate of Portland University
A10 0070 and the Northwestern College of Law. He is married and the
A10 0080 father of three children.
A10 0090    Helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure
A10 0100 is more important than aiding them economically, E& M& Martin,
A10 0110 assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the
A10 0120 World Affairs Council Monday night.   Martin, who has been
A10 0130 in office in Washington, D& C&, for 13 months spoke at the
A10 0140 council's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel. He told some 350
A10 0150 persons that the United States' challenge was to help countries build
A10 0160 their own societies their own ways, following their own paths.
A10 0170    "We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which, if not identical,
A10 0180 is congenial with ours", he said but adding that if they do
A10 0190 not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality
A10 0200 and loyalty. #PATIENCE NEEDED# Insuring that the countries
A10 0210 have a freedom of choice, he said, was the biggest detriment to the Soviet
A10 0220 Union.   He cited East Germany where after 15 years of
A10 0230 Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people
A10 0240 in, and added, "so long as people rebel, we must not give up".
A10 0250    Martin called for patience on the part of Americans.   "The
A10 0260 countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we
A10 0270 took a century to build", he said.   By leaving our doors open
A10 0280 the United States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and
A10 0290 to compare, he said. #INDIVIDUAL HELP BEST# "We have no reason
A10 0300 to fear failure, but we must be extraordinarily patient", the assistant
A10 0310 secretary said.   Economically, Martin said, the United
A10 0320 States could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves.
A10 0330 Private business is more effective than government aid, he explained,
A10 0340 because individuals are able to work with the people themselves.
A10 0350    The United States must plan to absorb the exported goods of
A10 0360 the country, at what he termed a "social cost".   Martin said
A10 0370 the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary
A10 0380 products which may involve the total income of one country.
A10 0390    The Portland school board was asked Monday to take a positive
A10 0400 stand towards developing and coordinating with Portland's civil defense
A10 0410 more plans for the city's schools in event of attack.
A10 0420 But there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board
A10 0430 should go, and whose advice it should follow.   The board members,
A10 0440 after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs& Ralph H&
A10 0450 Molvar, 1409 ~SW Maplecrest Dr&, said they thought they had already
A10 0460 been cooperating.   Chairman C& Richard Mears pointed
A10 0470 out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem, in case
A10 0480 of atomic attack, but that the board would cooperate so far as possible
A10 0490 to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go.
A10 0495    Dr& Melvin W& Barnes,
A10 0500 superintendent, said he thought the schools
A10 0510 were waiting for some leadership, perhaps on the national level,
A10 0520 to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would "be more
A10 0530 fruitful", and that he had found that other school districts were
A10 0540 not as far along in their planning as this district.   "Los Angeles
A10 0550 has said they would send the children to their homes in case of
A10 0560 disaster", he said. "Nobody really expects to evacuate. I think
A10 0570 everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national
A10 0580 level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence
A10 0590 in following.   Mrs& Molvar, who kept reiterating her request
A10 0600 that they "please take a stand", said, "We must have faith
A10 0610 in somebody- on the local level, and it wouldn't be possible for
A10 0620 everyone to rush to a school to get their children".   Dr&
A10 0630 Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans, even
A10 0640 for a high school where there were lots of cars "might not be realistic
A10 0650 and would not work".   Mrs& Molvar asked again that
A10 0660 the board join in taking a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe's program.
A10 0670 The board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far
A10 0680 and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting.
A10 0690    It was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board
A10 0700 should be informed on what was done, is going to be done and what
A10 0710 it thought should be done.
A10 0720 _SALEM (~AP)_- The statewide meeting of war mothers Tuesday
A10 0730 in Salem will hear a greeting from Gov& Mark Hatfield.   Hatfield
A10 0740 also is scheduled to hold a public United Nations Day reception
A10 0750 in the state capitol on Tuesday.   His schedule calls for
A10 0760 a noon speech Monday in Eugene at the Emerald Empire Kiwanis Club.
A10 0770    He will speak to Willamette University Young Republicans
A10 0780 Thursday night in Salem.   On Friday he will go to Portland
A10 0790 for the swearing in of Dean Bryson as Multnomah County Circuit
A10 0800 Judge.   He will attend a meeting of the Republican State Central
A10 0810 Committee Saturday in Portland and see the Washington-Oregon
A10 0820 football game.
A10 0830    Beaverton School District No& 48 board members examined blueprints
A10 0840 and specifications for two proposed junior high schools at a
A10 0850 Monday night workshop session.   A bond issue which would have
A10 0860 provided some $3.5 million for construction of the two 900-student schools
A10 0870 was defeated by district voters in January.   Last week the
A10 0880 board, by a 4
A10 0890 to 3 vote, decided to ask voters whether they prefer the
A10 0900 6-3-3 (junior high school) system or the 8-4 system. Board members
A10 0910 indicated Monday night this would be done by an advisory poll to be
A10 0920 taken on Nov& 15, the same date as a $581,000 bond election for the
A10 0930 construction of three new elementary schools.
A10 0940    Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg will speak Sunday night
A10 0950 at the Masonic Temple at a $25-a-plate dinner honoring Sen& Wayne
A10 0960 L& Morse, ~D-Ore&.   The dinner is sponsored by organized
A10 0970 labor and is scheduled for 7 p&m&.   Secretary Goldberg
A10 0980 and Sen& Morse will hold a joint press conference at the Roosevelt
A10 0990 Hotel at 4:30 p&m& Sunday, Blaine Whipple, executive secretary
A10 1000 of the Democratic Party of Oregon, reported Tuesday.
A10 1010    Other speakers for the fund-raising dinner include Reps& Edith
A10 1020 Green and Al Ullman, Labor Commissioner Norman Nilsen and Mayor
A10 1030 Terry Schrunk, all Democrats.
A10 1040 _OAK GROVE (SPECIAL)_- Three positions on the Oak Lodge
A10 1050 Water
A10 1060 district board of directors have attracted 11 candidates. The election
A10 1070 will be Dec& 4 from 8 a&m& to 8 p&m&. Polls will be in
A10 1080 the water office.   Incumbent Richard Salter seeks re-election
A10 1090 and is opposed by Donald Huffman for the five-year term. Incumbent
A10 1100 William Brod is opposed in his re-election bid by Barbara Njust,
A10 1110 Miles C& Bubenik and Frank Lee.   Five candidates seek the
A10 1120 place vacated by Secretary Hugh G& Stout. Seeking this two-year
A10 1130 term are James Culbertson, Dwight M& Steeves, James C& Piersee,
A10 1140 W&M& Sexton and Theodore W& Heitschmidt.
A10 1150    A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their
A10 1160 future were taken Friday by delegates to the 29th general council of
A10 1170 the Assemblies of God, in session at the Memorial Coliseum.
A10 1180 The council revised, in an effort to strengthen, the denomination's
A10 1190 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966.   The changes, unanimously adopted,
A10 1200 were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the
A10 1210 Bible. The council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in
A10 1220 and dependence on the Bible.   At the adoption, the Rev& T&
A10 1230 F& Zimmerman, general superintendent, commented, "The Assemblies
A10 1240 of God has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days
A10 1250 and has, without compromise, stood for the great truths of the Bible
A10 1260 for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives".
A10 1270 #NEW POINT ADDED# Many changes involved minor editing and clarification;
A10 1280 however, the first belief stood for entire revision with a
A10 1290 new third point added to the list.   The first of 16 beliefs of
A10 1300 the denomination, now reads:   "The scriptures, both Old and
A10 1310 New Testament, are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation
A10 1320 of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct".
A10 1330    The third belief, in six points, emphasizes the Diety
A10 1340 of the Lord Jesus Christ, and:  - emphasizes the Virgin
A10 1350 birth  - the sinless life of Christ  - His miracles
A10 1360   - His substitutionary work on the cross  - His bodily
A10 1370 resurrection from the dead  - and His exaltation to the right
A10 1380 hand of God. #SUPER AGAIN ELECTED# Friday afternoon the Rev&
A10 1390 T& F& Zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two-year
A10 1400 term as general superintendent of Assemblies of God. His offices
A10 1410 are in Springfield, Mo&. Election came on the nominating ballot.
A10 1420    Friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming
A10 1430 program, "Breakthrough" scheduled to fill the churches for the
A10 1440 next two years. In his opening address Wednesday the Rev& Mr&
A10 1450 Zimmerman, urged the delegates to consider a 10-year expansion program,
A10 1460 with "Breakthrough" the theme for the first two years.
A10 1470 The Rev& R& L& Brandt, national secretary of the home missions
A10 1480 department, stressed the need for the first two years' work.
A10 1490    "Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact
A10 1500 with the church. This means that more than 100 million have no vital
A10 1510 touch with the church or religious life", he told delegates Friday.
A10 1520 #CHURCH LOSES PACE# Talking of the rapid population growth (upwards
A10 1530 of 12,000 babies born daily) with an immigrant entering the United
A10 1540 States every 1-1/2 minutes, he said "our organization has not
A10 1550 been keeping pace with this challenge".   "In 35 years we have
A10 1560 opened 7,000 churches", the Rev& Mr& Brandt said, adding that
A10 1570 the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10,000
A10 1580 persons.   "In this light we need 1,000 churches in Illinois,
A10 1590 where we have 200; 800 in Southern New England, we have 60;
A10 1600 we need 100 in Rhode Island, we have none", he said.   To step
A10 1610 up the denomination's program, the Rev& Mr& Brandt suggested
A10 1620 the vision of 8,000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10
A10 1630 years.   To accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods,
A10 1640 he said. #'CHURCH MEETS CHANGE'# "The church's
A10 1650 ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet
A10 1660 the challenge of this hour".   A capsule view of proposed plans
A10 1670 includes:  - Encouraging by every means, all existing Assemblies
A10 1680 of God churches to start new churches.  - Engaging
A10 1690 mature, experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population
A10 1700 centers.  - Surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational
A10 1710 volunteers (laymen, who will be urged to move into the area of new
A10 1720 churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project).
A10 1730   - Arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 6-12 months
A10 1740 as apprentices in well-established churches.
A10 1750    U&S& Dist& Judge Charles L& Powell denied all motions
A10 1760 made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland's insurance fraud
A10 1770 trial.   Denials were of motions of dismissal, continuance, mistrial,
A10 1780 separate trial, acquittal, striking of testimony and directed
A10 1790 verdict.   In denying motions for dismissal, Judge Powell stated
A10 1800 that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that
A10 1810 "a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators
A10 1820 are".   Attorney Dwight L& Schwab, in behalf of
A10 1830 defendant Philip Weinstein, argued there is no evidence linking Weinstein
A10 1840 to the conspiracy, but Judge Powell declared this is a matter
A10 1850 for the jury to decide. #PROOF LACK CHARGED# Schwab also declared
A10 1860 there is no proof of Weinstein's entering a conspiracy to use the
A10 1870 U&S& mails to defraud, to which federal prosecutor A& Lawrence
A10 1880 Burbank replied:   "It is not necessary that a defendant
A10 1890 actually have conpired to use the U&S& mails to defraud as long
A10 1900 as there is evidence of a conspiracy, and the mails were then used
A10 1910 to carry it out".   In the afternoon, defense attorneys began
A10 1920 the presentation of their cases with opening statements, some of which
A10 1930 had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and
A10 1940 presented its case.
A11 0010 _MIAMI, FLA&, MARCH 17_- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction
A11 0020 of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League
A11 0030 clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision,
A11 0040 this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3.
A11 0050    Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds
A11 0060 were to end their victory draought as they coasted along with a 3-to-o
A11 0070 advantage.
A11 0080 #SIEBERN HITS HOMER# Over the first five frames, Jack
A11 0090 Fisher, the big righthandler who figures to be in the middle of
A11 0100 Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant, held
A11 0110 the ~A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits.   Then
A11 0120 Dick Hyde, submarine-ball hurler, entered the contest and only
A11 0130 five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock.
A11 0140    A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill
A11 0150 Tuttle tied the game, and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the
A11 0160 Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts. #HOUSE THROWS WILD#
A11 0170 With one down in the eighth, Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole
A11 0180 second as Hyde fanned Tuttle. Catcher Frank House's throw
A11 0190 in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt.   Then
A11 0200 Heywood Sullivan, Kansas City catcher, singled up the middle and
A11 0210 Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run.
A11 0220    Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of
A11 0230 the ninth and gave up the ~A's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman
A11 0240 Dick Howser, a wild pitch, and Frank Cipriani's single under
A11 0250 Shortstop Jerry Adair's glove into center.   The Orioles
A11 0260 once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion, gathering
A11 0270 only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers. Three
A11 0280 were doubles, Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding
A11 0290 one. #HARTMAN IMPRESSIVE# Bill Kunkel, Bob Hartman and Ed
A11 0300 Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach
A11 0310 to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium.
A11 0320    The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before
A11 0330 Hartman took over in the top of the fourth. Hartman, purchased
A11 0340 by the ~A's from the Milwaukee Braves last fall, allowed no hits
A11 0350 in his scoreless three-inning appearance, and merited the triumph.
A11 0360    Keegan, a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder, gave up the Orioles' last
A11 0370 two safeties over the final three frames, escaping a load of trouble
A11 0380 in the ninth when the Birds threatened but
A11 0390 failed to tally. #ROBINSON
A11 0400 DOUBLES AGAIN# In the ninth, Robinson led off with his second
A11 0410 double of the night, a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left.
A11 0420    Whitey Herzog, performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly
A11 0430 their strongest team of the spring, worked Keegan for a base on
A11 0440 balls.   Then three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to produce.
A11 0450    Pete Ward was sent in for House and, after failing in a bunt
A11 0460 attempt, popped to Howser on the grass back of short.   John
A11 0470 Powell, batting for Adair, fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches,
A11 0480 and Buddy Barker, up for Stepanovich, bounced out sharply to
A11 0490 Jerry Lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest.
A11 0500    The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding, along with
A11 0510 Robinson, the two Birds who got a pair of hits, doubled to right
A11 0520 center, moved to third on Russ Snyder's single to right and crossed
A11 0530 on Kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate.
A11 0540    The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits
A11 0550 after two were out.   Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole
A11 0560 at short to start the rally. #LUMPE ERRS# Jim Gentile bounced
A11 0570 a hard shot off Kunkel's glove and beat it out for a single, and
A11 0580 when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry's
A11 0590 head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error.
A11 0600    Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both
A11 0610 runners. When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple, he
A11 0620 was cut down in a close play at third, Tuttle to Andy Carey.
A11 0630 The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring in the sixth went
A11 0640 like this:   Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde
A11 0650 and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde's next toss 415 feet
A11 0660 over the scoreboard in right center. #CAREY SINGLES# Carey singled
A11 0670 on a slow-bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut across to field
A11 0680 and threw wide to first. It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit.
A11 0690    Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play. Breeding
A11 0700 to Adair to Gentile, setting up Tuttle's 390-foot homer over the
A11 0710 wall in left center.   If the Orioles are to break their losing
A11 0720 streak within the next two days, it will have to be at the expense
A11 0730 of the American League champion New York Yankees, who come in here
A11 0740 tomorrow for a night game and a single test Sunday afternoon.
A11 0750 _MIAMI, FLA&, MARCH 17_- The flavor of Baltimore's Florida
A11 0760 Grapefruit League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles
A11 0770 were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under
A11 0780 the Army's military training program and is ready for belated
A11 0790 spring training.   Hansen, who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of
A11 0800 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a .255 freshman average, completes the
A11 0810 Birds' spring squad at 49 players.   The big, 22-year-old
A11 0820 shortstop, the 1960 American league "rookie-of-the year", flew here
A11 0830 late this afternoon from Baltimore, signed his contract for an estimated
A11 0840 $15,000 and was a spectator at tonight's 5-to-3 loss to Kansas
A11 0850 City- the winless Birds' sixth setback in a row. #15 POUNDS
A11 0860 LIGHTER# The 6-foot 3 inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds,
A11 0870 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring. He hopes
A11 0880 to melt off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks camp three
A11 0890 weeks hence.   When he was inducted into the Army at Fort
A11 0900 Knox, Ky&, Hansen's weight had dropped to 180- "too light
A11 0910 for me to be at my best" he said.   "I feel good physically",
A11 0920 Hansen added, "but I think I'll move better carrying a little
A11 0930 less weight than I'm carrying now". #SEEKS "IMPROVED FIELDING"#
A11 0940 The rangy, Albany (Cal&) native, a surprise slugging
A11 0950 sensation for the Flock last year as well as a defensive whiz, set
A11 0960 "improved fielding" as his 1961 goal.
A11 0970    "I think I can do a better job with the glove, now that I
A11 0980 know the hitters around the league a little better", he said.
A11 0990    Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami Stadium prior to
A11 1000 the opening tomorrow night of a two-game weekend series with the New
A11 1010 York Yankees.   Skinny Brown and Hoyt Wilhelm, the Flock's
A11 1020 veteran knuckleball specialists, are slated to oppose the American
A11 1030 League champions in tomorrow's 8 P&M& contest. #DUREN, SHELDON
A11 1040 ON HILL# Ryne Duren and Roland Sheldon, a rookie righthander
A11 1050 who posted a 15-1 record last year for the Yanks' Auburn (N&Y&)
A11 1060 farm club of the Class-~D New York-Pennsylvania League,
A11 1070 are the probable rival pitchers.   Twenty-one-year-old Milt Pappas
A11 1080 and Jerry Walker, 22, are scheduled to share the Oriole mound
A11 1090 chores against the Bombers' Art Ditmar in Sunday's 2 P&M&
A11 1100 encounter.   Ralph Houk, successor to Casey Stengel at the
A11 1110 Yankee helm, plans to bring the entire New York squad here from
A11 1120 St& Petersburg, including Joe Dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated
A11 1130 for both weekend games. The famed Yankee Clipper, now retired,
A11 1140 has been assisting as a batting coach. #SQUAD CUT NEAR# Pitcher
A11 1150 Steve Barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch
A11 1160 under the Army's accelerated wintertime military course, also at
A11 1170 Fort Knox, Ky&. The 22-year-old southpaw enlisted earlier last

A11 1220 Hansen as the Bird third sacker grabbed a bat, headed for the plate
A11 1230 and bounced a third-inning two-run double off the left-centerfield
A11 1240 wall tonight.   It was the first of two doubles by Robinson,
A11 1250 who was in a mood to celebrate.   Just before game time, Robinson's
A11 1260 pretty wife, Connie informed him that an addition to the family
A11 1270 can be expected late next summer.   Unfortunately, Brooks'
A11 1280 teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before

A11 1590 _CLEVELAND, MARCH 17 (~AP)_- George Kerr, the swift-striding
A11 1610 Jamaican, set a meet record in the 600-yard run in the Knights of Columbus
A11 1620 track meet tonight, beating Purdue's Dave Mills in a hot
A11 1630 duel in 1.10.1.   Kerr, who set the world record earlier this month
A11 1640 in New York with a clocking of 1.09.3, wiped out Mills's early
A11 1650 pace and beat the young Big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards. Both
A11 1660 were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal Whitfield.
A11 1670    Mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of
A11 1680 the race. Then Kerr, a graduate student from Illinois, moved past
A11 1690 him on a straightaway and held off Mills's challenge on the final turn.
A11 1700 Mills was timed in 1.10.4.   The crowd at the twenty-first
A11 1710 annual K& of C& Games, final indoor meet of the season, got a
A11 1720 thrill a few minutes earlier when a slender, bespectacled woman broke

A11 1870 today.
A12 0010 _AUSTIN, TEXAS_- A Texas halfback who doesn't even know the
A12 0020 team's plays, Eldon Moritz, ranks fourth in Southwest Conference
A12 0030 scoring after three games.   Time stands still every time Moritz,
A12 0040 a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran, goes into the field. Although
A12 0050 he never gets to play while the clock is running, he gets a big
A12 0060 kick- several every Saturday, in fact- out of football.
A12 0070 Moritz doesn't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of
A12 0080 the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily
A12 0090 favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl.   That's
A12 0100 because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries. He ran
A12 0110 his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before
A12 0120 one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington
A12 0130 State.   Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right
A12 0140 halfback, the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team. But
A12 0150 ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you'll get the
A12 0160 quick response, "place-kicker".   A 208-pound, 6-foot 1-inch
A12 0170 senior from Stamford, Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking. Last
A12 0180 year, when he worked out at halfback all season, he didn't get
A12 0190 into a single game.   "This year, coach Royal told me if I'd
A12 0200 work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me", said Moritz.
A12 0210 "So I started practicing on it in spring training.   Moritz
A12 0220 was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle
A12 0230 in the thigh of his right (kicking) leg and, as a result, several of
A12 0240 his successful conversions have gone barely far enough.   Moritz
A12 0250 said Monday his leg feels fine and, as a result, he hopes to start
A12 0260 practicing field goals this week. He kicked several while playing at
A12 0270 Stamford High School, including one that beat Anson, 3-0, in a 1953
A12 0280 district game.   "I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries
A12 0290 during three years in high school", he said, "and made 26 in a
A12 0300 row at one time. I never did miss one in a playoff game- I kicked
A12 0310 about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years".   Moritz
A12 0320 came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered
A12 0330 by a knee injury. He missed the 1955 season because of an operation
A12 0335 on
A12 0340 the ailing knee, then played 77 minutes in 1956. His statistical record
A12 0350 that year, when Texas won only one game and lost nine, was far from
A12 0360 impressive: he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10
A12 0370 yards, punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards.
A12 0380    He went into the Army in March, 1957, and returned two years later.
A12 0390 But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present
A12 0400 last season.   Place kicking is largely a matter of timing, Moritz
A12 0410 declared.   "Once you get the feel of it, there's not much
A12 0420 to it. I've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some
A12 0430 of them can't seem to get the feel. Practice helps you to get your
A12 0440 timing down.   "It's kind of like golf- if you don't
A12 0450 swing a club very often, your timing gets off".   Moritz, however,
A12 0460 kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session.
A12 0470    "If you kick too much, your leg gets kinda dead", he
A12 0480 explained. @ _FOOTNOTES:_ In their first three games, the Longhorns
A12 0490 have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times, or 40 per cent
A12 0500 **h their total passing yardage in three games, 447 on 30 completions
A12 0510 in 56 attempts, is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage
A12 0520 in 1959, when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries **h. Tailback
A12 0530 James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant
A12 0540 sophomore season, when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries; he
A12 0550 now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games **h. Saxton has made
A12 0560 only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the Washington
A12 0570 State game, for four plays: he returned the kickoff 30 yards,
A12 0580 gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown
A12 0590 run before retiring to the bench **h. Wingback Jack Collins injured
A12 0600 a knee in the Washington State game but insists he'll be ready
A12 0610 for Oklahoma **h. Last week, when Royal was informed that three
A12 0620 Longhorns were among the conference's top four in rushing, he said:
A12 0630 "That won't last long". It didn't; Monday, he had four
A12 0640 Longhorns in the top four **h.
A12 0650    A good feeling prevailed on the ~SMU coaching staff Monday,
A12 0660 but attention quickly turned from Saturday's victory to next week's
A12 0670 problem: Rice University. The Mustangs don't play this
A12 0680 week.   "We're just real happy for the players", Coach Bill
A12 0690 Meek said of the 9-7 victory over the Air Force Academy. "I
A12 0700 think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight
A12 0710 week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on. It was
A12 0720 the first time we've been ahead this season (when John Richey kicked
A12 0730 what proved to be the winning field goal)".   Assistant coach
A12 0740 John Cudmore described victory as "a good feeling, I think, on
A12 0750 the part of the coaches and the players. We needed it and we got it".
A12 0760    Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive
A12 0770 performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy Gannon. Both
A12 0780 turned in top jobs for the second straight game.   "Nelson played
A12 0790 magnificent football", Meek praised. "He knocked down the interference
A12 0800 and made key stops lots of times. And he caused the fumble
A12 0810 that set up our touchdown. He broke that boy (Air Force fullback Nick
A12 0820 Arshinkoff) in two and knocked him loose from the football".
A12 0830    Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons' aerial thrusts
A12 0840 in the late stages.   One was on a fourth-down screen pass from
A12 0850 the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon's territory.
A12 0860    "As soon as it started to form, Gannon spotted it", Meek
A12 0870 said. "He timed it just right and broke through there before the
A12 0880 boy (halfback Terry Isaacson) had time to turn around. He really crucified
A12 0890 him **h he nailed it for a yard loss".   The Air Force's,
A12 0900 and the game's, final play, was a long pass by quarterback
A12 0910 Bob McNaughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned
A12 0920 22 yards.   "He just lay back there and waited for it", Meek
A12 0930 said. "He almost brought it back all the way".   Except
A12 0940 for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback Mike Rice, Meek expects
A12 0950 the squad to be physically sound for Rice.   "Kelsey is
A12 0960 very doubtful for the Rice game", Meek said. "He'll be out of
A12 0970 action all this week. He got hit from the blind side by the split end
A12 0980 coming back on the second play of the game. There is definitely some
A12 0990 ligament damage in his knee".   Rice has not played since injuring
A12 1000 a knee in the opener with Maryland.   "He's looking
A12 1010 a lot better, and he's able to run", Meek explained. "We'll
A12 1020 let him do a lot of running this week, but I don't know if he'll
A12 1030 be able to play".   The game players saw the Air Force film
A12 1040 Monday, ran for 30 minutes, then went in, while the reserves scrimmaged
A12 1050 for 45 minutes.   "We'll work hard Tuesday, Wednesday
A12 1060 and Thursday", Meek said, "and probably will have a good scrimmage
A12 1070 Friday. We'll work out about an hour on Saturday, then we'll
A12 1080 work Monday and Tuesday of next week, then taper off".   ~SMU

A12 1260    The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory
A12 1270 in four American Football League starts- a 19-12 triumph over
A12 1280 the Denver Broncos- but their visit will be a short one.
A12 1290 The Texans have two more road games- at Buffalo and Houston-
A12 1300 before they play for the home folks again, and it looks as if coach Hank
A12 1310 Stram's men will meet the Bills just as they are developing into
A12 1320 the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings.
A12 1330    Buffalo coach Buster Ramsey, who has become one of the game's
A12 1340 greatest collectors of quarterbacks, apparently now has found a productive
A12 1350 pair in two ex-National Football Leaguers, M& C& Reynolds
A12 1360 and Warren Rabb.   Rabb, the former Louisiana State
A12 1370 field general, came off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday
A12 1380 and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory over the Houston
A12 1390 Oilers, defending league champions.   "Just our luck"! exclaimed
A12 1400 Stram. "Buster would solve that quarterback problem just
A12 1410 as we head that way".   Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about
A12 1420 himself, for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid
A12 1430 effort against Denver, and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous
A12 1440 Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star, Jack Spikes, though
A12 1450 he did the team's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury.
A12 1460    "Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well",
A12 1470 said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the
A12 1480 game. "In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job".
A12 1490 The Texans won the game through ball control, with Quarterback Cotton
A12 1500 Davidson throwing only 17 passes.   "We always like to keep
A12 1510 the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an
A12 1520 explosive attack", explained Stram. "They can be going along,
A12 1530 doing little damage, then bang, bang- they can hit a couple of passes
A12 1540 on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble".   The Broncs
A12 1550 did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans, but
A12 1560 Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off.   The principal
A12 1570 tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner Haynes, the flashy
A12 1580 halfback. He was called upon 26 times- more than all of the other
A12 1590 ball-carriers combined- and delivered 145 yards.   The Texans
A12 1600 made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver's
A12 1610 Al Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson,
A12 1620 the speedy halfback, hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed
A12 1630 it for Dallas. A quick touchdown resulted.   "That permitted
A12 1640 us to start controlling the ball right away", said Stram, quipping,
A12 1650 "I think I'll put that play in the book".
A12 1660    The early Southwest Conference football leaders- Texas, Arkansas
A12 1670 and Texas ~A+~M- made a big dent in the statistics last
A12 1680 week.   Texas' 545-yard spree against Washington State gave
A12 1690 the Longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1,512 yards (1,065 rushing
A12 1700 and 447 passing) a new ~SWC high.   Arkansas combined 280
A12 1710 yards rushing with 64 yards passing (on 5 completions in 7 tosses) and
A12 1720 a tough defense to whip ~TCU, and ~A+~M, with a 38-point
A12 1730 bulge against Texas Tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950.
A12 1740 Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards, the Aggies had a total
A12 1750 offense of 361 yards.   Texas leads in per-game rushing averages,
A12 1760 355 yards, and passing 149 (to Baylor's 126), but idle Baylor has
A12 1770 the best defensive record (187.5 yards per game to Texas' 189).
A12 1780 ~A+~M has the best defense against passes, 34.7 yards per game.
A12 1790    Not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness
A12 1800 of baseballs currently in use, the major leagues have ordered their own
A12 1810 tests, which are in progress at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
A13 0010    {Rookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday
A13 0020 night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis, 5-3}.
A13 0030    The husky 6-3, 205-pound lefthander, was in command all the
A13 0040 way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television
A13 0050 viewers in the Denver area.   It was Nischwitz' third
A13 0060 straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies' winning
A13 0070 streak to four straight. They now lead Louisville by a full game on
A13 0080 top of the American Association pack.   {Nischwitz fanned six
A13 0090 and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning. He has given
A13 0100 only the one pass in his 27 innings, an unusual characteristic for a
A13 0110 southpaw}.   The Bears took the lead in the first inning, as
A13 0120 they did in Sunday's opener, and never lagged.   Dick McAuliffe
A13 0130 cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don Rudolph
A13 0140 to open the Bear's attack. After Al Paschal gruonded out, Jay
A13 0150 Cooke walked and Jim McDaniel singled home McAuliffe. Alusik then
A13 0160 moved Cooke across with a line drive to left. Jay Porter drew a
A13 0170 base on balls to fill the bases but Don Wert's smash was knocked
A13 0180 down by Rudolph for the putout.   The Bears added two more in
A13 0190 the fifth when McAuliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner,
A13 0200 Paschal doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled off Phil
A13 0210 Shartzer's glove.   {Nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter
A13 0220 when the Indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the
A13 0230 sixth. Chuck Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner, Cliff Cook
A13 0240 and Dan Pavletich singled and Gaines' infielder roller accounted
A13 0245 for
A13 0250 the tallies}.   The Bears added their last run in the sixth
A13 0260 on Alusik's double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert.
A13 0270    Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third Indianapolis
A13 0280 run in the ninth.   Despite the 45-degree weather the game
A13 0290 was clicked off in 1:48, thanks to only three bases on balls and some
A13 0300 good infield play.   Chico Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik's
A13 0310 grounder in the hole in the fourth and Wert came up with some
A13 0320 good stops and showed a strong arm at third base. #BINGLES AND BOBBLES:#

A13 0490 line double, which just eluded the diving Minnie Minoso in left
A13 0500 field, drove in Jim Lemon with the winning run with two out in the
A13 0510 last of the ninth to give the Minnesota Twins a 6-5 victory over the
A13 0520 Chicago White Sox Monday}.   Lemon was on with his fourth
A13 0530 single of the game, a liner to center. He came all the way around on
A13 0540 Gardner's hit before 5777 fans. It was Gardner's second run batted
A13 0550 in of the game and his only ones of the year.   Turk Lown
A13 0560 was tagged with the loss, his second against no victories, while Ray
A13 0570 Moore won his second game against a single loss.   The Twins tied
A13 0580 the score in the sixth inning when Reno Bertoia beat out a high
A13 0590 chopper to third base and scored on Lenny Green's double to left.
A13 0600    The White Sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of the sixth on
A13 0610 a pair of pop fly hits- a triple by Roy Sievers and single by Camilo
A13 0620 Carreon- a walk and a sacrifice fly.   Jim Landis' 380-foot
A13 0630 home run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1-0 lead,
A13 0640 but Harmon Killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his
A13 0650 second homer in two days with the walking Bob Allison aboard.
A13 0660    Al Smith's 340-blast over left in the fourth- his fourth homer
A13 0670 of the campaign- tied the score and Carreon's first major league
A13 0680 home run in the fifth put the Sox back in front.   A double by
A13 0690 Green, Allison's run-scoring 2-baser, an infield single by Lemon
A13 0700 and Gardner's solid single to center put the Twins back in front
A13 0710 in the last of the fifth.
A13 0720 _OGDEN, UTAH, MAY 1- (~AP)_- Boston Red Sox Outfielder
A13 0740 Jackie Jensen said Monday night he was through playing baseball.
A13 0750    "I've had it", he told a newsman. "I know when my reflexes
A13 0760 are gone and I'm not going to be any 25th man on the ball club".
A13 0770    This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout.
A13 0780    Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a .130 batting average
A13 0790 in the first 12 games.   He took a midnight train out of Cleveland
A13 0800 Saturday, without an official word to anybody, and has stayed
A13 0810 away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to Reno, Nev&,
A13 0820 where his wife, former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe Ann Olsen,
A13 0830 awaited.   She said, when she learned Jackie was heading home:
A13 0840 "I'm just speculating, but I have to think Jack feels he's
A13 0850 hurting Boston's chances".   The Union Pacific Railroad
A13 0860 streamliner, City of San Francisco, stopped in Ogden, Utah, for
A13 0870 a few minutes. Sports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard
A13 0880 Examiner went to his compartment to talk with him.   The conductor
A13 0890 said to Ritchie: "I don't think you want to talk to him.
A13 0900 You'll probably get a ball bat on the head. He's mad at the
A13 0910 world".   But Jackie had gone into the station. Ritchie walked
A13 0920 up to him at the magazine stand.   "I told him who I was and
A13 0930 he was quite cold. But he warmed up after a while. I told him what
A13 0940 Liston had said and he said Liston was a double-crosser and said anything
A13 0950 he (Liston) got was through a keyhole. He said he had never
A13 0960 talked to Liston".   Liston is Bill Liston, baseball writer
A13 0970 for the Boston Traveler, who quoted Jensen as saying:
A13 0980 "I
A13 0990 can't hit anymore. I can't run. I can't throw. Suddenly my
A13 1000 reflexes are gone.
A13 1010    {JUST WHEN IT SEEMS baseball might be losing its grip on
A13 1020 the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging}.
A13 1030    And so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old Warren
A13 1040 Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants'
A13 1050 Willie Mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree
A13 1060 Sunday.   Both, of course, were remarkable feats and further embossed
A13 1070 the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime.
A13 1080    Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn's hitless pitching
A13 1090 probably reached the most hearts.   It was a real stimulant
A13 1100 to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone.
A13 1110 And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked, "Wish
A13 1120 I was 40, and a top-grade big leaguer. #@# {THE MODEST
A13 1130 AND
A13 1140 HAPPY} Spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days.
A13 1150 But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging
A13 1160 with the all-time great lefthanders in the game's history.
A13 1170    Yes, with Bob Grove, Carl Hubbell, Herb Pennock, Art Nehf,
A13 1180 Vernon Gomez, et al.   {Spahn not only is a superior pitcher
A13 1190 but a gentlemanly fine fellow, a ball player's ball player, as they
A13 1200 say in the trade}.   I remember his beardown performance in
A13 1210 a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct& 14, 1951, before
A13 1220 a new record crowd for the period of 18,792. #@# {"SPAHNIE
A13 1240 DOESN'T KNOW} how to merely go through the motions", remarked
A13 1250 Enos Slaughter, another all-out guy, who played rightfield that
A13 1260 day and popped one over the clubhouse.   The spectacular Mays,
A13 1270 who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25, joined six other
A13 1280 sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings.
A13 1290    {Incidentally, only two did it before a home audience. Bobby Lowe
A13 1300 of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil Hodges turned
A13 1310 the trick in Brooklyn's Ebbetts Field}.   Ed Delahanty
A13 1320 and Chuck Klein of the Phillies, the Braves' Joe Adcock, Lou
A13 1330 Gehrig of the Yankees, Pat Seerey of the White Sox and Rocky
A13 1340 Colavito, then with Cleveland, made their history on the road. #@#
A13 1350 {WILLIE'S BIG DAY REVIVED} the running argument about
A13 1360 the
A13 1370 relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle.   This is an issue
A13 1380 which boils down to a matter of opinion, depending on whether you're
A13 1390 an American or National fan and anti or pro-Yankee. The record
A13 1400 books, however, would favor the Giants' ace.   In four of his
A13 1410 nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as
A13 1420 many as 25 bases. Once the figure was 30-30. Willie's lifetime batting
A13 1430 average of .318 is 11 points beyond Mickey's.   {The
A13 1440 Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick
A13 1450 Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee's park. It will forever
A13 1460 be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after
A13 1470 a distressing slump}. #@# {THE DENVER-AREA ~TV}
A13 1480 audience was privileged to see Mays' four home runs, thanks to a
A13 1490 new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked
A13 1500 out when his Bears are playing at home.   This rule providing
A13 1510 for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of
A13 1520 a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game's top
A13 1530 rulers.   {The last couple of years the Bears management got
A13 1540 the business from the "Living Room Athletic Club" when games
A13 1550 were cut off. Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide
A13 1560 policy}.   This year, I am told, the ~CBS network
A13 1570 will continue to abide by the rule but ~NBC will play to a conclusion
A13 1580 here. There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation
A13 1590 will arise.   It is an irritable rule that does baseball more
A13 1600 harm than good, especially at the minor league level. You would be surprised
A13 1610 how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium last
A13 1620 year because of the television policy.   This dissatisfaction led
A13 1630 to Howsam's request that the video not be terminated before the end
A13 1640 of the game.
A13 1650 _CINCINNATI, OHIO (~AP)_- The powerful New York Yankees
A13 1660 won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed Cincinnati,
A13 1670 crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage Monday in the loosely
A13 1680 played finale.   With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both
A13 1690 out of action due to injuries, the American League champs still mounted
A13 1700 a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers,
A13 1710 the most ever used by one team in a series game.   Johnny Blanchard,
A13 1720 Mantle's replacement, slammed a 2-run homer as the Yankees routed
A13 1730 loser Joey Jay in a 5-run first inning. Hector Lopez, subbing
A13 1740 for Berra, smashed a 3-run homer off Bill Henry during another 5-run
A13 1750 explosion in the fourth.   The Yanks also took advantage of
A13 1760 three Cincinnati errors.   The crowd of 32,589 had only two chances
A13 1770 to applaud.   In the third Frank Robinson hammered a long
A13 1780 home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center, about
A13 1790 400 feet away, with two men on. Momentarily the Reds were back in
A13 1800 the ball game, trailing only 6-3, but the drive fizzled when John Edwards
A13 1810 fouled out with men on second and third and two out.   In
A13 1820 the fifth, Wally Post slashed a 2-run homer off Bud Daley, but by
A13 1830 that time the score was 11-5 and it really didn't matter.   The
A13 1840 Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third man to lead a team
A13 1850 to both a pennant and a World Series victory in his first year as a
A13 1860 manager. Only Bucky Harris, the "boy-manager" of Washington in
A13 1870 1924, and Eddie Dyer of the St& Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished
A13 1880 the feat.
A14 0010 _PHILADELPHIA, JAN& 23_- Nick Skorich, the line coach for the
A14 0020 football champion Philadelphia Eagles, was elevated today to head
A14 0030 coach.   Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed
A14 0040 to be between $20,000 and $25,000 a year. He succeeds Buck Shaw,
A14 0050 who retired at the end of last season.   The appointment was
A14 0060 announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain
A14 0070 two members of Shaw's staff- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer.
A14 0080    Williams is a defensive coach. Gauer works with the ends.
A14 0090 #CHOICE WAS EXPECTED# The selection had been expected. Skorich
A14 0100 was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin
A14 0110 permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings,
A14 0120 the newest National Football League entry.   Van Brocklin,
A14 0130 the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title, was signed by the
A14 0140 Vikings last Wednesday. Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better
A14 0150 connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end
A14 0160 his career as a player.   With Skorich at the helm, the Eagles
A14 0170 are expected to put more emphasis on running, rather than passing. In
A14 0180 the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's aerials.
A14 0190    Skorich, however, is a strong advocate of a balanced attack- split
A14 0200 between running and passing. #COACH PLAYED 3 YEARS# Skorich,
A14 0210 who is 39 years old, played football at Cincinnati University and
A14 0220 then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland
A14 0230 with the Pittsburgh Steelers.   An injury forced Skorich
A14 0240 to quit after the 1948 season. He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh
A14 0250 Central Catholic High School in 1949. He remained there
A14 0260 for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
A14 0270 in Troy, N& Y&. He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers
A14 0280 as an assistant coach.   Four years later he resigned to
A14 0290 take a similar job with the Green Bay Packers. The Eagles signed
A14 0300 him for Shaw's staff in 1959.   Skorich began his new job auspiciously
A14 0310 today. At a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson
A14 0320 Dilworth, the Eagles were honored for winning the championship.
A14 0330    Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players, coaches and team
A14 0340 officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation
A14 0350 and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football.
A14 0360    With the announcement of a "special achievement award" to
A14 0370 William A& (Bill) Shea, the awards list was completed yesterday
A14 0380 for Sunday night's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New
A14 0390 York Chapter, Baseball Writers' Association of America, at the
A14 0400 Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.   Shea, the chairman of Mayor Wagner's
A14 0410 Baseball Committee, will be joined on the dais by Warren Spahn,
A14 0420 the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee Braves; Frank Graham,
A14 0430 the Journal-American sports columnist; Bill Mazeroski, the
A14 0440 World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates, and Casey Stengel,
A14 0450 the former manager of the Yankees.   Stengel will receive the
A14 0460 Ben Epstein Good Guy Award. Mazeroski, whose homer beat the Yankees
A14 0470 in the final series game, will receive the Babe Ruth Award as
A14 0480 the outstanding player in the 1960 world series.   Graham will
A14 0490 be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the
A14 0500 William J& Slocum Memorial Award. To Spahn will go the Sid
A14 0510 Mercer Memorial Award as the chapter's player of the year. #SHOW
A14 0520 FOLLOWS CEREMONIES# A crowd of 1,400 is expected for the ceremonies,
A14 0530 which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon
A14 0540 baseball personalities in skit, dance and song.   The 53-year-old
A14 0550 Shea, a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background,
A14 0560 is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return
A14 0570 of a National League club to New York. Named by Mayor Wagner
A14 0575 three years ago
A14 0580 to head a committee that included James A& Farley,
A14 0590 Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume, Shea worked relentlessly.
A14 0600    His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city. The
A14 0610 departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York
A14 0620 with only the Yankees.   Despite countless barriers and disappointments,
A14 0630 Shea moved forward. When he was unable to bring about
A14 0640 immediate expansion, he sought to convince another National League
A14 0650 club to move here.   When that failed, he enlisted Branch Rickey's
A14 0660 aid in the formation of a third major league, the Continental,
A14 0670 with New York as the key franchise. The Continental League never
A14 0680 got off the ground, but after two years it forced the existing majors
A14 0690 to expand. #FLUSHING STADIUM IN WORKS# The New York franchise
A14 0700 is headed by Mrs& Charles Shipman Payson. A big-league municipal
A14 0710 stadium at Flushing Meadow Park is in the works, and once the lease
A14 0720 is signed the local club will be formally recognized by Commissioner
A14 0730 Ford C& Frick. Shea's efforts figure prominently in the new
A14 0740 stadium.   Shea and his wife, Nori, make their home at Sands
A14 0750 Point, L& I&. Bill Jr&, 20; Kathy, 15, and Patricia,
A14 0760 9, round out the Shea family.   Shea was born in Manhattan. He
A14 0770 attended New York University before switching to Georgetown University
A14 0780 in Washington. He played basketball there while working toward
A14 0790 a law degree.   Later, Shea owned and operated the Long Island
A14 0800 Indians, a minor league professional football team. He was the lawyer
A14 0810 for Ted Collins' old Boston Yankees in the National Football
A14 0820 League. #@# All was quiet in the office of the Yankees
A14 0830 and the local National Leaguers yesterday. On Friday, Roger Maris,
A14 0840 the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American League's most-valuable-player
A14 0850 award, will meet with Roy Hamey, the general manager.
A14 0860 Maris is in line for a big raise.
A14 0870    Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those honored at
A14 0880 the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association
A14 0890 tonight. The dinner will be held at the Hotel Pierre.
A14 0900 Palmer, golf's leading money-winner in 1960, and Snead will be saluted
A14 0910 as the winning team in the Canada Cup matches last June in Dublin.
A14 0920 Deane Beman, the National Amateur champion, and all the metropolitan
A14 0930 district champions, including Bob Gardner, the amateur title-holder,
A14 0940 also will receive awards.   The writers' Gold Tee
A14 0950 Award will go to John McAuliffe of Plainfield, N& J&, and
A14 0960 Palm Beach, Fla&, for his sponsorship of charity tournaments. Horton
A14 0970 Smith of Detroit, a former president of the Professional Golfers
A14 0980 Association, will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for his comeback
A14 0990 following a recent illness.   The principal speaker will be Senator
A14 1000 Stuart Symington, Democrat of Missouri.
A14 1010 #GOLF'S GOLDEN BOY# ARNOLD PALMER has been a blazing figure
A14 1020 in golf over the past twelve months. He won the Masters, the United
A14 1030 States Open and a record $80,738 in prize money. He was heralded
A14 1040 as "Sportsman of the Year" by Sports Illustrated, and last night
A14 1050 was acclaimed in Rochester as the "Professional Athlete of the
A14 1060 Year", a distinction that earned for him the $10,000 diamond- studded
A14 1070 Hickok Belt.   But he also achieved something that endeared
A14 1080 him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot. A couple of weeks ago,
A14 1090 he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole. It made him human. And
A14 1100 it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were
A14 1110 meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving
A14 1120 them to despair. If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could
A14 1130 commit such a scoring sacrilege, there was hope left for all.   It
A14 1140 was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden
A14 1150 that motivated Arnold. He merely became victimized by a form
A14 1160 of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all. The world's
A14 1170 best golfer, shooting below par, came to the last hole of the opening
A14 1180 round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering
A14 1190 a final crusher. He boomed a 280-yard drive. Then the pixies and the
A14 1200 zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance. #NO MARGIN
A14 1210 FOR ERROR# On the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole, Arnold whipped
A14 1220 into his second shot. The ball went off in a majestic arc, an
A14 1230 out-of-bounds slice. He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds.
A14 1240 He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side.
A14 1250 "It is possible that I over-corrected", he said ruefully. Each
A14 1260 of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes. So he wound up with a
A14 1270 dozen.   "It was a nice round figure, that 12", he said as
A14 1280 he headed for the clubhouse, not too much perturbed.   From the
A14 1290 standpoint of the army of duffers, however, this was easily the most heartening
A14 1300 exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways
A14 1310 during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open. The idol of
A14 1320 the hackers, of course, is Ray Ainsley, who achieved a 19 in the United
A14 1330 States Open. Their secondary hero is another pro, Willie Chisholm,
A14 1340 who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his
A14 1350 way out of a rock-strewn gully. Willie's partner was Long Jim Barnes,
A14 1360 who tried to keep count. #STICKLER FOR RULES# "How many
A14 1370 is that, Jim"? asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project.
A14 1380    "Thirteen", said Long Jim.   "Nae, man",
A14 1390 said Willie, "ye must be countin' the echoes". He had a 16.
A14 1400    Palmer's dozen were honestly earned. Nor were there any rules
A14 1410 to save him. If there had been, he would have found a loophole, because
A14 1420 Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man
A14 1430 who wrote the book. This knowledge has come in handy, too.   His
A14 1440 first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along
A14 1450 the right side of the fairway. The ball floated downstream. A spectator
A14 1460 picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy, who dropped this
A14 1470 suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie.   Arnold sent for
A14 1480 Joe Dey, the executive secretary of the golf association. Joe naturally
A14 1490 ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had
A14 1500 originally entered the stream.   "I knew it all along", confessed
A14 1510 Arnold with a grin, "but I just happened to think how much
A14 1520 nicer it would be to drop one way up there".   For a serious young
A14 1530 man who plays golf with a serious intensity, Palmer has such an
A14 1540 inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves
A14 1550 from jangling like banjo strings. Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors.
A14 1560 He'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure
A14 1570 he's right. That's how he first won the Masters in 1958.
A14 1580 It happened on the twelfth hole, a 155-yarder. Arnold's iron shot
A14 1585 from
A14 1590 the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green, an embankment
A14 1600 that had become soft and spongy from the rains, thereby bringing local
A14 1610 rules into force. #RULING FROM ON HIGH# "I can remove the ball,
A14 1620 can't I"? asked Palmer of an official.   "No", said
A14 1630 the official. "You must play it where it lies".   "You're
A14 1640 wrong", said Arnold, a man who knows the rules. "I'll do
A14 1650 as you say, but I'll also play a provisional ball and get a
A14 1655 ruling".
A14 1660    He scored a 4 for the embedded ball, a 3 with the provisional
A14 1670 one. The golfing fathers ruled in his favor. So he picked up a stroke
A14 1680 with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of
A14 1690 that stroke.   Until a few weeks ago, however, Arnold Palmer
A14 1700 was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers.
A14 1710 But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys, a bigger
A14 1720 hero than he ever had been before.
A14 1730    A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings
A14 1735 and
A14 1740 the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will
A14 1750 be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the
A14 1760 Hotel Warwick today.   Other items on the agenda during the
A14 1770 meetings, which are expected to continue through Saturday, concern television,
A14 1780 rules changes, professional football's hall of fame, players'
A14 1790 benefits and constitutional amendments.   The owners would
A14 1800 like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series
A14 1810 with teams in its division, plus two games against teams in the other
A14 1820 division. However, this would require a lengthening of the season
A14 1830 from thirteen to fourteen weeks.   Pete Rozelle, the league commissioner,
A14 1840 pointed out:   "We'll have the problem of baseball
A14 1850 at one end and weather at the other".   Nine of the league's
A14 1860 teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season
A14 1870 conflict in dates.
A15 0010    If the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies,
A15 0020 they won't be misled by the Pirates' slower start this season.
A15 0030    "Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat", Mauch said here
A15 0040 the other day. "The Pirates showed they could outclass the field
A15 0050 last year. They have the same men, no age problem, no injuries and
A15 0060 they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season, along with
A15 0070 Bobby Shantz".   Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals, who
A15 0080 gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960, breaking even
A15 0090 with them, will get their first 1961 shot at baseball's world champions.
A15 0100 The Pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the Redbirds are
A15 0110 7-9. #CHANGE IN PITCHERS.# Solly Hemus announced a switch in his
A15 0120 starting pitcher, from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio, for several
A15 0130 reasons: 1. Broglio's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run mark
A15 0140 against Pittsburgh a year ago; 2. The desire to give Broglio as
A15 0150 many starts as possible; 3. The Redbirds' disheartening 11-7 collapse
A15 0160 against the Phillies Sunday.   Manager Hemus, eager to
A15 0170 end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games
A15 0180 on the current home stand, moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting
A15 0190 assignment. After Thursday's open date, Solly plans to open with
A15 0200 Larry Jackson against the Cubs here Friday night.   Harvey
A15 0210 Haddix, set back by the flu this season, will start against his former
A15 0220 Cardinal mates, who might be playing without captain Kenny Boyer
A15 0230 in tonight's game at Busch Stadium. Boyer is suffering from a stiff
A15 0240 neck.   Haddix has a 13-8 record against the Redbirds, despite
A15 0250 only a 1-3 mark in 1960.   Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh
A15 0260 said he hadn't decided between Mizell and Vern Law for Wednesday's
A15 0270 game. Mizell has won both of his starts. #NIEMAN KEPT IN LINEUP.#
A15 0280 After a lengthy workout yesterday, an open date, Hemus said that
A15 0290 Bob Nieman definitely would stay in the lineup. That means Stan
A15 0300 Musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his
A15 0310 record five-home run day against the Giants.   "I have to stay
A15 0320 with Nieman for a while", Hemus said. "Bill White (sore ankles)
A15 0330 should be ready. With a lefthander going for Pittsburgh, I may
A15 0340 use Don Taussig in center".   "Lindy McDaniel threw batting
A15 0350 practice about 25 minutes, and he looked good", Hemus said. "He
A15 0360 should be getting back in the groove before long. Our pitching
A15 0370 is much better than it has shown".   The statistics hardly indicated
A15 0380 that the Pirates needed extra batting practice, but Murtaugh
A15 0390 also turned his men loose at Busch Stadium yesterday. #SIX BUCKS OVER
A15 0400 .300.# Until the Bucs' bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati
A15 0410 over the weekend, the champions had eight men hitting over .300. Despite
A15 0420 the recession, Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list
A15 0430 of averages: Smoky Burgess .455, Gino Cimoli .389, Bill Virdon
A15 0440 .340, Bob Clemente and Dick Groat, each .323, Dick Stuart .306,
A15 0450 Don Hoak .280 and Bob Skinner .267.   Bill Mazeroski with
A15 0460 .179 and Hal Smith with .143 were the only Pirates dragging their
A15 0470 feet.   Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the
A15 0480 news that Musial probably will sit out most of the series is Bob Friend,
A15 0490 who was beaten by The Man twice last season on dramatic home
A15 0500 runs. Friend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn't likely
A15 0510 to see action here this week.   "We're getting Friend
A15 0520 some runs for a change, and he has been pitching good", Murtaugh said.
A15 0530 "Virdon has been blasting the ball. No plunkers for him". #SIX
A15 0540 BUCS OVER .300.# The Pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by May
A15 0550 1 last year, when the Redbirds as well as the Dodgers held them
A15 0560 even over the season. On last May 1, the Cardinals stood at 7-6, ending
A15 0570 a two-season fall-off on that milestone. In 1958, the Birds were
A15 0580 3-10 on May 1. A year later they were 4-13.   Since 1949, the
A15 0590 St& Louis club has been below .500 on May 1 just four times. The
A15 0600 '49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning, then fell as low as 12-17
A15 0610 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories.   The '52 Cards
A15 0620 were 6-7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs, the club's top
A15 0625 since
A15 0630 1949. Then last season the Birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on May
A15 0640 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories.
A15 0650    Since 1949, the only National League club that got off to a hot
A15 0660 start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team. Those
A15 0670 Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game
A15 0680 lead by May 8. The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable
A15 0690 period to win the pennant was New York's '51 Giants, who
A15 0700 dropped 11 of their first 13.
A15 0710    They honored the battling Billikens last night. Speakers at
A15 0720 a Tipoff Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St& Louis
A15 0730 University players who, in the words of Coach John Benington, "had
A15 0740 more confidence in themselves than I did".   The most valuable
A15 0750 player award was split three ways, among Glen Mankowski, Gordon
A15 0760 Hartweger and Tom Kieffer. In addition, a special award was given
A15 0770 to Bob (Bevo) Nordmann, the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of
A15 0780 the season because of a knee injury.   "You often hear people
A15 0790 talk about team spirit and that sort of thing", Benington said in a
A15 0800 conversation after the ceremonies, "but what this team had was a little
A15 0810 different. The boys had a tremendous respect for each other's
A15 0820 ability. They knew what they could do and it was often a little more
A15 0830 than I thought they could do.
A15 0840    "Several times I found the players
A15 0850 pepping me up, where it usually is the coach who is supposed to
A15 0860 deliver the fight talk. We'd be losing at halftime to a good team
A15 0870 and Hartweger would say, 'Don't worry, Coach- we'll get 'em
A15 0880 all right'".   The trio who shared the most-valuable honors
A15 0890 were introduced by Bob Broeg, sports editor of the Post-Dispatch.
A15 0900    Kieffer, the only junior in the group, was commended for his
A15 0910 ability to hit in the clutch, as well as his all-round excellent play.
A15 0920    Mankowski, the ball-hawking defensive expert, was cited for
A15 0930 his performance against Bradley in St& Louis U&'s nationally
A15 0940 televised victory. Benington said, "I've never seen a player
A15 0950 have a game as great as Mankowski did against Bradley that day".
A15 0960    Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that he doubted
A15 0970 Gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking
A15 0980 in all of the accepted basketball skills. After the coach listed all
A15 0990 the boy's faults, Hartweger said, "Coach before I leave here,
A15 1000 you'll get to like me".   Mrs& Benington admired Gordon's
A15 1010 spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy
A15 1020 might help the team.   As Hartweger accepted his silver bowl,
A15 1030 he said, "I want to thank coach's wife for talking him into letting
A15 1040 me play".   Bob Burnes, sports editor of the Globe-Democrat,
A15 1050 presented Bob Nordmann with his award. Bevo was congratulated for
A15 1060 his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his
A15 1070 knee healed in time. Within a week after the injury, suffered in St&
A15 1080 Louis's victory in the final game of the Kentucky tournament, Nordmann
A15 1090 was sitting on the Bill's bench doing what he could to help
A15 1100 Benington.   On the clock given him was the inscription, "For
A15 1110 Outstanding Contribution to Billiken Basketball, 1960-61".
A15 1120    Other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished
A15 1130 as runner-up in the National Invitation Tournament were:
A15 1140 Art Hambric, Donnell Reid, Bill Nordmann, Dave Harris, Dave Luechtefeld
A15 1150 and George Latinovich.   "This team set a precedent
A15 1160 that could be valuable in the future", Benington pointed out. "By
A15 1170 winning against Bradley, Kentucky and Notre Dame on those teams'
A15 1180 home courts, they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome
A15 1190 anywhere and that it doesn's take a super team to do it".
A15 1200    St& Louis University found a way to win a baseball game. Larry
A15 1210 Scherer last night pitched a no-hit game, said to be the first
A15 1220 in Billiken baseball history, as the Blue and White beat Southeast
A15 1230 Missouri State College, 5-1, at Crystal City.   The victory
A15 1240 was the first of the season for the Billikens after nine defeats and
A15 1250 a tie. The tie was against Southeast Missouri last Friday.
A15 1260 Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including
A15 1270 a double, Len Boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and Dave
A15 1280 Ritchie had a home run and a triple.   St& Louis U&
A15 1290 was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against Washington
A15 1300 University at Ligget Field.   The game opened a busy
A15 1310 week for Washington. The Bears are set to play at Harris Teachers
A15 1320 College at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy, Ill&,
A15 1330 Saturday.
A15 1340 #HAPPY HITTING# If it's true that contented cows give more milk,
A15 1350 why shouldn't happy ball players produce more base hits?
A15 1360 The two top talents of the time, Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays,
A15 1365 have
A15 1370 hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season
A15 1380 than at any period in careers which, to be frank about it, never have
A15 1390 quite reached expectations.   And that's meant as a boost, not
A15 1400 a knock.   Mays and Mantle, both 10-year men at 30, have so
A15 1410 much ability that, baseball men agree, they've never hit the heights.
A15 1420 Their heights, that is.   Mantle, the bull-necked blond switch-hitter,
A15 1430 had one sensational triple-crown season, 1959, when he batted
A15 1440 .365 and also led the American League in home runs, 52, and ~RBIs,
A15 1450 130.   Like the Yankees' slugger, Mays, the terror of
A15 1460 the Giants, has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by
A15 1470 most players, but not by- or for- Willie. His best years were 1954
A15 1480 when he hit .345 with 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home runs,
A15 1490 drove in 127 and stole 24 bases.   Now, apparently happier
A15 1500 under new managers, Mays and Mantle, the perfect players, are behaving
A15 1510 as though they're going to pass those previous peaks. #LABOR RELATIONS#
A15 1520 Yes, we know, they're professionals, men paid to play, and
A15 1530 they shouldn't care how they're handled, just as long as their
A15 1540 names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month.
A15 1550    The truth is, though, that men react differently to different
A15 1560 treatment. For that matter, Stan Musial is rare, possessing the disposition
A15 1570 that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers, reserving
A15 1580 his opinions, but not
A15 1590 his effort.   Mantle, it's apparent,
A15 1600 resented Casey Stengel's attempts to push and prod him into the
A15 1610 perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility. The old
A15 1620 man was almost too possessive. Stengel inherited DiMaggio, Rizzuto,
A15 1630 but HE brought up Mantle from Class ~C to the majors, from
A15 1640 Joplin to New York.   With the speed and power of the body
A15 1650 beautiful he saw before him, Ol' Case wanted No& 7 to be not
A15 1660 only the best homerun hitter, but also the best bunter, base-runner and
A15 1670 outfielder. Stengel probably preached too much in the early days when
A15 1680 the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats.   Inheriting
A15 1690 a more mature Mantle, who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway,
A15 1700 Ralph Houk quietly bestowed, no pun intended, the mantle of
A15 1710 authority on Mickey. The Major decided that, rather than be led,
A15 1720 the slugger could lead. And what leadership a proud Mantle has given
A15 1730 so far.   The opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule,
A15 1740 pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting
A15 1750 target in Los Angeles' Wrigley Field Jr&, Mantle just might
A15 1760 break the most glamorous record on the books, Babe Ruth's 60 homers
A15 1770 of 1927. #FOUR FOR ALVIN# Mays' day came a day earlier for
A15 1780 Willie than for the kids and Commies this year. Willie's wonderful
A15 1790 walloping Sunday- four home runs- served merely to emphasize how
A15 1800 happy he is to be playing for Alvin Dark.   Next to Leo Durocher,
A15 1810 Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed
A15 1820 up to the Polo Grounds 10 years ago this month, to help the Giants
A15 1830 win a dramatic pennant.
A16 0010    ROMANTIC news concerns Mrs& Joan Monroe Armour and
A16 0020 F& Lee H& Wendell, who are to be married at 4:30 p& m& tomorrow
A16 0030 in the Lake Forest home of her brother, J& Hampton Monroe,
A16 0040 and Mrs& Monroe. Only the families and a dozen close friends
A16 0050 will be present.   The bride's brother, Walter D& Monroe
A16 0060 Jr&, will give her in marriage. In the small group will be the junior
A16 0070 and senior Mrs& Walter Monroe; the bridegroom's parents,
A16 0080 the Barrett Wendells, who are returning from a winter holiday in Sarasota,
A16 0090 Fla&, for the occasion; and his brother, Mr& Wendell
A16 0100 Jr&, and his wife, who will arrive from Boston. Mr& Wendell Jr&
A16 0110 will be best man.   Also present will be the bride's children,
A16 0120 Joan, 13, and Kirkland, 11. Their father is Charles B& Armour.
A16 0130 The bridegroom's children were here for the Christmas holidays
A16 0140 and can't return. Young Peter Wendell, a student at the Westminster
A16 0150 school, has measles, and his sister, Mrs& Andrew Thomas,
A16 0160 and her husband, who live in Missoula, Mont&, have a new baby. Their
A16 0170 mother is Mrs& Camilla Alsop Wendell.   Mr& Wendell
A16 0180 and his bride will live in his Lake Forest house. They will take a
A16 0190 wedding trip later. #'BACK WITH THE MET'# "We are back with
A16 0200 the 'Met' again now that the 'Met' is back in
A16 0205 Chicago",
A16 0210 bulletins Mrs& Frank S& Sims, president of the women's board
A16 0220 of the University of Chicago Cancer Research Foundation. The New
A16 0230 York Metropolitan Opera Company will be here in May, and the board
A16 0240 will sponsor the Saturday night, May 13, performance of "Turandot"
A16 0250 as a benefit. Birgit Nilsson will be starred.   "Housed
A16 0260 in the new McCormick Place theater, this should prove to be an
A16 0270 exciting evening", adds Mrs& Sims. The board's last money raising
A16 0280 event was a performance by Harry Belafonte- "quite off-beat
A16 0290 for this group", decided some of the members. Mrs& Henry T&
A16 0300 Sulcer of Winnetka, a new board member, will be chairman of publicity
A16 0310 for the benefit. Her husband recently was appointed vice president
A16 0320 of the university, bringing them back here from the east. #PARICHY-HAMM#
A16 0330 Because of the recent death of the bride's father, Frederick
A16 0340 B& Hamm, the marriage of Miss Terry Hamm to John Bruce Parichy
A16 0350 will be a small one at noon tomorrow in St& Bernadine's church,
A16 0360 Forest Park. A small reception will follow in the Oak Park Arms
A16 0370 hotel.   Mrs& Hamm will not come from Vero Beach, Fla&,
A16 0380 for the wedding. However, Mr& Parichy and his bride will go
A16 0390 to Vero Beach on their wedding trip, and will stay in the John G&
A16 0400 Beadles' beach house. The Beadles formerly lived in Lake Forest.
A16 0410    Harvey B& Stevens of Kenilworth will give his niece in

A16 0430 and aunts, the Rush C& Butlers, the Homer E& Robertsons, and
A16 0440 the David Q& Porters, will give the bridal dinner tonight in the
A16 0450 Stevenses' home. #HERE AND THERE# The Chicago Press club will
A16 0460 fete George E& Barnes, president of the United States Lawn
A16 0470 Tennis association, at a cocktail party and buffet supper beginning

A16 0500 at 8 p& m&.
A16 0510    WITH loud huzzahs for the artistic success of the Presbyterian-St&
A16 0520 Luke's Fashion show still ringing in her ears, its director,
A16 0530 Helen Tieken Geraghty [Mrs& Maurice P& Geraghty]
A16 0540 is taking off tomorrow on a 56 day world trip which should earn her even
A16 0550 greater acclaim as director of entertainment for next summer's International
A16 0560 Trade fair. Armed with letters from embassies to ministers
A16 0570 of countries, especially those in the near and far east, Mrs&
A16 0580 Geraghty "will beat the bushes for oriental talent".   "We
A16 0590 [the Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry] expect to establish
A16 0600 closer relations with nations and their cultural activities,
A16 0610 and it will be easy as a member of the fair staff to bring in acts",
A16 0620 explains Mrs& Geraghty. "For instance, Djakarta, Indonesia,
A16 0630 has three groups of dancers interested in coming here. I'm even going
A16 0640 to try to get the whirling dervishes of Damascus"!   The
A16 0650 last obstacle in Mrs& Geraghty's globe-girdling trip was smoothed
A16 0660 out when a representative of Syria called upon her to explain that
A16 0670 his brother would meet her at the border of that country- so newly
A16 0680 separated from Egypt and the United Arab Republic that she hadn't
A16 0690 been able to obtain a visa. #FIRST, HONOLULU# Honolulu will be
A16 0700 Mrs& Geraghty's first stop. Then Japan, Hong Kong, Manila,
A16 0710 India, Pakistan, Damascus, Beirut, and to Rome, London, and Paris
A16 0720 "to look over wonderful talent".   Dec& 22 is the deadline
A16 0730 for Mrs& Geraghty's return; the Geraghtys' youngest daughter,
A16 0740 Molly, bows in the Passavant Debutante Cotillion the next
A16 0750 night. Molly already has her cotillion gown, and it's fitted, says
A16 0760 her mother. Also, invitations have been addressed to Molly's debut
A16 0770 tea the afternoon of Dec& 29 in the Arts club.   It won't
A16 0780 be a "tea", however, but more of an international folk song festival,
A16 0790 with singers from Chicago's foreign groups to sing Christmas
A16 0800 songs from around the world. The international theme will be continued
A16 0810 with the Balkan strings playing for a dinner the Byron Harveys will
A16 0820 give in the Racquet club after the tea. Miss Abra Prentice's
A16 0830 debut supper dance in the Casino will wind up the day. #BURKE-ROSTAGNO#
A16 0840 The Richard S& Burkes' home in Wayne may be the setting
A16 0850 for the wedding reception for their daughter, Helen Lambert, and the
A16 0860 young Italian she met last year while studying in Florence during
A16 0870 her junior year at Smith college. He is Aldo Rostagno, son of the
A16 0880 Guglielmo Rostagnos of Florence whom the Burkes met last year in
A16 0890 Europe. The Burkes, who now live in Kankakee, are telling friends
A16 0900 of the engagement.   Miss Burke, a graduate of Miss Hall's
A16 0910 school, stayed on in Florence as a career girl. Her fiance, who is with
A16 0920 a publishing firm, translates many books from English into Italian.
A16 0930 He will be coming here on business in December, when the wedding
A16 0940 is to take place in Wayne. Miss Burke will arrive in December also.

A17 0580 Scarsdale, N&Y&.   Mrs& Kelsey is the former {Miss
A17 0590 Ann Rickenbaugh}.
A17 0600    A cheery smile, a compassionate interest in others and a practical
A17 0610 down-to-earth approach.   Those qualities make {Esther Marr}
A17 0620 a popular asset at the Salvation Army's Social
A17 0630 Center at 1200 Larimer st&.   The pert, gray-haired woman
A17 0640 who came to Denver three years ago from Buffalo, N&Y&, is
A17 0650 a "civilian" with the Army.   Her position covers a number
A17 0660 of daily tasks common to any social director. The job also covers a
A17 0670 number of other items.   "Mom" Marr, as the more than 80 men
A17 0675 at the center call her,
A17 0680 is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between
A17 0690 alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society.
A17 0700    Her day starts early, but no matter how many pressing letters
A17 0710 there are to be written (and during May, which is National Salvation
A17 0720 Army Week, there are plenty), schedules to be made or problems
A17 0730 to be solved, Mrs& Marr's office is always open and the welcome
A17 0740 mat is out.   {MRS& MARR} is the first contact a Skid
A17 0745 Row
A17 0750 figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up.
A17 0760    She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and
A17 0770 the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and
A17 0780 explains procedures.   "Usually at this point a man is withdrawn
A17 0790 from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle
A17 0800 with his fellow men", Mrs& Marr explained.   The Denverite
A17 0810 has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities
A17 0820 of the center.   "And I bum tickets to everything I can",
A17 0830 she said. "I've become the greatest beggar in the world".
A17 0835    {IN ADDITION}
A17 0840 to the tickets to the movies, sporting events
A17 0850 and concerts, Mrs& Marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics
A17 0860 require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system.
A17 0870    Mrs& Marr also has a number of parolees to "mother", watching
A17 0880 to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn
A17 0890 to readjust to society.
A17 0900    By mid-June, millions of Americans will take to the road on
A17 0910 vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely
A17 0920 land.   In another four weeks, with schools closed across the
A17 0930 nation, the great all-American summer safari will be under way. By
A17 0940 July 1, six weeks from now, motel-keepers all over the nation will,
A17 0950 by 6 p&m&, be switching on that bleak- to motorists- sign, "No
A17 0960 Vacancy".   No matter how many Americans go abroad in
A17 0970 summer, probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car, throw
A17 0980 suitcases, kids and comic books in the back seat, and head for home. And
A17 0990 where is "home", that magic place of the heart?   Ah,
A17 1000 that is simple. Home is where a man was born, reared, went to school
A17 1010 and, most particularly, where grandma is. That is where we turn in the
A17 1020 good old summertime.   The land lies ready for the coming onslaught.
A17 1030 My husband and I, a month ahead of the rush, have just finished
A17 1040 a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson, Ariz&, to New
A17 1050 York City: #SET FOR INFLUX# I can testify that motels, service
A17 1060 and comfort stations (they go together like Scots and heather), dog
A17 1070 wagons, roadside restaurants, souvenir stands and snake farms are braced
A17 1080 and waiting.   I hope it can be said without boasting that
A17 1090 no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty
A17 1100 of scene, such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and
A17 1110 such decent, far-flung over-night accommodations.   Maybe motel-keeping
A17 1120 isn't the nation's biggest industry, but it certainly looks
A17 1130 that way from the highway.   There are motels for all purposes
A17 1140 and all tastes. There are even motels for local weather peculiarities,
A17 1150 as I discovered in Shamrock, Tex&. There the Royal Motel
A17 1160 advertises "all facilities, vented heat, air conditioned, carpeted,
A17 1170 free ~TV, storm cellar". #MANY WITH POOLS# Innumerable motels
A17 1180 from Tucson to New York boast swimming pools ("swim at your
A17 1190 own risk" is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools).
A17 1200 Some even boast two pools, one for adults and one for children. But
A17 1210 the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort
A17 1220 and security of a storm cellar.   Motorists like myself who
A17 1230 can remember the old "tourists accommodated" signs on farm houses
A17 1240 and village homes before World War /2, can only marvel at the great
A17 1250 size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business.
A17 1260 #ALL FOR $14!# At the Boxwood Motel in Winchester,
A17 1270 Va&, we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite, an elegant affair with
A17 1280 wall-to-wall carpeting, gold and white furniture, pink satin brocade
A17 1290 chairs, 24-inch ~TV and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels.
A17 1300 All for $14.   That made up for the "best" motel in Norman,
A17 1310 Okla&, where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8.50 tab when
A17 1320 we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture.
A17 1330    Oxnard, Calif&, will be the home of the Rev& Robert D&
A17 1340 Howard and his bride, the former Miss Judith Ellen Gay, who were
A17 1350 married Saturday at the Munger Place Methodist Church.
A17 1360 Parents of the bride are Mr& and Mrs& Ferris M& Gay, 7034
A17 1370 Coronado. The bridegroom is the son of Mrs& James Baines of Los
A17 1380 Angeles, Calif&, and Carl E& Howard of Santa Monica, Calif&.
A17 1390 He is a graduate of ~UCLA and Perkins School of Theology,
A17 1400 ~SMU.   Dr& W& B& I& Martin officiated, and
A17 1410 the bride was given in marriage by her father. Honor attendants for
A17 1420 the couple were Miss Sandra Branum and Warren V& McRoberts.
A17 1430    The couple will honeymoon in Sequoia National Park, Calif&.
A17 1450    Miss Joan Frances Baker, a graduate of ~SMU, was married
A17 1460 Saturday to Elvis Leonard Mason, an honor graduate of Lamar State
A17 1470 College of Technology, in the chapel of the First Presbyterian
A17 1480 Church of Houston.   The bride, daughter of Rhodes Semmes
A17 1490 Baker Jr& of Houston and the late Mrs& Baker, was president of
A17 1500 Kappa Kappa Gamma and a member of Mortar Board at ~SMU. Her
A17 1510 husband, who is the son of Alton John Mason of Shreveport, La&,
A17 1520 and the late Mrs& Henry Cater Parmer, was president of Alpha
A17 1530 Tau Omega and a member of Delta Sigma Pi at Lamar Tech, and did
A17 1540 graduate work at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa,
A17 1550 on a Rotary Fellowship.   The Rev& Richard Freeman of
A17 1560 Texas City officiated and Charles Pabor and Mrs& Marvin Hand
A17 1570 presented music. The bride was given in marriage by her father.
A17 1580    She wore a court-length gown of organdy designed with bateau neckline
A17 1590 and princesse skirt accented by lace appliques. Her veil was caught
A17 1600 to a crown, and she carried gardenias and stephanotis.   Miss
A17 1610 Mary Ross of Baird was maid of honor, and bridesmaids were Miss Pat
A17 1620 Dawson of Austin, Mrs& Howard M& Dean of Hinsdale, Ill&,
A17 1630 and Mrs& James A& Reeder of Shreveport, La&.   Cecil
A17 1640 Mason of Hartford, Conn&, was best man for his brother, and
A17 1650 groomsmen were Rhodes S& Baker /3, of Houston, Dr& James
A17 1660 Carter of Houston and Conrad McEachern of New Orleans, La&.
A17 1670 Lee Jackson and Ken Smith, both of Houston, and Alfred Neumann
A17 1680 of Beaumont seated guests.   After a reception at The Mayfair,
A17 1690 the newlyweds left for a wedding trip to New Orleans, La&. They
A17 1700 will live in Corpus Christi.
A17 1710    Miss Shirley Joan Meredith, a former student of North Texas
A17 1720 State University, was married Saturday to Larry W& Mills, who
A17 1730 has attended Arlington State College. They will live at 2705 Fitzhugh
A17 1740 after a wedding trip to Corpus Christi.   Parents of the
A17 1750 couple are Ray Meredith of Denton and the late Mrs& Meredith
A17 1760 and Mrs& Hardy P& Mills of Floresville and the late Mr& Mills.
A17 1770    The Rev& Melvin Carter officiated at the ceremony
A17 1780 in Slaughter Chapel of the First Baptist Church. Dan Beam presented
A17 1790 music and the bride was given in marriage by her father.
A17 1800 She wore a gown of satin designed along princesse lines and featuring
A17 1810 a flared skirt and lace jacket with bateau neckline. Her veil was
A17 1820 caught to a pearl headdress, and she carried stephanotis and orchids.
A17 1830    Miss Glenda Kay Meredith of Denton was her sister's maid
A17 1840 or honor, and Vernon Lewelleyn of San Angelo was best man. Robert
A17 1850 Lovelace and Cedric Burgher Jr& seated guests. A reception was
A17 1860 held at the church.
A17 1870    The First Christian Church of Pampa was the setting for the
A17 1880 wedding last Sunday of Miss Marcile Marie Glison and Thomas Earl
A17 1890 Loving Jr&, who will live at 8861 Gaston after a wedding trip
A17 1900 to New Orleans, La&   The bride, daughter of Mr& and Mrs&
A17 1910 Charles Ervin Glison of Pampa, has attended Texas Woman's
A17 1920 University and will continue her studies at ~SMU.
A18 0010    "A Night in New Orleans" is the gayety planned by members
A18 0020 of the Thrift Shop Committee for May 6 at Philmont Country Club.
A18 0030 The women have a reputation for giving parties that are different
A18 0040 and are fun and this year's promises to follow in this fine tradition.
A18 0050 Mrs& H& J& Grinsfelder is chairman.   The Louisiana
A18 0060 city is known, of course, for its fine food, good music and its colorful
A18 0065 hospitality "and,
A18 0070 when guests arrive at Philmont that night",
A18 0080 says Mrs& Grinsfelder, "that is exactly what we expect to offer
A18 0090 them. We've been working for weeks. The prospects look great.
A18 0100 We are keeping a number of surprises under our hats. But we can't
A18 0110 tell it all now and then have no new excitement later". #BASIN STREET
A18 0120 BEAT# But she does indicate festivities will start early, that
A18 0130 a jazz combo will "give with the Basin Street beat" during the
A18 0140 cocktail and dinner hours and that Lester Lanin's orchestra will take
A18 0150 over during the dancing.   As for food, Mrs& Henry Louchheim,
A18 0155 chairman of this phase,
A18 0160 is a globetrotter who knows good food. "New
A18 0170 Orleans"? she says, "of course I've had the best. It
A18 0180 is just bad luck that we are having the party in a month with no ~R's,
A18 0190 so no oysters. But we have lots of other New Orleans specialties.
A18 0200 I know they will be good. We've tried them out on the club chef-
A18 0210 or say, he has tried them out on us and we have selected the best".
A18 0220 #SCENIC EFFECTS# Guests will be treated to Gulf Coast scenic
A18 0230 effects. There will be masses of flowers, reproductions of the
A18 0240 handsome old buildings with their grillwork and other things that are
A18 0250 typical of New Orleans. Mrs& Harry K& Cohen is chairman of this
A18 0260 phase and she is getting an artistic assist from A& Van Hollander,
A18 0270 display director of Gimbel Brothers.   The gala is the Thrift
A18 0280 Shop's annual bundle party and, as all Thrift Shop friends
A18 0290 know, that means the admission is a bundle of used clothing in good condition,
A18 0300 contributions of household equipment, bric-a-brac and such to
A18 0310 stock the shelves at the shop's headquarters at 1213 Walnut St&.
A18 0320 #BUNDLE CENTERS# For the convenience of guests bundle centers
A18 0330 have been established throughout the city and suburbs where the donations
A18 0340 may be deposited between now and the date of the big event. In addition
A18 0350 to the bundles, guests pay the cost of their dinners. Members
A18 0360 of the young set who would like to come to the party only during the dancing
A18 0370 time are welcomed.   The Thrift Shop, with Mrs& Bernhard
A18 0380 S& Blumenthal as president, is one of the city's most successful
A18 0390 fund-raisers for the Federation of Jewish Agencies. Some idea
A18 0400 of the competence of the women is indicated in the contribution made
A18 0410 by them during the past 25 years that totals $840,000. #IT'S BIG
A18 0420 BUSINESS# "Big business, this little Thrift Shop business",
A18 0430 say the members. For most of the 25 years the operation was under feminine
A18 0440 direction. In the past few years the men, mostly husbands of members,
A18 0450 have taken an interest. Louis Glazer is chairman of the men's
A18 0460 committee that, among other jobs, takes over part of the responsibility
A18 0470 for staffing the shop during its evening hours.   Mrs& Theodore
A18 0480 Kapnek is vice chairman of the committee for the gala. Mrs&
A18 0490 Richard Newburger is chairman of hostesses.   Mrs& Arthur
A18 0500 Loeb is making arrangements for a reception; Mrs& Joan Lichtenstein,
A18 0510 for publicity; Mrs& Harry M& Rose, Jr&, for secretarial
A18 0520 duties; Mrs& Ralph Taussig, for junior aides; Mr& and
A18 0530 Mrs& B& Lewis Kaufnabb, for senior aides, and Mrs& Samuel
A18 0540 P& Weinberg, for the bundles.   In addition, Mr& and Mrs&
A18 0550 Allan Goodman are controllers, Mrs& Paul Stone is treasurer
A18 0560 and Mrs& Albert Quell is in charge of admittance for the dancing
A18 0570 at 9 P& M&.   Besides the bundle centers where contributions
A18 0580 may be made there will be facilities at Philmont Country Club
A18 0590 for those who would like to bring the bundles on the night of the party.
A18 0610    The women's committee of St& David's Church will hold
A18 0620 its annual pre-Fair pink parade, a dessert bridge and fashion show at
A18 0630 1 P& M& on Monday, April 17, in the chapel assembly room, Wayne.
A18 0640    Mrs& Robert O& Spurdle is chairman of the committee,
A18 0650 which includes Mrs& James A& Moody, Mrs& Frank C& Wilkinson,
A18 0660 Mrs& Ethel Coles, Mrs& Harold G& Lacy, Mrs&
A18 0670 Albert W& Terry, Mrs& Henry M& Chance, 2d, Mrs& Robert
A18 0680 O& Spurdle, Jr&, Mrs& Harcourt N& Trimble, Jr&, Mrs&
A18 0690 John A& Moller, Mrs& Robert Zeising, Mrs& William
A18 0700 G& Kilhour, Mrs& Hughes Cauffman, Mrs& John L& Baringer
A18 0710 and Mrs& Clyde Newman.   The fashion show, by Natalie
A18 0720 Collett will have Mrs& John Newbold as commentator. Models will
A18 0730 be Mrs& Samuel B& D& Baird, Mrs& William H& Meyle,
A18 0740 Jr&, Mrs& Richard W& Hole, Mrs& William F& Harrity,
A18 0750 Mrs& Robert O& Spurdle, Mrs& E& H& Kloman, Mrs&
A18 0760 Robert W& Wolcott, Jr&,
A18 0770 Mrs& Frederick C& Wheeler, Jr&,
A18 0780 Mrs& William ~A Boyd, ~Mrs F& Vernon Putt.
A18 0790    Col& Clifton Lisle, of Chester Springs, who headed the Troop
A18 0800 Committee for much of its second and third decades, is now an honorary
A18 0810 member. Each year he invites the boys to camp out on his estate
A18 0820 for one of their big week ends of the year.   The Troop is proud
A18 0830 of its camping-out program- on year-round schedule and was continued
A18 0840 even when sub-zero temperatures were registered during the past
A18 0850 winter.   "We worry", say the mothers. "But there never is
A18 0860 any need. The boys love it".   Mrs& John Charles Cotty
A18 0870 is chairman of publicity for the country fair and Mrs& Francis G&

A18 1770 the Achaeans entertained Wednesday last at their annual Carnival
A18 1780 masquerade ball, Miss Margaret Pierson was chosen to rule over the
A18 1790 festivities, presented at the Muncipal Auditorium and chosen as her
A18 1800 ladies in waiting were Misses Clayton Nairne, Eleanor Eustis, Lynn
A18 1810 Chapman, Irwin Leatherman of Robinsonville, Miss& and Helene
A18 1820 Rowley. The large municipal hall was ablaze with color, which shown
A18 1830 out from the bright array of chic ballgowns worn by those participating
A18 1840 in the "maskers' dances".   The mother of young queen,
A18 1850 Mrs& G& Henry Pierson Jr& chose a white brocade gown made
A18 1860 on slim lines with panels of tomato-red and bright green satin extending
A18 1870 down the back. Mrs& Thomas Jordan selected a black taffeta frock
A18 1880 made with a skirt of fringed tiers and worn with crimson silk slippers.
A18 1890 Mrs& Clayton Nairne, whose daughter, was among the court maids,
A18 1900 chose a deep greenish blue lace gown. Mrs& Fenwick Eustis, whose

A18 1920 satin gown. Mrs& Peter Feringa Jr&, last year's Achaeans'
A18 1930 queen, chose an eggshell white filmy lace short dress made with
A18 1940 a wide decolletage trimmed with an edging of tulle. Mrs& Eustis Reily's
A18 1945 olive-green
A18 1950 street length silk taffeta dress was embroidered on
A18 1960 the bodice with gold threads and golden sequins and beads.
A19 0010    The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would
A19 0020 reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary
A19 0030 cuts and lay-offs effective at 12.01 A&M& next Saturday. The
A19 0040 current monthly payroll comes to about $15,000,000.   Howard E&
A19 0050 Simpson, the railroad's president, said, "A drastic decline in
A19 0060 freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement
A19 0070 of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action".   The
A19 0080 reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in
A19 0090 which the B& + O& operates. #SALARY CUT AND LAY-OFFS# It
A19 0100 will be accomplished in two ways: _1._ A flat reduction of 10 per
A19 0110 cent in the salary of all officers, supervisors and other employees
A19 0120 not belonging to unions. There are about 3,325 officers and employees
A19 0130 in this class. _2._ Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to
A19 0140 bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense.   Since
A19 0150 the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members
A19 0160 under contract, it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some
A19 0170 of the men on furlough, a B&+O& spokesman said.   Those
A19 0180 union members kept on their jobs, therefore, will not take a cut in their
A19 0190 wages.   The spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot
A19 0200 be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending
A19 0210 on what men are most needed on the job.
A19 0220    A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night
A19 0230 after robbing him of $18 at Franklin and Mount streets.   The
A19 0240 victim, Norman B& Wiley, 38, of the 900 block North Charles street,
A19 0250 was treated for cuts at Franklin Square Hospital after the robbery.
A19 0260    The driver told police he followed as the Negro man got
A19 0270 out of the cab with his money. The victim was beaten when he attempted
A19 0280 to stop the bandit.   He said the assailant, who was armed
A19 0290 with a .45-caliber automatic, entered the taxi at Pennsylvania avenue
A19 0300 and Gold street.   In another attack, Samuel Verstandig, 41,
A19 0310 proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block Aiken street, told police
A19 0320 two Negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $150 from the cash
A19 0330 register after choking and beating him.
A19 0340    A baby was burned to death and two other children were seriously
A19 0350 injured last night in a fire which damaged their one-room Anne Arundel
A19 0360 county home.   The victim Darnell Somerville, Negro, 1,
A19 0370 was pronounced dead on arrival at Anne Arundel General Hospital
A19 0380 in Annapolis.   His sister and brother, Marie Louise, 3, and
A19 0390 John Raymond, Jr& 22 months, were admitted to the hospital. The
A19 0400 girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per cent of her body.
A19 0410 #BOY IN FAIR CONDITION# The boy received second-degree burns of
A19 0420 the face, neck and back. His condition was reported to be fair.
A19 0430    Police said the children's mother, Mrs& Eleanor Somerville,
A19 0440 was visiting next door when the fire occurred.   The house is
A19 0450 on Old Annapolis road a mile south of Severna Park, at Jones Station,
A19 0460 police said.
A19 0470 _ANNAPOLIS, JAN& 7_- The Anne Arundel county school superintendent
A19 0480 has asked that the Board of Education return to the practice
A19 0490 of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more
A19 0500 question about who said what.   The proposal was made by Dr&
A19 0510 David S& Jenkins after he and Mrs& D& Ellwood Williams,
A19 0515 Jr&,
A19 0520 a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent, argued
A19 0530 for about fifteen minutes at this week's meeting.   The disagreement
A19 0540 was over what Dr& Jenkins had said at a previous session
A19 0550 and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following
A19 0560 meeting. #CITES DISCREPANCIES# Mrs& Williams had a list which
A19 0570 she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory
A19 0580 of Dr& Jenkins's conversation and how they were written up for
A19 0590 the board's approval.   "I hate to have these things come
A19 0600 up again and again", Dr& Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion.
A19 0610 "These are the board's minutes. I'll write what you tell
A19 0620 me to".   For a number of years the board used a machine to
A19 0630 keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago.
A19 0640    It was about that time, a board member said later, that Dr&
A19 0645 Thomas G& Pullen, Jr&,
A19 0650 State superintendent of schools, told
A19 0660 Dr& Jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would
A19 0670 not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him.
A19 0680    The Board of County Commissioners, the Sanitary Commission,
A19 0690 the Planning and Zoning Board and other county official bodies
A19 0700 use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law
A19 0710 suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their
A19 0720 meetings.   Dr& Jenkins notes, however, that most of the
A19 0730 school boards in the State do not do so.
A19 0740    State Senator Joseph A& Bertorelli (D&, First Baltimore)
A19 0750 had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block
A19 0760 of West Pratt street.   He was taken to University Hospital
A19 0770 in a municipal ambulance.   Doctors at the hospital said he was
A19 0780 partially paralyzed on the right side. His condition was said to be,
A19 0790 "fair".   Police said he became ill while parked in front of
A19 0800 a barber shop at 229 West Pratt street. #BARBER SUMMONED# He called
A19 0810 Vincent L& Piraro, proprietor of the shop, who summoned police
A19 0820 and an ambulance.
A19 0830    The vice president of the City Council complained yesterday
A19 0840 that there are "deficiencies" in the city's snow clearing program
A19 0850 which should be corrected as soon as possible.   Councilman William
A19 0860 D& Schaefer (D&, Fifth) said in a letter to Mayor Grady
A19 0870 that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms
A19 0880 and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month. #WERNER
A19 0890 CRITICIZED# Conceding that several cities to the north were
A19 0900 in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm, Mr& Schaefer
A19 0910 listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here.
A19 0920    He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in December.
A19 0930 Equipment should be in operation "almost immediately after the
A19 0940 first snowfall", Mr& Schaefer said.   The Councilman,
A19 0950 who is the Administration floor leader, also criticized Bernard L&
A19 0960 Werner, public works director, for "halting snow operations" on
A19 0970 Tuesday night after the Sunday storm. #SENT HOME FOR REST# Mr&
A19 0980 Werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week.
A19 0990 What he did, Mr& Werner said, was let manual laborers go home Tuesday
A19 1000 night for some rest. Work resumed Wednesday, he said.
A19 1010 Mr& Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan,
A19 1020 under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to
A19 1030 use snow tires or chains on them, should be "strictly enforced".
A19 1040    Admitting that main streets and the central business district
A19 1050 should have priority, the Councilman said it is also essential that
A19 1060 small shopping areas "not be overlooked **h if our small merchants are
A19 1070 to survive".   Recounting personal observations of clearance
A19 1080 work, the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment
A19 1090 or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be
A19 1100 set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually
A19 1110 freezes.
A19 1120 _ANNAPOLIS, JAN& 7 (SPECIAL)_- The 15-year-old adopted son of
A19 1130 a Washington attorney and his wife, who were murdered early today in
A19 1140 their Chesapeake Bay-front home, has been sent to Spring Grove State
A19 1150 Hospital for detention.   The victims were H& Malone Dresbach,
A19 1160 47, and his wife, Shirley, 46. Each had been shot in the back
A19 1170 several times with a .22-caliber automatic rifle, according to Capt&
A19 1180 Elmer Hagner, chief of Anne Arundel detectives.   Judge
A19 1190 Benjamin Michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital
A19 1200 because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the Anne Arundel
A19 1210 County Jail. The Circuit Court jurist said the boy will have
A19 1220 a hearing in Juvenile Court.   #YOUNGER SON CALLS POLICE#
A19 1230 Soon after 10 A&M&, when police reached the 1-1/2-story brick
A19 1240 home
A19 1250 in the Franklin Manor section, 15 miles south of here on the bay, in
A19 1260 response to a call from the Dresbach's other son, Lee, 14, they
A19 1270 found Mrs& Dresbach's body on the first-floor bedroom floor. Her
A19 1280 husband was lying on the kitchen floor, police said.   The younger
A19 1290 son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings
A19 1300 and had driven away in their mother's car.   The description
A19 1310 of the car was immediately broadcast throughout Southern Maryland
A19 1320 on police radio. #TWO BROTHERS ADOPTED# Police said the boys
A19 1330 are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the Dresbachs.
A19 1340    Trooper J& A& Grzesiak spotted the wanted car,
A19 1350 with
A19 1360 three boys, at a Route 2 service station, just outside Annapolis. The
A19 1370 driver admitted he was the Dresbachs' son and all three were taken
A19 1380 to the Edgewater Station, police said.
A19 1390 _ANNAPOLIS, JAN& 7_- Governor Tawes today appointed Lloyd L&
A19 1400 Simpkins, his administrative assistant, as Maryland's Secretary
A19 1410 of State.   Mr& Simpkins will move into the post being vacated
A19 1420 by Thomas B& Finan, earlier named attorney general to succeed
A19 1430 C& Ferdinand Sybert, who will be elevated to an associate judgeship
A19 1440 on the Maryland Court of Appeals.   Governor Tawes announced
A19 1450 that a triple swearing-in ceremony will be held in his office
A19 1460 next Friday. #SIMPKINS FROM SOMERSET# Mr& Simpkins is a resident
A19 1470 of Somerset county, and he and the Governor, also a Somerset countian,
A19 1480 have been friends since Mr& Simpkins was a child.   Now
A19 1490 38, Mr& Simpkins was graduated from the University of Maryland's
A19 1500 College of Agriculture in 1947.   Five years later, he
A19 1510 was awarded the university's degree in law.   Mr& Simpkins
A19 1520 made a name for himself as a member of the House of Delegates from
A19 1530 1951 through 1958. From the outset of his first term, he established
A19 1540 himself as one of the guiding spirits of the House of Delegates.
A19 1550    MARYLAND contracts for future construction during October
A19 1560 totaled $77,389,000, up to 10 per cent compared to October, 1960, F&
A19 1570 W& Dodge, Dodge Corporation, reported.   Dodge reported
A19 1580 the following breakdown:   Nonresidential at $20,447,000, down
A19 1590 28 per cent; residential at $47,101,000, up 100 per cent; and
A19 1600 heavy engineering at $9,841,000, down 45 per cent.   The cumulative
A19 1610 total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted
A19 1620 to $634,517,000, a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding
A19 1630 period of last year.   A breakdown of the ten-month total
A19 1640 showed:   Nonresidential at $253,355,000, up 22 per cent; residential
A19 1650 at $278,877,000, up 12 per cent; and heavy engineering at
A19 1660 $102,285,000, down 33 per cent.   Residential building consists
A19 1670 of houses, apartments, hotels, dormitories and other buildings designed
A19 1680 for shelter.
A19 1690    The share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments, which
A19 1700 began about six years ago, has more than tripled within that span of
A19 1710 time.   In 1961, it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings
A19 1720 will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction.
A19 1730    While availability of mortgage money has been a factor
A19 1740 in encouraging apartment construction, the generally high level of
A19 1750 prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among
A19 1760 the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the
A19 1765 apartment-building
A19 1770 field.   Although economic and personal circumstances
A19 1780 vary widely among those now choosing apartments, Leo J& Pantas,
A19 1790 vice president of a hardware manufacturing company, pointed out recently
A19 1800 that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common:
A19 1810 a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems
A19 1820 involved in maintaining a house. #CONVENIENCE HELD KEY# "Convenience
A19 1830 is therefore the key to the housing market today. Trouble-free,
A19 1840 long-life, quality components will play an increasingly important
A19 1850 part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960", Pantas
A19 1860 predicted.
A19 1870    SIXTY-SEVEN living units are being added to the 165-unit
A19 1880 Harbor View Apartments in the Cherry Hill section.   Ultimately
A19 1890 the development will comprise 300 units, in two-story and three-story
A19 1900 structures. Various of the apartments are of the terrace type, being
A19 1910 on the ground floor so that entrance is direct. Others, which are
A19 1920 reached by walking up a single flight of stairs, have balconies.
A19 1930    The structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction.
A19 1940 Heating is by individual gas-fired, forced warm air systems.
A19 1960    CONSTRUCTION in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of
A19 1970 the gross national product, according to a study by Johns-Manville
A19 1980 Corporation.
A20 0010 _LONDON, FEB& 9_- Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic
A20 0020 submarine, the Dreadnought, and, by implication, of the entire United
A20 0030 States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet, were stolen by a
A20 0040 London-based soviet spy ring, secret service agents testified today.
A20 0050    The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United
A20 0060 States in 1959 and was launched last year. It is a killer sub- that
A20 0070 is, a hunter of enemy subs. It has a hull patterned on that of the
A20 0080 United States navy's Nautilus, the world's first atomic submarine.
A20 0090 Its power unit, however, was derived from the reactor of the more
A20 0100 modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack. #FIVE HELD FOR TRIAL#
A20 0110 The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen
A20 0120 was made in Bow st& police court here at the end of a three day
A20 0130 hearing. A full trial was ordered for:   Two British civil
A20 0140 servants, Miss Ethel Gee, 46, and her newly devoted friend, Harry
A20 0150 Houghton, 55, and divorced. They are accused of whisking secrets out
A20 0160 of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard.   Gordon A&
A20 0170 Lonsdale, 37, a mystery man presumed to be Russian altho he carries
A20 0180 a Canadian passport. When arrested, he had the submarine secrets
A20 0190 on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in
A20 0200 Christmas gift wrapping, it was testified. #FLASHED TO MOSCOW# A
A20 0210 shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger, bookseller, and wife,
A20 0220 Joyce.   [<In Washington, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
A20 0230 identified the Krogers as Morris and Lola Cohen, an American
A20 0240 couple formerly of New York City>.]   In their suburban
A20 0250 cottage the crown charges, the Krogers received secrets from the mystery
A20 0260 man, usually on the first Saturday evening of each month, and
A20 0270 spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to Moscow, either
A20 0280 on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted
A20 0290 over period marks in used books. Each dot on magnification resumed
A20 0300 its original condition as a drawing, a printed page, or a manuscript.
A20 0310    All five pleaded innocent. Only Miss Gee asked for bail.
A20 0320 Her young British lawyer, James Dunlop, pleaded that she was sorely
A20 0330 needed at her Portland home by her widowed mother, 80, her maiden
A20 0340 aunt, also 80 and bedridden for 20 years, and her uncle, 76, who once
A20 0350 ran a candy shop. #REFUSES TO GRANT BAIL# "I am not prepared to
A20 0360 grant bail to any of them", said the magistrate, K&J&P& Baraclough.
A20 0370    The trial will be held, probably the first week of
A20 0380 March, in the famous Old Bailey central criminal court where Klaus
A20 0390 Fuchs, the naturalized British German born scientist who succeeded
A20 0400 in giving American and British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and
A20 0410 thereby changed world history during the 1950s, was sentenced to 14 years
A20 0420 in prison.   Fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced
A20 0430 by the new five, who may have altered history in the 1960s. Fuchs,
A20 0440 after nine and a half years, was released, being given time off for good
A20 0450 behavior. He promptly went to communist East Germany.   The
A20 0460 magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29,000 in American
A20 0470 and British currency, mostly $20 bills, and in British government
A20 0480 bonds and stocks.   "This is Russian money", said Mervin Griffith-Jones
A20 0490 for the attorney general's office. He asserted that
A20 0500 the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow, Lonsdale the Red paymaster,
A20 0510 and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country's
A20 0520 secrets. #"OF HIGHEST VALUE"# The fact that secrets of
A20 0530 the Dreadnought, and thereby of the American undersea fleet, were involved
A20 0540 in the spy case had been hinted at earlier.   But just before
A20 0550 luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the British navy's
A20 0560 chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare, Capt& George
A20 0570 Symonds. He said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed
A20 0580 details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of
A20 0590 film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants
A20 0600 outside the Old Vic theater Saturday afternoon, Jan& 7.
A20 0610    The information, he said, would have been of the highest value to
A20 0620 a potential enemy. #COURT CLEARED# Just how many sub secrets were
A20 0630 being handed over when the ring, watched for six months, was broken
A20 0640 remained untold.   The British defending lawyers, who today increased
A20 0650 from three to four, demanded to know if they could make the information
A20 0660 involved seem of little value to a jury, the chances of their
A20 0670 clients would improve. So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared
A20 0680 the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate
A20 0690 for almost an hour.   Almost any information about the Dreadnought
A20 0700 would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet.
A20 0710 Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American
A20 0720 government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with
A20 0730 Britain that had been imposed after Fuchs blabbed. The United
A20 0740 States offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like
A20 0750 that used in the Skipjack.   With the machinery went a complete
A20 0760 design for the hull.   The Skipjack was a second generation
A20 0770 atomic sub, much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which preceded
A20 0780 it. #NAVY'S FUTURE INVOLVED# "Much of the navy's future
A20 0790 depends upon her", an American naval announcement said on the
A20 0800 Skipjack's first arrival in British waters in August, 1959, for exhibition
A20 0810 to selected high officers at Portland underwater research station.
A20 0820 It was there that the two accused civil servants were at work.
A20 0830    "Her basic hull form [a teardrop] and her nuclear power
A20 0840 plant will be used for almost all new submarines, including the potent
A20 0850 Polaris missile submarines", the statement went on.   The atom
A20 0860 reactor, water cooled, was the result of almost a decade of research
A20 0870 at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse
A20 0880 Electric Corp&. Thru development, the reactor and its
A20 0890 steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size, and also in complexity,
A20 0900 allowing a single propeller to be used, the navy said.   The
A20 0910 hull was also a result of almost a decade of work. It was first tried
A20 0920 out on a conventional submarine, the Albacore, in 1954.   The
A20 0930 Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built. Reputedly it could
A20 0940 outrun, underwater, the fastest destroyers. It could, reputedly, go
A20 0950 70,000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month.
A20 0960 It was of the hunter-killer type, designed to seek out ships and other
A20 0970 submarines with its most advance gear and destroy them with torpedoes.
A20 0980    The navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found
A20 0990 in Miss Gee's purse would, if completed and handed back, have
A20 1000 given the Kremlin a complete picture "of our current anti-submarine
A20 1010 effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development
A20 1020 for the future". #INTERESTED IN DETECTOR# The spy ring also
A20 1030 was particularly interested in ~ASDIC, the underwater equipment
A20 1040 for detecting submarines, it was testified. Range was a vital detail.
A20 1050 Designs of parts were sought.   Six radiomen told how, twice
A20 1060 on two days after the ring was nabbed, a transmitter near Moscow was
A20 1070 heard calling, using signals, times and wavelengths specified on codes
A20 1080 found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale's apartment and the
A20 1090 Krogers' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid. Oddly,
A20 1100 the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested.
A20 1110    The charge that the federal indictment of three Chicago narcotics
A20 1120 detail detectives "is the product of rumor, combined with malice,
A20 1130 and individual enmity" on the part of the federal narcotics unit here
A20 1140 was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge Joseph
A20 1150 Sam Perry in federal District court.   The three- Miles J&
A20 1160 Cooperman, Sheldon Teller, and Richard Austin- and eight other
A20 1170 defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate
A20 1180 federal narcotic laws.   In his opening statement to a jury
A20 1190 of eight women and four men, Bernard H& Sokol, attorney for the detectives,
A20 1200 said that evidence would show that his clients were "entirely
A20 1210 innocent". #'HAD TO KNOW PEDDLERS'# "When they became
A20 1220 members of the city police narcotics unit", Sokol said, "they were
A20 1230 told they would have to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which
A20 1240 narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in
A20 1250 the narcotics racket. They, on occasion, posed as addicts and peddlers".
A20 1260    Altho federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked
A20 1270 together, Sokol continued,
A20 1280 rivalries developed when they were "aiming
A20 1290 at the same criminals". This, he added, brought about "petty jealousies"
A20 1300 and "petty personal grievances".   "In the same
A20 1310 five year period that the United States says they [the detectives]
A20 1320 were engaged in this conspiracy", Sokol continued, "these three
A20 1330 young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special
A20 1340 compensations, and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the
A20 1350 mayor's medal". #NO COMMENTS BY U&S&# In opening, D&
A20 1360 Arthur Connelly, assistant United States attorney, read the indictment,
A20 1370 but made no comments. Attorneys for the eight other defendants
A20 1380 said only that there was no proof of their clients' guilt.
A20 1390 Cooperman and Teller are accused of selling $4,700 worth of heroin
A20 1400 to a convicted narcotics peddler, Otis Sears, 45, of 6934 Indiana av&.
A20 1410 Among other acts, Teller and Austin are accused of paying $800
A20 1420 to Sears.   The first witness, Moses Winston Mardis, 5835
A20 1430 Michigan av&, a real estate agent and former bail bondsman, took the
A20 1440 stand after opening statements had been made. But court adjourned after
A20 1450 he testified he introduced James White and Jeremiah Hope Pullings,
A20 1460 two of the defendants, and also introduced Pullings to Jessy
A20 1470 Maroy, a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted.
A20 1480    Buaford Robinson, 23, of 7026 Stewart av&, a ~CTA bus
A20 1490 driver, was slugged and robbed last night by a group of youths at 51st
A20 1500 street and South Park way. Robinson was treated at a physician's
A20 1510 office for a cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee.
A20 1520 His losses included his money bag, containing $40 to $50 and his $214
A20 1530 paycheck.   Robinson told Policemen James Jones and Morgan
A20 1540 Lloyd of the Wabash avenue district that 10 youths boarded his south
A20 1550 bound express bus in front of Dunbar Vocational High school, 30th
A20 1560 street and South Park way, and began "skylarking".   When
A20 1570 51st street was reached, Robinson related, he stopped the bus and told
A20 1580 the youths he was going to call the ~CTA supervisor. As he left
A20 1590 the bus with his money bag, Robinson added, the largest youth accosted
A20 1600 him, a quarrel ensued, and the youth knocked him down. Then the
A20 1610 youths fled with his money.
A20 1620    Mrs& Blanche Dunkel, 60, who has spent 25 years in the Dwight
A20 1630 reformatory for women for the murder in 1935 of her son-in-law, Ervin
A20 1640 Lang, then 28, appealed for a parole at a hearing yesterday before
A20 1650 two Illinois pardon and parole board members, John M& Bookwalter
A20 1660 and Joseph Carpentier. She had been sentenced to 180 years in
A20 1670 prison, but former Gov& Stratton commuted her term to 75 years, making
A20 1680 her eligible for parole, as one of his last acts in office.
A20 1690    Mrs& Dunkel admitted the slaying and said that the son-in-law became
A20 1700 her lover after the death of her daughter in 1934. It was when he
A20 1710 attempted to end the relationship that the murder took place.
A20 1720    The son of a wealthy Evanston executive was fined $100 yesterday
A20 1730 and forbidden to drive for 60 days for leading an Evanston policeman
A20 1740 on a high speed chase over icy Evanston and Wilmette streets Jan&
A20 1750 20.   The defendant, William L& Stickney /3, 23, of
A20 1760 3211 Park pl&, Evanston, who pleaded guilty to reckless driving, also
A20 1770 was ordered by Judge James Corcoran to attend the Evanston traffic
A20 1780 school each Tuesday night for one month.   Stickney is a salesman
A20 1790 for Plee-Zing, Inc&, 2544 Green Bay rd&, Evanston, a
A20 1800 food brokerage and grocery chain firm, of which his father, William L&
A20 1810 Jr&, is president.   Patrolman James F& Simms said
A20 1820 he started in pursuit when he saw young Stickney speeding north in Stewart
A20 1830 avenue at Central street.   At Jenks street, Simms said,
A20 1840 the car skidded completely around, just missed two parked cars, and
A20 1850 sped east in Jenks.   The car spun around again, Simms said,
A20 1860 before Stickney could turn north in Prairie avenue, and then violated
A20 1870 two stop lights as he traveled north into Wilmette in Prairie.
A21 0010 _ST& JOHNS, MICH&, APRIL 19._- A jury of seven men and five
A21 0020 women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday
A21 0030 in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs& Anna Hengesbach.   Pohl
A21 0040 received the verdict without visible emotion. He returned to his cell
A21 0050 in the county jail, where he has been held since his arrest last July,
A21 0060 without a word to his court-appointed attorney, Jack Walker, or his
A21 0070 guard. #STEPSON VINDICATED# The verdict brought vindication to
A21 0080 the dead woman's stepson, Vincent Hengesbach, 54, who was tried
A21 0090 for the same crime in December, 1958, and released when the jury failed
A21 0100 to reach a verdict. Mrs& Hengesbach was killed on Aug& 31, 1958.
A21 0110    Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since. When
A21 0120 the verdict came in against his young neighbor, Hengesbach said:
A21 0130    "I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed. Still,
A21 0140 I don't wish to appear happy at somebody's else's misfortune".
A21 0150 #LIVES ON WELFARE# Hengesbach, who has been living on welfare
A21 0160 recently, said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by
A21 0170 his grandfather in Westphalia, 27 miles southwest of here.   Hengesbach
A21 0180 has been living in Grand Ledge since his house and barn were
A21 0190 burned down after his release in 1958.   Pohl confessed the
A21 0200 arson while being questioned about several fires in the Westphalia area
A21 0210 by State Police.   He also admitted killing Mrs& Hengesbach.
A21 0220 However, the confession, which was the only evidence against him,
A21 0230 was retracted before the trial. #CHARGES IN DOUBT# Assistant Prosecutor
A21 0240 Fred Lewis, who tried both the Hengesbach and Pohl cases,
A21 0250 said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending
A21 0260 against Pohl.   Circuit Judge Paul R& Cash did not set
A21 0270 a date for sentencing. Pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison
A21 0280 or probation.   Walker said he was considering filing a motion
A21 0290 for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the
A21 0300 weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial
A21 0310 procedure. #LOCKED IN MOTEL# A verdict against Pohl came at 4:05
A21 0320 p&m& after almost 13-1/2 hours of deliberation. The jury, which
A21 0330 was locked up in a motel overnight, was canvassed at the request of
A21 0340 Walker after the verdict was announced.   The jury foreman, Mrs&
A21 0350 Olive Heideman, of rural Elsie, said that a ballot was not even
A21 0360 taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation
A21 0370 was spent in going over the evidence.   She said the jurors agreed
A21 0380 that Pohl's confession was valid.   The jury asked Judge
A21 0390 Cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first
A21 0400 and second-degree murder and manslaughter.   The verdict came
A21 0410 three hours later.   Some 30 spectators remained in the court during
A21 0420 the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read. The trial had
A21 0430 packed the large courtroom for more than a week.
A21 0440    A Sterling Township family of six surviving children, whose
A21 0450 mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire that also killed one
A21 0460 of the children, found today they had the help of hundreds of neighbors
A21 0470 and school friends.   While neighbor women assumed some of the
A21 0480 dead mother's duties, fund-raising events were being planned by a homeowners
A21 0490 association and a student council for the hard-hit Henry Kowalski
A21 0500 family, 34220 Viceroy.   Mrs& Eleanor Kowalski, 42,
A21 0510 died yesterday afternoon in Holy Cross Hospital of burns suffered
A21 0520 in a fire that followed a bottled gas explosion Saturday night at the
A21 0530 flat of her widowed mother, Mrs& Mary Pankowski, in the adjoining
A21 0540 suburb of Warren. #SERVICES TOMORROW# Funeral services for Mrs&
A21 0550 Kowalski and her daughter, Christine, 11, who died of burns at
A21 0560 the same hospital Monday, have been scheduled for 10 a&m& tomorrow
A21 0570 in St& Anne's Catholic Church, 31978 Mound, in Warren.
A21 0575    The
A21 0580 mother and daughter, who will be buried side by side in Mt& Olivet
A21 0590 Cemetery, rested together today in closed caskets at the Lyle Elliott
A21 0600 Funeral Home, 31730 Mound, Warren.   Mrs& Pankowski,
A21 0610 61, remained in Holy Cross Hospital as a result of the explosion,
A21 0620 which occurred while Mrs& Kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother's
A21 0630 small upstairs flat at 2274 Eight Mile road east. #HELD
A21 0640 CANDLE# Assistant Fire Chief Chester Cornell said gas fumes
A21 0650 apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three Kowalski
A21 0660 girls present held for her mother, because the flat lacked electricity.
A21 0670    Christine's twin sister, Patricia, and Darlene Kowalski,
A21 0680 8, escaped with minor burns. They are home now with the other Kowalski
A21 0690 children, Vicky, 14; Dennis, 6; Eleanor, 2; and Bernardine,
A21 0700 1.   "All we have left in the world is one another, and we
A21 0710 must stay together the way Mother wanted", Kowalski said in telling
A21 0720 his children of their mother's death yesterday afternoon.
A21 0730 Kowalski, a roofer who seldom worked last winter, already was in arrears
A21 0740 on their recently purchased split-level home when the tragedy staggered
A21 0750 him with medical and funeral bills. #$135 DONATED# Neighbor
A21 0760 women, such as Mrs& Sidney Baker, 2269 Serra, Sterling Township,
A21 0770 have been supplying the family with meals and handling household chores
A21 0780 with Kowalski's sister-in-law, Mrs& Anna Kowalski, 22111
A21 0790 David, East Detroit.   Another neighbor, Mrs& Frank C&
A21 0800 Smith, 2731 Pall Mall, Sterling Township, surprised Kowalski by
A21 0810 coming to the home yesterday with $135 collected locally toward the
A21 0820 $400 funeral costs.   John C& Houghton, president of the Tareytown
A21 0830 Acres Homeowners Association, followed that by announcing plans
A21 0840 last night for a door-to-door fund drive throughout their subdivision
A21 0850 on behalf of the Kowalski family. #STUDENTS HELP OUT# Houghton
A21 0860 said 6 p&m& Friday had been set for a canvass of all 480 homes
A21 0870 in the subdivision, which is located northeast of Dequindre and 14
A21 0880 Mile road east. He said contributions also could be mailed to Post
A21 0890 Office Box 553, Warren Village Station.   Vicky Kowalski
A21 0900 meanwhile learned that several of her fellow students had collected almost
A21 0910 $25 for her family during the lunch hour yesterday at Fuhrmann Junior
A21 0920 High School, 5155 Fourteen Mile road east.   Principal
A21 0930 Clayton W& Pohly said he would allow a further collection between
A21 0940 classes today, and revealed that ~Y-Teen Club past surpluses had
A21 0950 been used to provide a private hospital nurse Monday for Mrs& Kowalski.
A21 0960 #FUNDS FROM DANCES# Student Council officers announced
A21 0970 today the Kowalski family would be given the combined proceeds from
A21 0980 a school dance held two weeks ago, and another dance for Fuhrmann's
A21 0990 770 students this Friday night.   "Furhmann's faculty is proud
A21 1000 that this has been a spontaneous effort, started largely among the
A21 1010 students themselves, because of fondness for Vicky and sympathy for
A21 1020 her entire family, Pohly said.   There also were reports of a
A21 1030 collection at the County Line Elementary School, 3505o Dequindre,
A21 1040 which has been attended this year by four of the Kowalski children including
A21 1050 Christine. #EXPRESSES THANKS# Kowalski has spoken but
A21 1060 little since the fire last Saturday. But today he wanted to make a public
A21 1070 statement.   "I never knew there were such neighbors and
A21 1080 friends around me and my family. I wasn't sure there were such people
A21 1090 anywhere in the world. I'll need more than a single day to find
A21 1100 the words to properly express my thanks to them".
A21 1110    An alert 10-year-old safety patrol boy was congratulated by police
A21 1120 today for his part in obtaining a reckless driving conviction against
A21 1130 a youthful motorist.   Patrolman George Kimmell, of McClellan
A21 1140 Station, said he would recommend a special safety citation for
A21 1150 Ralph Sisk, 9230 Vernor east, a third grader at the Scripps School,
A21 1160 for his assistance in the case.   Kimmell said he and Ralph
A21 1170 were helping children across Belvidere at Kercheval Monday afternoon
A21 1180 when a car heading north on Belvidere stopped belatedly inside the
A21 1190 pedestrian crosswalk. #GETS CAR NUMBER# Kimmell ordered the driver
A21 1200 to back up, watched the children safely across and was approaching
A21 1210 the car when it suddenly "took off at high speed", he said, narrowly
A21 1220 missing him.   Commandeering a passing car, Kimmell pursued
A21 1230 the fleeing vehicle, but lost it in traffic. Returning to the school
A21 1240 crossing, the officer was informed by the Sisk boy that he recognized
A21 1250 the driver, a neighbor, and had obtained the license number.   The
A21 1260 motorist later was identified as Richard Sarkees, 17, of 2433 McClellan,
A21 1270 currently on probation and under court order not to drive.
A21 1280 #GIVEN 15 DAYS# He was found guilty of reckless driving yesterday
A21 1290 by Traffic Judge George T& Murphy, who continued his no-driving
A21 1300 probation for another year and ordered him to spend 15 days in the Detroit
A21 1310 House of Correction. The jail sentence is to begin the day
A21 1320 after Sarkees graduates from Eastern High School in June.
A21 1330    The long crisis in Laos appeared nearing a showdown today.
A21 1340    Britain announced that it is asking the Soviet Union to agree
A21 1350 tomorrow to an immediate cease-fire. #HELP ASKED# In Vientiane,
A21 1360 the royal Laotian government decided today to ask its "friends and
A21 1370 neighbors" for help in fighting what it called a new rebel offensive
A21 1380 threatening the southeast Asian kingdom.   Britain's plans
A21 1390 to press Russia for a definite cease-fire timetable was announced in
A21 1400 London by Foreign Secretary Lord Home.   He said Britain also
A21 1410 proposed that the international truce commission should be reconvened,
A21 1420 sent to New Delhi and from there to Laos to verify the cease-fire.
A21 1430    A 14-power conference on Laos should then meet on May 5,
A21 1440 he said. #PLEA FOR ARMS# The Laos government plea for help was
A21 1450 made by Foreign Minister Tiao Sopsaisana. He indicated that requests
A21 1460 would be made for more U&S& arms and more U&S& military
A21 1470 advisers.   He declared the government is thinking of asking
A21 1480 for foreign troops if the situation worsens.   One of the first
A21 1490 moves made after a cabinet decision was to request the United States
A21 1500 to establish a full-fledged military assistance group instead of the
A21 1510 current civilian body.   A note making the request was handed to
A21 1520 U&S& Ambassador Winthrop G& Brown. #HEAVY SUPPORT# The
A21 1530 Laos government said four major Pathet Lao rebel attacks had been
A21 1540 launched, heavily supported by troops from Communist North Viet Nam.
A21 1550    The minister, describing the attacks which led up to the
A21 1560 appeal, said that 60,000 Communist North Vietnamese were fighting royal
A21 1570 army troops on one front- near Thakhek, in southern-central Laos.
A21 1580    There was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent
A21 1590 sources. In the past such government claims have been found
A21 1600 exaggerated.
A21 1610 _HAVANA, APRIL 19._- Two Americans and seven Cubans were executed
A21 1620 by firing squads today as Castro military tribunals began decreeing
A21 1630 the death penalty for captured invasion forces and suspected collaborators.
A21 1640    A Havana radio broadcast identified the Americans
A21 1650 as Howard Anderson and August Jack McNair.   The executions
A21 1660 took place at dawn only a few hours after Havana radio announced their
A21 1670 conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at Pinar del Rio, where the
A21 1680 executions took place. #ARMS PLOT CHARGED# The broadcast said
A21 1690 Anderson, a Seattle ex-marine and Havana businessman, and McNair,
A21 1700 of Miami, were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to Cuban rebels.
A21 1710    Anderson operated three Havana automobile service stations
A21 1720 and was commander of the Havana American Legion post before it disbanded
A21 1730 since the start of Fidel Castro's regime.   Anderson's
A21 1740 wife and four children live in Miami.   McNair, 25, was seized
A21 1750 March 20 with four Cubans and accused of trying to land a boatload
A21 1760 of rifles in Pinar del Rio, about 35 miles from Havana. #REPORT
A21 1770 OTHERS HELD# At least 20 other Americans were reported to have
A21 1780 been arrested in a mass political roundup.   Among them were a
A21 1790 number of newsmen, including Henry Raymont, of United Press International,
A21 1800 and Robert Berrellez, of Associated Press.   So many
A21 1810 Cubans were reported being swept into the Castro dragnet that the
A21 1820 massive Sports Palace auditorium and at least one hotel were converted
A21 1830 into makeshift jails. More than 1,000 were said to have been arrested-
A21 1840 100 of them Roman Catholic priests.
A21 1850    Of the millions who have served time in concentration camps in
A21 1860 Siberia as political prisoners of the Soviet state, few emerge in the
A21 1870 West to tell about it.   M& Kegham- the name is a pseudynom-
A21 1880 was a teacher in Bucharest and a member of the Armenian Revolutionary
A21 1890 Federation (~ARF)- two reasons the Communists put
A21 1895 him
A21 1900 away when they arrived in 1945.   Today, M& Kegham was in Detroit,
A21 1910 en route to join his wife and children in California.
A22 0010    Emory University's Board of Trustees announced Friday that
A22 0020 it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state's
A22 0030 tax laws made such a step possible.   "Emory University's
A22 0040 charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of
A22 0050 students on the basis of race", board chairman Henry L& Bowden
A22 0060 stated.   But an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory
A22 0070 board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements
A22 0080 at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes.   The statement
A22 0090 explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law,
A22 0100 tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they
A22 0110 are segregated.   "Emory could not continue to operate according
A22 0120 to its present standards as an institution of higher learning, of
A22 0130 true university grade, and meet its financial obligations, without the
A22 0140 tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it
A22 0150 conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions",
A22 0160 the statement said.   The statement did not mention what steps
A22 0170 might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation.
A22 0180    An Emory spokesman indicated, however, that the university itself
A22 0190 did not intend to make any test of the laws.   The Georgia
A22 0200 Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from
A22 0210 property taxation if, among other criteria, "all endowments to institutions
A22 0220 established for white people shall be limited to white people,
A22 0230 and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall
A22 0240 be limited to colored people".   At least two private colleges
A22 0250 in the Atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student
A22 0260 bodies, but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the
A22 0270 state.   Emory is affiliated with the Methodist Church. Some
A22 0280 church leaders, both clerical and lay, have criticized the university
A22 0285 for not taking the lead in desegregation.
A22 0290 #URGED IN 1954# The student
A22 0300 newspaper, The Emory Wheel, as early as the fall of 1954 called
A22 0310 for desegregation.   "From its beginning", the trustees'
A22 0320 statement said Friday, "Emory University has assumed as its primary
A22 0330 commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian higher learning.
A22 0340 Teaching, research and study, according to highest standards, under
A22 0350 Christian influence, are paramount in the Emory University policy.
A22 0360    "As a private institution, supported by generous individuals,
A22 0370 Emory University will recognize no obligation and will adopt no
A22 0380 policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in
A22 0390 scholarship and Christian education.   "There is not now, nor
A22 0400 has there ever been in Emory University's charter or by-laws any
A22 0410 requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race,
A22 0420 color or creed. Insofar as its own governing documents are concerned,
A22 0430 Emory University could now consider applications from prospective
A22 0435 students, and others
A22 0440 seeking applications from prospective students,
A22 0450 and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university,
A22 0460 irrespective of race, color or creed. #CORPORATE EXISTENCE# "On
A22 0470 the other hand, Emory University derives its corporate existence from
A22 0480 the State of Georgia. **h   "When and if it can do so without
A22 0490 jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges
A22 0500 essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities,
A22 0510 Emory University will consider applications of persons desiring
A22 0520 to study or work at the University without regard to race, color or
A22 0530 creed, continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered
A22 0540 on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria
A22 0550 designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university
A22 0560 and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of Christian
A22 0570 higher education".
A22 0580    A young man was killed and two others injured at midnight Friday
A22 0590 when the car they were riding slid into a utility pole on Lake Avenue
A22 0600 near Waddell Street, ~NE, police said.   The dead youth
A22 0610 was identified as Robert E& Sims, 19, of 1688 Oak Knoll Cir&,
A22 0620 ~SE.   Patrolman G& E& Hammons said the car evidently
A22 0630 slid out of control on rain-slick streets and slammed into the
A22 0640 pole.   The other occupants were James Willard Olvey, 18, of
A22 0650 963 Ponce de Leon Ave&, ~NE, and Larry Coleman Barnett, 19,
A22 0660 of 704 Hill St&, ~SE, both of whom were treated at Grady Hospital
A22 0670 for severe lacerations and bruises.
A22 0680    The Atlanta Negro student movement renewed its demands for movie
A22 0690 theater integration Friday and threatened picketing and "stand-ins"
A22 0700 if negotiations failed.   The demands were set forth in
A22 0710 letters to seven owners of first-run theaters by the Committee on Appeal
A22 0720 for Human Rights. #'INTEND TO ATTEND'# "We intend to
A22 0730 attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year", the identically
A22 0740 worded letters said.   The letters set a Nov& 15 deadline
A22 0750 for the start of negotiations. They indicated that stand-ins and
A22 0760 picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate.
A22 0770    Downtown and art theater managers and owners, contacted Friday
A22 0780 night for comment on the ~COAHR request, said they had no knowledge
A22 0790 of such a letter, and that it was not in the Friday mail. However,
A22 0800 three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the
A22 0810 proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend. #GATHER
A22 0820 HERE# The ~COAHR letter comes on the eve of a large gathering
A22 0830 of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here Sunday.
A22 0840 Several theater operators said, however, that there is little likelihood
A22 0850 of the subject being discussed during the three-day affair.
A22 0860    Student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration
A22 0870 several months ago. Charles A& Black, ~COAHR chairman,
A22 0880 said Friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet
A22 0890 with the students on Oct& 31 but had failed to show up. He declined
A22 0900 to name the three.   Friday's letters asked for a Nov& 15
A22 0910 meeting. Failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend,
A22 0920 the letters said, would be considered a "sign of indifference".
A22 0930    Black said ~COAHR "hoped to be able to integrate the
A22 0940 theaters without taking direct action, but we are pledged to using every
A22 0950 legal and nonviolent means at our disposal **h"   A
A22 0960 prepared
A22 0970 statement released by the student group Friday stated that "extensive
A22 0980 research by ~COAHR into techniques and methods of theater
A22 0990 integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines
A22 0995 and stand-ins
A22 1000 before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits **h"
A22 1010    Besides managers of downtown theaters, the students sent
A22 1020 letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and Buckhead.
A22 1030 #R& E& KILLINGSWORTH# Raymond E& Killingsworth, 72, died
A22 1040 Sunday at his home at 357 Venable St&, ~NW.   Mr& Kililngsworth
A22 1050 was a foreman with ~S and ~W Cafeteria. He was born
A22 1060 in Pittsboro, Miss&, and was a veteran of World War /1,. He
A22 1070 was a member of the Baptist church.   Survivors include two brothers,
A22 1080 C& E& Killingsworth, Atlanta, and John Killingsworth,
A22 1090 Warren, Ohio; and two sisters, Miss Minnie Kililngsworth and
A22 1100 Mrs& Bessie Bloom, both of Gettysburg, Pa&. #JOHN W& BALL#
A22 1110 John William Ball, 68, of 133 Marietta St& ~NW, Apartment
A22 1120 101~B, died Sunday at his home.   Mr& Ball was a house
A22 1130 painter. He was a member of the Oakland City Methodist Church
A22 1140 and a native of Atlanta.   Funeral services will be at 2 p&m&
A22 1150 Tuesday at Blanchard's Chapel with the Rev& J& H& Hearn
A22 1160 officiating.   Survivors include his sister, Mrs& Emma
A22 1170 B& Odom of Atlanta. #MRS& LOLA HARRIS# Mrs& Lola M&
A22 1180 Harris, a native of Atlanta, died Sunday at her home in Garland,
A22 1190 Tex&.   Survivors include a son, Charles R& Fergeson, Memphis,
A22 1200 Tenn&; two daughters, Mrs& Gene F& Stoll and Miss
A22 1210 Nancy Harris, both of Garland; her father, H& T& Simpson,
A22 1220 Greenville, S&C&, and three sisters, Mrs& W& E& Little
A22 1230 and Mrs& Hal B& Wansley, both of Atlanta, and Mrs& Bill
A22 1240 Wallace, Wilmington, N&C&.
A22 1250    A 24-year-old Atlanta man was arrested Sunday after breaking
A22 1260 into the home of relatives in search of his wife, hitting his uncle with
A22 1270 a rock and assaulting two police officers who tried to subdue him,
A22 1280 police said.   Patrolmen J& W& Slate and A& L& Crawford
A22 1290 Jr& said they arrested Ronald M& Thomas, of 1671 Nakoma
A22 1300 St&, ~NW, after he assaulted the officers. #POLICE ACCOUNT#
A22 1310 The officers gave this account:   Thomas early Sunday went
A22 1320 to the home of his uncle and aunt, Mr& and Mrs& R& C& Thomas,
A22 1330 511 Blanche St&, ~NW, looking for his wife, Margaret Lou
A22 1340 Thomas, 18, and their 11-month-old baby.   The younger Thomas
A22 1350 ripped a screen door, breaking the latch, and after an argument struck
A22 1360 his uncle with a rock, scratching his face. He also struck his aunt
A22 1370 and wife, and during the melee the baby also suffered scratches.
A22 1380    When police arrived the man was still violent, Slate said. #ATTACKS
A22 1390 OFFICER# He attacked one of the officers and was restrained.
A22 1400 About five minutes later he jumped up, Slate said, and struck the
A22 1410 two policemen again.   He was then subdued and placed in the police
A22 1420 car to be taken to Grady Hospital for treatment of scratches received
A22 1430 in the melee. Then he attacked the two officers again and was again
A22 1440 restrained, Slate related.   Slate said he and Crawford received
A22 1450 cuts and scratches and their uniforms were badly torn.
A22 1460 Thomas was charged with four counts of assault and battery. Two counts
A22 1470 of assault on an officer, resisting arrest, disturbance and cursing,
A22 1480 police said. A hearing was set for 8:30 a&m& Tuesday.
A22 1490    Mrs& Mary Self, who knows more than any other person about
A22 1500 the 5,000 city employes for whom she has kept personnel records over
A22 1510 the years, has closed her desk and retired.   Over the weekend,
A22 1520 Mrs& Self, personnel clerk, was a feted and honored guest of the
A22 1530 Atlanta Club, organization of women employes at City Hall.
A22 1540 After 18 years in the personnel office, she has taken a disability pension
A22 1550 on advice of her doctors.   As personnel clerk, she handled
A22 1560 thousands of entries, ranging from appointments to jobs, to transfers
A22 1570 to other employments, to pensions.   "I have enjoyed it and
A22 1580 will feel a bit lost at least for a while", she said wistfully Friday.
A22 1590    One of the largest crowds in the club's history turned out
A22 1600 to pay tribute to Mrs& Self and her service.
A22 1610    Georgia's Department of Agriculture is intensifying its fire
A22 1620 ant eradication program in an effort to stay ahead of the fast-spreading
A22 1630 pest.   The department is planning to expand its eradication
A22 1640 program soon to four additional counties- Troup, Pierce, Bryan
A22 1650 and Bulloch- to treat 132,000 acres infested by the ants, according
A22 1660 to W& E& Blasingame state entomologist.   Low-flying planes
A22 1670 will spread a granular-type chemical, heptachlor, over 30,000 acres
A22 1680 in Troup, 37,000 acres in Pierce and 65,000 acres in Bulloch and
A22 1690 Bryan counties.
A22 1700    The eradication effort is being pushed in Bibb
A22 1710 and Jones counties, over 37,679 acres. The department has just finished
A22 1720 treating 20,000 acres in urban areas of Macon.   Also being
A22 1730 treated are Houston, Bleckley, Tift, Turner and Dodge counties,
A22 1740 Blasingame said. The fire ant is thought to infest approximately
A22 1750 two million acres of land in Georgia, attacking crops, young wildlife
A22 1760 and livestock and can be a serious health menace to humans who are allergic
A22 1770 to its venom, Blasingame said.
A22 1780    The north-bound entrance to the Expressway at 14th Street will
A22 1790 be closed during the afternoon rush traffic hours this week.
A22 1800 This is being done so that Georgia Tech can complete the final phase
A22 1810 of a traffic survey on the North Expressway. Students have been
A22 1820 using electric computers and high speed movie cameras during the study.
A22 1830 Perhaps the engineers can find out what causes all the congestion and
A22 1840 suggest methods to eliminate it.   Incidentally, 14th Street
A22 1850 and the Expressway is the high accident intersection during daylight
A22 1860 hours. It is followed by Cain Street and Piedmont Avenue, ~NE;
A22 1870 the junction of the Northeast and Northwest Expressways and Jones
A22 1880 Avenue and Marietta Street, ~NW.
A22 1890    Four persons died in Georgia weekend traffic crashes, two of
A22 1900 them
A22 1910 in a fiery crash near Snellville, the State Patrol said Sunday.
A22 1920    The latest death reported was that of 4-year-old Claude Douglas
A22 1930 Maynor of Calvary. Troopers said the child ran into the path
A22 1940 of a passing car a half-mile north of Calvary on Georgia 111 in Grady
A22 1950 County.   That death occurred at 6:50 p&m& Friday and
A22 1960 was reported Sunday, the patrol said. #BURSTS INTO FLAMES# An
A22 1970 auto overturned, skidding into a stopped tractor-trailer and burst into
A22 1980 flames near Snellville, the patrol said.   Bobby Bester Hammett,
A22 1990 21, of Rte& 3, Lawrenceville, and Mrs& Lucille Herrington
A22 2000 Jones, 23, of Lawrenceville, died in the flaming car, the patrol
A22 2010 said.
A23 0010 _SALEM (SPECIAL)_- For a second month in a row, Multnomah County
A23 0020 may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an
A23 0030 unusually high summer month's need, the state public welfare commission
A23 0040 was told Friday.   It is the only county in the state so
A23 0050 far this month reporting a possible shortage in ~GA category, for
A23 0060 which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary.
A23 0070    William Smythe, director of field service, told the commissioners
A23 0080 that Multnomah, as of Aug& 22, had spent $58,918 out of its budgeted
A23 0090 $66,000 in the category, leaving only $7,082 for the rest of the month.
A23 0100    At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the
A23 0110 month, this could mean a shortage of as high as $17,000. But it probably
A23 0120 will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of
A23 0130 each month, Smythe said. No request for emergency allotment had yet
A23 0140 been received, however. #BOARD OKS PACT# The commission, meeting
A23 0150 for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners, Roy
A23 0160 Webster, of Hood River, and Dr& Ennis Keizer, of North Bend,
A23 0170 approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing
A23 0180 department who has been the center of considerable controversy in
A23 0190 the past.   The contract with Ray Field, who has been converting
A23 0200 the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape, would
A23 0210 renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours
A23 0220 a month.   Field does the planning for the machine operations
A23 0230 and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to
A23 0240 new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes.
A23 0250    Acting Administrator Andrew F& Juras said that because
A23 0260 of Field's unique position and knowledge in the program, the
A23 0270 agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for
A23 0280 a period.   But he emphasized that the agency must train people
A23 0290 within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles, and he said he personally
A23 0300 "regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the
A23 0310 past".   He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency
A23 0320 was literally dependent now on the machine processing, "and the whole
A23 0330 wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four
A23 0340 persons directing it were to leave". #SALARY TERMED MODEST# Juras
A23 0350 said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant basis only
A23 0360 and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not
A23 0370 to other agencies of the government. He also said that the salary,
A23 0375 in
A23 0380 terms of going rates in the field, was "modest" in terms of the man's
A23 0390 responsibility. The conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed,
A23 0400 he said, and added Field's long service in state government
A23 0410 and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program.
A23 0420    "Do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and
A23 0430 defend this contract"? asked Mrs& Grace O& Peck, representative
A23 0440 from Multnomah County, of the commission chairman, Joseph E&
A23 0450 Harvey Jr&.   "My feeling at the moment", he said,
A23 0460 "is that we have no alternative, irrespective of some of the arguments
A23 0470 about him. The continued operation of this program depends on having
A23 0480 his service". #HARVEY CRITICIZED# Mrs& Peck, later joined
A23 0490 by the commission's vice-chairman, Mrs& Lee Patterson, took Harvey
A23 0500 to task for comments he had made to the North Portland Rotary
A23 0510 Club Tuesday.   A publicity release from Oregon Physicians
A23 0520 Service, of which Harvey is president, quoted him as saying the welfare
A23 0530 office move to Salem, instead of "crippling" the agency,
A23 0540 had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses, with the
A23 0550 key being improved communications between ~F+~A and the commission
A23 0560 staff.   "I rather resent", she said, "you speaking to
A23 0570 those groups in Portland as though just the move accomplished this.
A23 0580 **h I think you fell short of the real truth in the matter: That the
A23 0590 move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all
A23 0600 the people. **h The staff deserves a lot of credit working
A23 0610 down here under real obstacles".   Harvey said his objective
A23 0620 was to create a better public image for welfare".
A23 0630    The wife of convicted bank robber Lawrence G& Huntley was
A23 0640 arrested in Phoenix, Ariz&, last week and will be returned to Portland
A23 0650 to face charges of assault and robbery, Portland detectives said
A23 0660 Friday.   Mrs& Lavaughn Huntley is accused of driving the
A23 0670 getaway car used in a robbery of the Woodyard Bros&' Grocery,
A23 0680 2825 E& Burnside St&, in April of 1959.   Her husband,
A23 0690 who was sentenced to 15 years in the federal prison at McNeil Island
A23 0700 last April for robbery of the Hillsdale branch of Multnomah Bank,
A23 0710 also was charged with the store holdup. Secret Grand Jury indictments
A23 0720 were returned against the pair last week, Detective Murray Logan
A23 0730 reported.   The Phoenix arrest culminates more than a year's
A23 0740 investigation by Detective William Taylor and other officers. Taylor
A23 0750 said Mrs& Huntley and her husband also will be questioned about
A23 0760 a series of 15 Portland robberies in spring of 1959 in which the
A23 0770 holdup men bound their victims with tape before fleeing.   Mrs&
A23 0780 Huntley was held on $20,000 bond in Phoenix. She was arrested by
A23 0790 Phoenix Police after they received the indictment papers from Portland
A23 0800 detectives.
A23 0810    A 12-year-old girl, Susan Elaine Smith, 9329 ~NE Schuyler
A23 0820 St& was in serious condition Friday at Bess Kaiser Hospital,
A23 0830 victim of a bicycle-auto collision in the Gateway Shopping Center,
A23 0840 parking area, Deputy Sheriff W& H& Forsyth reported.
A23 0850    Funeral for William Joseph Brett, 1926 ~NE 50th Ave&,
A23 0860 who died Thursday in Portland, will be Monday 1 p&m& at the Riverview
A23 0870 Abbey.   Mr& Brett, born in Brooklyn, N&Y&,
A23 0880 Dec& 15, 1886, came to Portland in 1920. He owned a logging equipment
A23 0890 business here from 1923 to 1928, and later became Northwest district
A23 0900 manager for Macwhyte Co&. He retired in 1958.   Survivors
A23 0910 are his widow, Alice; a son, William, Seattle, Wash&; three
A23 0920 sisters, Mrs& Eugene Horstman, Los Angeles, Mrs& Lucy
A23 0930 Brett Andrew, New York City, and Mrs& Beatrice Kiefferm, New
A23 0940 York City, and five grandchildren.
A23 0950    Employes of Montgomery Ward + Co& at The Dalles, in a National
A23 0960 Labor Relations Board election Thursday voted to decertify
A23 0970 Local 1565, Retail Clerks International Association, ~AFL-~CIO,
A23 0980 as their collective bargaining agent.   The ~NLRB
A23 0990 said that of 11 potentially eligible voters eight voted against the
A23 1000 union, two voted for it, and one vote was challenged.
A23 1010    Monte Brooks, 67, theatrical producer and band leader, collapsed
A23 1020 and died Thursday in a Lloyd Center restaurant. He lived at 6124
A23 1030 N& Willamette Blvd&.   For many years he had provided
A23 1040 music and entertainment for functions throughout the Northwest. These
A23 1050 included Oregon State Fair, for which he had been booked on and off,
A23 1060 for 30 years.   He collaborated with many of the big name entertainers
A23 1070 visiting Portland, among the most recent being Jimmy Durante

A24 0010    About 70 North Providence taxpayers made appeals to the board
A24 0020 of tax accessors for a review of their 1961 tax assessments during the
A24 0030 last two days at the town hall in Centredale.   These were
A24 0035 the last
A24 0040 two days set aside by the board for hearing appeals. Appeals were heard
A24 0050 for two days two weeks ago. About 75 persons appeared at that time.
A24 0060    Louis H& Grenier, clerk of the board, said that the appeals
A24 0070 will be reviewed in December at the time the board is visiting new
A24 0080 construction sites in the town for assessment purposes. They also
A24 0090 will visit properties on which appeals have been made.   Any adjustments
A24 0100 which are made, Mr& Grenier said earlier this month, will
A24 0110 appear on the balance of the tax bill since most of the town's taxpayers
A24 0120 take the option of paying quarterly with the balance due next year.
A24 0140    John Pezza, 69, of 734 Hartford Avenue, Providence, complained
A24 0150 of shoulder pains after an accident in which a car he was driving
A24 0160 collided with a car driven by Antonio Giorgio, 25, of 12 DeSoto St&,
A24 0170 Providence, on Greenville Avenue and Cherry Hill Road in
A24 0180 Johnston yesterday.   Mr& Giorgio had started to turn left off
A24 0190 Greenville Avenue onto Cherry Hill Road when his car was struck
A24 0200 by the Pezza car, police said. Both cars were slightly damaged.
A24 0210    Mr& Pezza was taken to a nearby Johnston physician, Dr& Allan
A24 0220 A& DiSimone, who treated him. Mr& Giorgio was
A24 0230 uninjured.
A24 0240    Thieves yesterday ransacked a home in the Garden Hills section
A24 0250 of Cranston and stole an estimated $3,675 worth of furs, jewels,
A24 0260 foreign coins and American dollars.   Mr& and Mrs& Stephen
A24 0270 M& Kochanek reported the theft at their home on 41 Garden Hills
A24 0280 Drive at about 6 last night. They told police the intruders took a
A24 0290 mink coat worth $700, a black Persian lamb jacket worth $450; a wallet
A24 0300 with $450 in it; a collection of English, French and German
A24 0310 coins, valued at $500; four rings, a watch and a set of pearl earrings.
A24 0320    One of the rings was a white gold band with a diamond setting,
A24 0330 valued at $900. The others were valued at $325, $75 and $65. The
A24 0340 watch was valued at $125 and the earrings at $85.   The Kochaneks
A24 0350 told police they left home at 8 a&m& and returned about 5:45
A24 0360 p&m& and found the house had been entered. Patrolman Robert J&
A24 0370 Nunes, who investigated, said the thieves broke in through the back
A24 0380 door. Drawers and cabinets in two bedrooms and a sewing room were ransacked.
A24 0400    The city sewer maintenance division said efforts will be made
A24 0410 Sunday to clear a stoppage in a sewer connection at Eddy and Elm Streets
A24 0420 responsible for dumping raw sewage into the Providence River.
A24 0430    The division said it would be impossible to work on the line
A24 0440 until then because of the large amount of acid sewage from jewelry plants
A24 0450 in the area flowing through the line, heavy vehicle traffic on Eddy
A24 0460 Street and tide conditions.
A24 0470    A two-family house at 255 Brook Street has been purchased by
A24 0480 Brown University from Lawrence J& Sullivan, according to a deed
A24 0490 filed Monday at City Hall. F& Morris Cochran, university vice
A24 0500 president and business manager, said the house has been bought to provide
A24 0510 rental housing for faculty families, particularly for those here
A24 0520 for a limited time.
A24 0530    Employes of Pawtucket's garbage and rubbish collection contractor
A24 0540 picketed the firm's incinerator site yesterday in the second
A24 0550 day of a strike for improved wages and working conditions.   Thomas
A24 0560 Rotelli, head of Rhode Island Incinerator Service, Inc&, said
A24 0570 four of the company's eight trucks were making collections with
A24 0580 both newly hired and regular workers.   Sydney Larson, a staff
A24 0590 representative for the United Steel Workers, which the firm's 25
A24 0600 workers joined before striking, said the state Labor Relations Board
A24 0610 has been asked to set up an election to pick a bargaining agent.
A24 0620    A 62-year-old Smithfield man, Lester E& Stone of 19 Beverly
A24 0630 Circle, was in satisfactory condition last night at Our Lady of
A24 0640 Fatima Hospital, North Providence, with injuries suffered when a
A24 0650 car he was driving struck a utility pole on Woonasquatucket Avenue
A24 0660 in North Providence near Stevens Street.   Mr& Stone suffered
A24 0670 fractured ribs and chest cuts, hospital authorities said. He was
A24 0680 taken to the hospital by the North Providence ambulance.   Before
A24 0690 hitting the pole, Mr& Stone's car brushed against a car driven
A24 0700 by Alva W& Vernava, 21, of 23 Maple Ave&, North Providence,
A24 0710 tearing away the rear bumper and denting the left rear fender of
A24 0720 the Vernava car, police said. Mr& Vernava was uninjured.   The
A24 0730 impact with the utility pole caused a brief power failure in the immediate
A24 0740 area of the accident. One house was without power for about
A24 0750 half an hour, a Narragansett Electric Co& spokesman said. The power
A24 0760 was off for about five minutes in houses along Smith Street as far
A24 0770 away as Fruit Hill Avenue shortly before 5 p&m& when the accident
A24 0780 occurred.
A24 0790    The fight over the Warwick School Committee's appointment
A24 0800 of a coordinator of audio-visual education may go to the state Supreme
A24 0810 Court, it appeared last night.   Two members of the Democratic-endorsed
A24 0820 majority on the school board said they probably would vote
A24 0830 to appeal a ruling by the state Board of Education, which said yesterday
A24 0840 that the school committee acted improperly in its appointment of
A24 0850 the coordinator, Francis P& Nolan 3rd, the Democratic-endorsed
A24 0860 committee chairman, could not be reached for comment.   In its
A24 0870 ruling, the state Board of Education upheld Dr& Michael F& Walsh,
A24 0880 state commissioner of education, who had ruled previously that
A24 0890 the Warwick board erred when it named Maurice F& Tougas as coordinator
A24 0900 of audio-visual education without first finding that the school
A24 0910 superintendent's candidate was not suitable.   Supt& Clarence
A24 0920 S& Taylor had recommended Roger I& Vermeersch for the post.
A24 0940    Milton and Rosella Lovett of Cranston were awarded $55,000
A24 0950 damages from the state in Superior Court yesterday for industrial property
A24 0960 which they owned at 83 Atwells Ave&, Providence, and which
A24 0970 was condemned for use in construction of Interstate Route 95.
A24 0980    The award was made by Judge Fred B& Perkins who heard their
A24 0990 petition without a jury by agreement of the parties.   The award,
A24 1000 without interest, compared with a valuation of $57,500 placed on the
A24 1010 property by the property owners' real estate expert, and a valuation
A24 1020 of $52,500 placed on it by the state's expert.   The property
A24 1030 included a one-story brick manufacturing building on 8,293 square feet
A24 1040 of land.   Saul Hodosh represented the owners. Atty& Gen&
A24 1050 J& Joseph Nugent appeared for the state.
A24 1060    Santa's lieutenants in charge of the Journal-Bulletin Santa
A24 1070 Claus Fund are looking for the usual generous response this year
A24 1080 from Cranston residents.   Persons who find it convenient may send
A24 1090 their contributions to the Journal-Bulletin's Cranston office
A24 1100 at 823 Park Avenue. All contributed will be acknowledged.   The
A24 1110 fund's statewide quota this year is $8,250 to provide Christmas
A24 1120 gifts for needy youngsters. Scores of Cranston children will be remembered.
A24 1130    Cranston residents have been generous contributors to
A24 1140 the fund over the years. Public school children have adopted the fund
A24 1150 as one of their favorite Christmas charities and their pennies, nickels,
A24 1160 dimes and quarters aid greatly in helping Santa to reach the fund's
A24 1170 goal.
A24 1180    Bernard Parrillo, 20, of 19 Fletcher Ave&, Cranston, was
A24 1190 admitted to Roger Williams Hospital shortly before 11:30 a&m&
A24 1200 yesterday after a hunting accident in which a shotgun he was carrying
A24 1210 discharged against his heel.   Mr& Parrillo was given first
A24 1220 aid at Johnston Hose 1. (Thornton) where he had been driven by a companion.
A24 1230 The two had been hunting in the Simmonsville area of town
A24 1240 and Mr& Parrillo dropped the gun which fired as it struck the ground.
A24 1250    Hospital officials said the injury was severe but the youth
A24 1260 was in good condition last night.
A24 1270    A check for $4,177.37 representing the last payment of a $50,000
A24 1280 federal grant to Rhode Island Hospital was presented to the hospital
A24 1290 administrator, Oliver G& Pratt, yesterday by Governor Notte.
A24 1300    The hospital has used the money to assist in alterations on
A24 1310 the fifth floor of the Jane Brown Hospital, part of Rhode Island
A24 1320 Hospital. The work added eight beds to the hospital, giving it a total
A24 1330 capacity of 646 general beds.
A24 1340    Vincent Sorrentino, founder and board chairman of the Uncas
A24 1350 Mfg& Co&, has been designated a Cavaliere of the Order of Merit
A24 1360 of the Republic of Italy.   The decoration will be presented
A24 1370 by A& Trichieri, Italian consul general in Boston, at a ceremony
A24 1375 at 2:30 p& m& on Dec& 7
A24 1380 at the plant, which this year is celebrating
A24 1390 its golden anniversary. About 500 employes of the firm will be
A24 1400 on hand to witness bestowal of the honor upon Mr& Sorrentino.
A24 1410    Mr& Sorrentino will be honored on the evening of Dec& 7
A24 1420 at a dinner to be given by the Aurora Club at the Sheraton-Biltmore

A24 1440    The Newport-based destroyer picket escort Kretchmer has arrived
A24 1450 back at Newport after three months' patrol in North Atlantic
A24 1460 waters marked by mercy jobs afloat and ashore.   On Sept& 6,
A24 1470 the Kretchmer rescued the crew of a trawler they found drifting on a
A24 1480 life raft after they had abandoned a sinking ship. In August while stopping
A24 1490 in Greenock, Scotland, three members of the crew on liberty
A24 1500 rendered first aid to a girl who fell from a train. Local authorities
A24 1510 credited the men with saving the girl's life.
A24 1515 _BIRMINGHAM, ALA&- (~AP)_-
A24 1520 The ~FBI yesterday arrested
A24 1530 on a perjury charge one of the members of the jury that failed to reach
A24 1540 a verdict in the "Freedom Rider" bus burning trial four weeks
A24 1550 ago.   U&S& Attorney Macon Weaver said the federal complaint,
A24 1560 charged that the juror gave false information when asked about
A24 1570 Ku Klux Klan membership during selection of jury.   He identified
A24 1580 the man as Lewis Martin Parker, 59, a farmer of Hartselle,
A24 1590 Ala&.   Eight men were tried together in U&S& District
A24 1600 Court in Anniston, Ala&, on charges of interfering with interstate
A24 1610 transportation and conspiracy growing out of a white mob's attack
A24 1620 on a Greyhound bus carrying the first of the Freedom Riders. The
A24 1625 bus was
A24 1630 burned outside Anniston.   One of the eight defendants was
A24 1640 freed on a directed verdict of acquittal. A mistrial was declared in
A24 1650 the case against the other seven when the jury was unable to agree on
A24 1660 a verdict.   The arrest of Mr& Parker marks the third charge
A24 1670 of wrongdoing involving the jury that heard the case.   The first
A24 1680 incident occurred before the trial got under way when Judge H&
A24 1690 Hobart Grooms told the jury panel he had heard reports of jury-tampering
A24 1700 efforts.   He asked members of the panel to tell him if anyone
A24 1710 outside the court had spoken to them about the case. Two members
A24 1720 of the panel later told in court about receiving telephone calls at their
A24 1730 homes from anonymous persons expressing interest in the trial. Neither
A24 1740 was seated on the jury.   Then, when the case went to the
A24 1750 jury, the judge excused one of the jurors, saying the juror had told him
A24 1760 he had been accosted by masked men at his motel the night before the
A24 1770 trial opened. The juror said the masked men had advised him to be lenient.
A24 1780 The judge replaced the juror with an alternate.   No formal
A24 1790 charges have been filed as a result of either of the two reported
A24 1800 incidents.   At the opening of the trial, the jury panel was questioned
A24 1810 as a group by Mr& Weaver about Ku Klux Klan connections.
A24 1820    One member of the panel- not Mr& Parker- indicated
A24 1830 he had been a member of the ~KKK at one time. He was not seated
A24 1840 on the jury.   The perjury charge against Mr& Parker carries
A24 1850 a maximum penalty of $2,000 fine and five years imprisonment on conviction.
A24 1870 _NEW YORK- (~UPI)_- The New York University Board of
A24 1880 Trustees has elected the youngest president in the 130-year history

A25 0010 _ASILOMAR, MARCH 26_ Vast spraying programs conducted by "technicians
A25 0020 with narrow training and little wisdom" are endangering crops
A25 0030 and wildlife, Carl W& Buchheister, president of the National Audubon
A25 0040 Society, said today.   "It is like handing a loaded .45
A25 0050 automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play", he
A25 0060 commented.   Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon
A25 0070 Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy
A25 0080 its target, the fire ant.   "But it did destroy the natural
A25 0090 controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane
A25 0100 crop", he said.   The conservation leader said other mistakes
A25 0110 in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming. There
A25 0120 have even been serious errors in the U& S& Forest Service,
A25 0130 whose
A25 0140 officials pride themselves in their scientific training, he added.
A25 0150    "The news of their experiments reach the farmers who, forgetting
A25 0160 that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents,
A25 0170 are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally
A25 0180 peck their grapes or their blueberries", Buchheister told the delegates.
A25 0190    In addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying,
A25 0200 Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill, creation
A25 0210 of national seashore parks, including Point Reyes; preservation
A25 0220 of the wetlands where birds breed; a pesticides co-ordination act;
A25 0230 stronger water pollution control programs, and Federal ratification
A25 0240 of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by
A25 0250 oil.
A25 0260    The Reed Rogers Da Fonta Wild Life Sanctuary in Marin
A25 0270 county on Friday officially became the property of the National Audubon
A25 0280 Society.   Mrs& Norman Livermore, president of the Marin
A25 0290 Conservation League, handed over the deed to the 645-acre tidelands
A25 0300 tract south of Greenwood Beach to Carl W& Buchheister, president
A25 0310 of the Society.   The presentation was made before several
A25 0320 hundred persons at the annual meeting of the League at Olney Hall,
A25 0330 College of Marin, Kentfield.   Buchheister pledged the land
A25 0340 would be an "inviolate" sanctuary for all birds, animals and plants.
A25 0360    Seventeen years ago today, German scientist Willy Fiedler climbed
A25 0370 into a makeshift cockpit installed in a ~V-1 rocket-bomb that
A25 0380 was attached to the underbelly of a Heinkel bomber.   The World
A25 0390 War /2, German bomber rolled down a runway and took off.
A25 0400    The only way Fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the
A25 0410 pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip. This had never been done
A25 0420 before.   Now a quiet-spoken, middle-aged man, Fiedler is an
A25 0430 aeronautical engineer for Lockheed's Missiles and Space Division
A25 0440 at Sunnyvale, where he played a key role in the development of the
A25 0450 Navy's Polaris missile.   He sat in his office yesterday and
A25 0460 recalled that historic flight in 1944.   "The first two pilots
A25 0470 had crashed", he said. "I had developed the machines and therefore
A25 0480 knew them. It was time to go up myself".   Fiedler was then
A25 0490 technical director of Hitler's super-secret "Reichenberg project",
A25 0500 which remained unknown to the Allies until after the war.
A25 0510    About 200 of the special ~V-1 rocket-bombs were to be made ready
A25 0520 for manned flight with an explosive warhead. The target was Allied
A25 0530 shipping- a desperate effort to stave off the Allied invasion of
A25 0540 Europe.   The success of the project depended upon Fiedler's
A25 0550 flight.   Squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by
A25 0560 the rocket's automatic guidance mechanism, the scientist waited while
A25 0570 the bomber gained altitude.   At 12,000 feet, Fiedler signaled
A25 0580 "release", and started the roaring pulse-jet engine- then streaked
A25 0590 away from beneath the Heinkel.   To the German pilot in the
A25 0600 bomber the rocket became a faint black speck, hurtling through the
A25 0610 sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m&p&h&.   It was probably
A25 0620 man's first successful flight in a missile. "She flew beautifully",
A25 0630 said Fiedler. "There was only one power control- a valve
A25 0640 to adjust the fuel flow. I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to
A25 0650 the test strip".   Using a steering system that controlled the
A25 0660 modified rocket's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons,
A25 0670 Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the
A25 0680 fuselage.   He managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed
A25 0690 of 200 m&p&h&- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown-
A25 0700 and banked into the airfield.   Moments later the ~V-1 skimmed
A25 0710 across the landing strip, edging closer and closer to a touchdown-
A25 0720 then in a streamer of dust it landed.   Fiedler went on to make
A25 0730 several other test flights before German pilots took over the Reichenberg
A25 0740 missiles.   The missiles were to be armed with an underwater
A25 0750 bomb. Pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water,
A25 0760 striking below the waterline of individual ships.   A crack corps
A25 0770 of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers, but the project
A25 0780 was halted before the end of the war, and the missiles later fell into
A25 0790 Allied hands.   Now a family man with three children, Fiedler
A25 0800 lives in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant at Sunnyvale.
A25 0810 His spare time is spent in soaring gliders.   "It's
A25 0820 so quiet", he said, "so slow, serene- and so challenging".

A25 0990    In a letter to the American Friends Service, Dr& Schweitzer
A25 1000 wrote:   "Leading Nations of the West and of the East keep
A25 1010 busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event
A25 1020 the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out.   "They
A25 1030 cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons
A25 1040 imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack. The only
A25 1050 way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons;
A25 1060 otherwise no peace is possible.   "Governments apparently
A25 1070 do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger;
A25 1080 therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly
A25 1090 stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency".
A25 1110    A federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation
A25 1120 of the affairs of Ben Stein, 47, who collected big fees as
A25 1130 a "labor consultant" and operator of a janitors' service.
A25 1140 Before he testified for 20 minutes, Stein, who lives at 3300 Lake
A25 1150 Shore dr&, admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with
A25 1160 crime syndicate hoodlums. #GLIMCO A BUDDY# Among his gangland
A25 1165 buddies, he said, were
A25 1170 Joseph [Joey] Glimco, a mob labor racketeer,
A25 1180 and four gang gambling chiefs, Gus [Slim] Alex, Ralph Pierce,
A25 1190 Joe [Caesar] DiVarco, and Jimmy [Monk] Allegretti.
A25 1200 Another hoodlum, Louis Arger, drew $39,000 from Stein's janitor
A25 1210 firm, the National Maintenance company, in three years ending in 1959,
A25 1220 Stein disclosed in an interview.   "I put Arger on the payroll
A25 1230 because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at Navy
A25 1240 pier", Stein said. "But Arger never was able to produce it, so
A25 1250 I cut him off my payroll". #CONNECTION IS SOUGHT# Other witnesses,
A25 1260 after appearances before the jury, which reportedly is probing
A25 1270 into possible income tax violations, disclosed that government prosecutors
A25 1280 were attempting to connect Stein and his company with a number of
A25 1290 gangsters, including Glimco and Alex.   The federal lawyers,
A25 1300 according to their witnesses, also were tracing Stein's fees as a
A25 1310 labor consultant. Under scrutiny, two of the witnesses said, were payments
A25 1320 and loans to Stein's National Maintenance company at 543 Madison
A25 1330 st&.   The company supplies janitors and workmen for
A25 1335 McCormick
A25 1340 Place and factories, liquor firms, and other businesses. #LEE
A25 1350 A WITNESS# Among the witnesses were Ed J& Lee, director of
A25 1360 McCormick Place; Jerome Leavitt, a partner in the Union Liquor
A25 1370 company, 3247 S& Kedzie av&, Dominic Senese, a teamster union
A25 1380 slugger who is a buddy of Stein and a cousin of Tony Accardo, onetime
A25 1390 gang chief; and Frank W& Pesce, operator of a Glimco dominated
A25 1400 deodorant firm, the Best Sanitation and Supply company, 1215
A25 1410 Blue Island av&.   Lee said he had told the jury that he made
A25 1420 an agreement in April with Stein to supply and supervise janitors
A25 1430 in McCormick Place. Stein's fee, Lee said, was 10 per cent of
A25 1440 the janitors' pay. Stein estimated this amount at "about $1,500
A25 1450 or $1,600 a month". #A $12,500 PAYMENT# Leavitt, as he entered
A25 1460 the jury room, said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12,500
A25 1470 his liquor firm paid to Stein for "labor consultant work" with
A25 1480 five unions which organized Leavitt's workers. Leavitt identified
A25 1490 the unions as a warehouseman's local, the teamsters union, a salesman's
A25 1500 union, the janitors' union, and a bottling workers' union.
A25 1510    Government attorneys, Leavitt said, have questioned him closely
A25 1520 about "five or six loans" totaling about $40,000 which the liquor
A25 1530 company made to Stein in the last year.   All of the loans,
A25 1540 in amounts up to $5,000 each, have been repaid by Stein, according
A25 1550 to Leavitt. Stein said he needed the money, Leavitt said, to "meet
A25 1560 the payroll" at National Maintenance company.   The deodorant
A25 1570 firm run by Pesce has offices in the headquarters of Glimco's
A25 1580 discredited taxi drivers' union at 1213-15 Blue Island av&.
A25 1590    The radiation station of the Chicago board of health recorded
A25 1600 a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over
A25 1610 Chicago yesterday.   The reading, which has been watched
A25 1615 with
A25 1620 interest since Russia's detonation of a super bomb Monday, was 4
A25 1630 on Tuesday and 7 last Saturday, a level far below the danger point,
A25 1640 according to the board of health.   The weather bureau has estimated
A25 1650 that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week.
A25 1660 A board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that
A25 1670 an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation.
A25 1690    Curtis Allen Huff, 41, of 1630 Lake av&, Wilmette, was arrested
A25 1700 yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling
A25 1710 an undetermined amount of money from the First Federal Savings
A25 1720 and Loan association, 1 S& Dearborn st&, where he formerly
A25 1725 was employed
A25 1730 as an attorney.   Federal prosecutors estimated that the
A25 1740 amount may total $20,000, altho a spokesman for the association estimated
A25 1750 its loss at approximately $10,000. #LIEN PAYMENTS INVOLVED#
A25 1760 Huff's attorney, Antone F& Gregorio, quoted his client as saying
A25 1770 that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to Huff, as
A25 1780 attorney for the loan association, in satisfaction of mechanic's liens
A25 1790 on property on which the association held mortgages.   Huff told
A25 1800 Gregorio that he took the money to pay "the ordinary bills and
A25 1810 expenses of suburban living".   Huff, who received a salary of
A25 1820 $109 a week from the loan association from October of 1955 until September
A25 1830 of this year, said that his private practice was not lucrative.
A25 1840 Huff lives with his wife, Sue, and their four children, 6 to 10 years
A25 1850 old, in a $25,000 home with a $17,000 mortgage. #CHARGE LISTS 3
A25 1860 CHECKS# The complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by
A25 1870 Leo Blaber, an attorney for the association.   The shortage was
A25 1880 discovered after Huff failed to report for work on Sept& 18. On
A25 1890 that date, according to Gregorio, Huff left his home and took a room
A25 1900 in the New Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence av&. There, Gregorio
A25 1910 said, Huff wrote a complete statement of his offense.   Later,
A25 1920 Huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the Sherman House, using
A25 1930 a credit card. All bounced.   When Huff attempted to cash another
A25 1940 $100 check there Monday, hotel officials called police.
A25 1950 _BONN, OCT& 24 (~UPI)_- Greece and West Germany have ratified
A25 1960 an agreement under which Germany will pay $28,700,000 to Greek

A26 0010    PROBABLY THE hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment
A26 0020 community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue, which was
A26 0030 sold to the public during the past week.   For many reasons, the
A26 0040 demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous.
A26 0050 It was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the
A26 0060 stock; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers
A26 0070 and explaining to others why they had no more to sell.   Investors
A26 0080 who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25, and customers
A26 0090 who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100
A26 0100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many.   In fact, very
A26 0110 few customers, anywhere in the nation, were able to get more than 100
A26 0120 shares. Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares, for all of
A26 0130 their customers.   A measure of how hot the stock was, can be
A26 0140 found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began.
A26 0150    The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12.50 a share.
A26 0160 The first over-the-counter trade Wednesday afternoon at Eppler,
A26 0170 Guerin + Turner, the managing underwriter, was at $17 a share. And
A26 0180 from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading Thursday
A26 0190 morning at around $22 a share.   But the Morton Foods issue
A26 0200 was hot long before it was on the market. Indeed, from the moment the
A26 0210 reports of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas last
A26 0220 January, the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up.
A26 0230    Letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the
A26 0240 nation, all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would
A26 0250 be sold (185,000 to the public at $12.50, with another 5,000 reserved
A26 0260 for Morton Foods employes at $11.50 a share).   There was even
A26 0270 a cable in French from a bank in Switzerland that had somehow learned
A26 0280 about the Dallas stock offering. "We subscribe 500 shares of Morton
A26 0290 Foods of Texas. Cable confirmation", it said translated. But
A26 0300 E&G&T& could not let the Swiss bank have even 10 shares.
A26 0310    After it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group
A26 0320 members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone.
A26 0330    But the result of it all was, E&G&T& partner Dean Guerin
A26 0340 believes, an effective distribution of the stock to owners all
A26 0350 over the nation.   "I feel confident the stock will qualify for
A26 0360 the 'national list'", he said, meaning its market price would
A26 0370 be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country.   He was
A26 0380 also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved
A26 0390 again his argument that Dallas investment men can do just as good a
A26 0400 job as the big New York investment bankers claim only they can do.
A26 0405    But what made the Morton Foods stock issue such a hot one?
A26 0410    The answer is that it was a combination of circumstances.
A26 0420    First, the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last
A26 0430 few months, driving stocks of all kinds up. As a result, it is not
A26 0440 easy to find a stock priced as the Morton issue was priced (at roughly
A26 0450 10 times 1960 earnings, to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64~c
A26 0460 anticipated dividend).   Second, the "potato chip industry"
A26 0470 has caught the fancy of investors lately, and until Morton Foods
A26 0480 came along there were only two potato chip stocks- Frito and H&
A26 0490 W& Lay- on the market.   Both of those have had dynamic run-ups
A26 0500 in price on the market in recent months, both were selling at higher
A26 0510 price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was coming to market
A26 0520 at, and everyone who knew anything about it expected the Morton stock
A26 0530 to have a fast run-up.   And third, the potato chip industry has
A26 0540 taken on the flavor of a "growth" industry in the public mind of
A26 0550 late. Foods, which long had been considered "recession resistant"
A26 0560 but hardly dynamic stocks, have been acting like growth stocks, going
A26 0570 to higher price-earnings ratios.   The potato chip industry these
A26 0575 days is growing, not only as a
A26 0580 result of population increase and public
A26 0590 acceptance of convenience foods, but also because of a combination
A26 0595 of circumstances
A26 0600 that has led to growth by merger.   The history of the
A26 0610 U&S& potato chip industry is that many of today's successful
A26 0620 companies got started during the deep depression days. Those that remain
A26 0630 are those that were headed by strong executives, men with the abilities
A26 0640 to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest.
A26 0650    But today many of those men are reaching retirement age and
A26 0660 suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their
A26 0670 closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management
A26 0680 in their firms.   So they go looking for mergers with other
A26 0690 firms that have publicly quoted stock, and almost daily they pound on
A26 0700 the doors of firms like Frito.   All those things combined to
A26 0710 make the Morton Foods stock the hot issue that it was and is.
A26 0720    Now, if Morton's newest product, a corn chip known as Chip-o's,
A26 0730 turns out to sell as well as its stock did, the stock may turn out
A26 0740 to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up
A26 0750 to.
A26 0760 Dallas and North Texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and
A26 0770 distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies, valued in the
A26 0780 millions of dollars.   More than 10 companies maintain facilities
A26 0790 in Dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at
A26 0800 Sherman.   It is no coincidence that the Texas Cotton Ginner's
A26 0810 Association is meeting here this week for the 46th time in their
A26 0820 52-year history.   The exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at
A26 0830 the State Fair grounds is valued at more than a million dollars. It
A26 0840 weighs in the tons, so the proximity of factory and exhibition area
A26 0850 makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each year.   A modern
A26 0860 cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood of $250,000, and it's
A26 0870 a safe assumption that a large percentage of new gins in the U&S&
A26 0880 and foreign countries contain machinery made in this area.
A26 0890 The Murray Co& of Texas, Inc&, originated in Dallas in 1896.
A26 0900 They've occupied a 22-acre site since the early 1900's. More than
A26 0910 700 employes make gin machinery that's sold anywhere cotton is grown.
A26 0920    Murray makes a complete line of ginning equipment except
A26 0930 for driers and cleaners, and this machinery is purchased from a Dallas-based
A26 0940 firm.   The Continental Gin Co& began operations in
A26 0950 Dallas in 1899. The present company is a combination of several smaller
A26 0960 ones that date back to 1834.   Headquarters is in Birmingham,
A26 0970 Ala&. Factories are located here and in Prattville, Ala&.
A26 0975 About
A26 0980 40 per cent of the manufacturing is done at the Dallas plant by
A26 0990 more than 200 employes.   The company sells a complete line of
A26 1000 gin machinery all over the cotton-growing world.   Hardwicke-Etter
A26 1010 Co& of Sherman makes a full line of gin machinery and equipment.
A26 1020 The firm recently expanded domestic sales into the Southeastern
A26 1030 states as a result of an agreement with Cen-Tennial Gin Co&. They
A26 1040 export also.   The company began operation in 1900 with hardware
A26 1050 and oil mill supplies. In 1930, they began making cotton processing
A26 1060 equipment. Presently, Hardwicke-Etter employs 300-450 people, depending
A26 1070 on the season of the year.   The Lummus Cotton Gin Co&
A26 1080 has had a sales and service office in Dallas since 1912. Factory
A26 1090 operations are in Columbus, Ga&. The district office here employs
A26 1100 about 65.   The Moss Gordin Lint Cleaner Co& and Gordin
A26 1110 Unit System of Ginning have joint headquarters here. The cleaner
A26 1120 equipment firm began operations in 1953 and the unit system, which
A26 1130 turns out a complete ginning system, began operations in 1959.
A26 1140 Gordin manufacturing operations are in Lubbock.   The John E&
A26 1150 Mitchell Co& began work in Dallas in 1928. The firm is prominent
A26 1160 in making equipment for cleaning seed cotton, driers, and heaters,
A26 1170 and they lay claim to being the first maker (1910) of boil extraction
A26 1180 equipment.   The increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton makes
A26 1190 cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern gin operation.
A26 1200    Mitchell employs a total of about 400 people. They export cotton
A26 1210 ginning machinery.   The Hinckley Gin Supply Co& is a maker
A26 1220 of "overhead equipment". This includes driers, cleaners, burr
A26 1230 extractors, separators and piping that's located above gin stands in
A26 1240 a complete gin.   The firm began operations back in 1925 and sells
A26 1250 equipment in the central cotton belt, including the Mississippi
A26 1260 Delta.   The Cen-Tennial Gin Supply Co& has home offices
A26 1270 and factory facilities here. They make gin saws and deal in parts, supplies
A26 1280 and some used gin machinery.   The Stacy Co& makes cleaning
A26 1290 and drying equipment for sale largely in Texas. They've been
A26 1300 in Dallas since 1921.   Cotton Belt Gin Service, Inc&
A26 1310 of Dallas makes gin saws and started here 14 years ago. They distribute
A26 1320 equipment in 11 states. The firm also handles gin and oil mill supplies
A26 1330 such as belting, bearings, etc&.   Cotton processing equipment
A26 1340 is a sizable segment of Dallas business economy.
A26 1350 New car sales in Dallas County during March showed slight signs of
A26 1360 recovering from the doldrums which have characterized sales this year.
A26 1370    Registrations of new cars in Dallas County cracked the 3,000
A26 1380 mark in March for the first time this year.   Totaling 3,399,
A26 1390 sales jumped 14 per cent over February's 2,963. However, compared
A26 1400 with March 1960 new car sales of 4,441, this March was off 23 per
A26 1410 cent.   On a quarter-to-quarter comparison, the first quarter of
A26 1420 1961 total of 9,273 cars was 21 per cent behind the previous year's
A26 1430 3-month total of 11,744.   This year-to-year decline for Dallas
A26 1440 County closely follows the national trend- estimated sales of domestic
A26 1450 cars in the U&S& for first three months of 1961 were about
A26 1460 1,212,000 or 80 per cent of the total in the first quarter a year earlier.
A26 1470    With the March pickup, dealers are optimistic that the
A26 1480 April-June quarter will equal or top last year. The March gain plus
A26 1490 this optimism has been encouraging enough to prompt auto makers to boost
A26 1500 production schedules for the next quarter.   On the local level,
A26 1510 compacts continue to grab a larger share of the market at the expense
A26 1520 of lower-priced standard models and foreign cars. Only three standard
A26 1530 models- Buick, Chrysler, and Mercury- had slight year-to-year
A26 1540 gains in March sales in the county.
A26 1550    The top 3 students from 11 participating Dallas County high
A26 1560 schools will be honored by the Dallas Sales Executives Club at a banquet
A26 1570 at 6 p&m& Tuesday in the Sam Houston Room of the Sheraton-Dallas
A26 1580 Hotel as the club winds up its annual Distributive Education
A26 1590 project.   Now in its third year, the program is designed
A26 1600 to provide a laboratory for those youngsters seeking careers in marketing
A26 1610 and salesmanship. Business firms provide 20 weeks of practical employment
A26 1620 to supplement classroom instruction in these fields.   More
A26 1630 than 500 juniors and seniors are taking part in the program and 100
A26 1640 firms offer jobs on an educational rather than a need basis.
A26 1650 Principal address will be delivered by Gerald T& Owens, national
A26 1660 sales manager for Isodine Pharmical Corp& of New York.
A26 1670 The 33 honored students are: Mike Trigg, Raymond Arrington, and

A27 0010 _SANTA BARBARA_- "The present recovery movement will gather steady
A27 0020 momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn",
A27 0030 Beryl W& Sprinkel, economist of Harris Trust + Savings
A27 0040 Bank, Chicago, predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment
A27 0050 Bankers Assn&, California group, conference.   Another
A27 0060 speaker, William H& Draper, Jr&, former Under Secretary
A27 0070 of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper,
A27 0080 Gaither + Anderson, urged the U&S& to "throw down the
A27 0090 gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we won't be
A27 0100 pushed arouny any more". He urged support for President Kennedy's
A27 0110 requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations. #'NOT
A27 0120 FLASH IN PAN'# Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement
A27 0130 in economic activity was not a "temporary flash in the pan"
A27 0140 but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry
A27 0150 the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our
A27 0160 traditional growth pattern.   "In view of the current expansion,
A27 0170 which promises to be substantial" he said the odds appear to favor
A27 0180 rising interest rates in coming months, but "there is reason to
A27 0190 believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as
A27 0200 in late 1959 and 1960". #THESIS REFUTED# Sprinkel strongly refuted
A27 0210 the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of
A27 0220 limited and slow growth, declaring that this pessimism "is based
A27 0225 on
A27 0230 very limited and questionable evidence".   Rather than viewing
A27 0240 the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost
A27 0250 prospects for growth", he said "it should be viewed as a lesson
A27 0260 well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement
A27 0270 in this recovery". #DANGER CITED# He cautioned that "the
A27 0280 greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government
A27 0290 which could bring moderate inflation".   The economist
A27 0300 does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery
A27 0310 and believes it "even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will
A27 0320 aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn
A27 0330 as was the case in 1958".   The unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion,
A27 0340 he said, was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our
A27 0350 economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies
A27 0360 combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike.
A27 0370 #SACRIFICES NEEDED# Draper declared, "As I see it, this
A27 0380 country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today. We
A27 0390 must justify our heritage. We must be ready for any needed sacrifice".
A27 0400    He said that from his experience of two years with Gen&
A27 0410 Clay in West Berlin administration, that "Russia respects our show
A27 0420 of strength, but that presently we're not acting as we should and
A27 0430 must".   He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail
A27 0440 action, and noted that in war "you can't buy yourself out and
A27 0450 that's what we're trying to do".   While he declined to suggest,
A27 0460 how, he said that sooner or later we must get rid of Castro,
A27 0470 "for unless we do we're liable to face similar situations in this
A27 0480 hemisphere. Its the start of a direct threat to our own security and
A27 0490 I don't believe we can permit that".
A27 0500 _NEW YORK (~AP)_- {Stock market Tuesday staged a technical
A27 0510 recovery, erasing all of Monday's losses in the Associated Press
A27 0520 average and making the largest gain in about two weeks.}   Analysts
A27 0530 saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under
A27 0540 way late Monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for "support
A27 0550 level" represented by around 675 in the Dow Jones industrial
A27 0560 average. It was a level at which some of the investors standing on
A27 0570 the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented
A27 0580 in the averages. #SOME GOOD NEWS# Although it looked like a routine
A27 0590 technical snapback to Wall Streeters it was accompanied by some
A27 0610 good news. A substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable goods
A27 0620 was reported for last month.   Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon
A27 0630 said the economy is expected to advance by a whopping 8% next
A27 0640 year, paving the way for lower taxes.   The Dow Jones industrial
A27 0650 average advanced 7.19 to 687.87.   Of 1,253 issues traded, 695
A27 0660 advanced and 354 declined. New highs for the year totaled nine and
A27 0670 new lows 14.   Trading was comparatively dull throughout the day.
A27 0680 Volume dipped to 3.28 million shares from 3.98 million Monday.
A27 0690    A $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion economy was
A27 0700 envisioned for the 1970s here Tuesday by Peter G& Peterson, head
A27 0710 of one of the world's greatest camera firms, in a key address before
A27 0720 the American Marketing Assn&.   However, Peterson, president
A27 0730 of Bell + Howell, warned 800 U&S& marketing leaders attending
A27 0740 a national conference at the Ambassador, that the future will
A27 0750 belong to the industrialist of creative and "unconventional wisdom".
A27 0760 #CREATION'S NEEDED# "As we look to the $800 billion economy
A27 0770 that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer
A27 0780 expenditures that will be required to reach that goal, management
A27 0790 can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new
A27 0800 products will be created and marketed", Peterson said.   "With
A27 0810 this kind of new product log-jam, the premium for brilliant
A27 0815 product
A27 0820 planning will obviously go up geometrically".   The executive
A27 0830 paid tribute to research and development and technology for their
A27 0840 great contributions in the past, but he also cautioned industry that
A27 0850 they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace
A27 0860 within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which
A27 0870 it often needs. #NOTHING TO FEAR# Peterson said America has nothing
A27 0880 to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both
A27 0890 marketing and product ideas. He cited, as an example, how the American
A27 0900 camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition
A27 0910 of Japan despite lower Japanese labor costs, by improving its production
A27 0920 know-how and technology.   He also used as an example the
A27 0930 manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in Germany, with
A27 0940 the result that it became the best selling camera in the German
A27 0950 market.
A27 0960    Election of Howard L& Taylor to membership in Pacific Coast
A27 0970 Stock Exchange, effective Tuesday, has been announced by Thomas

A27 0990 and voting stockholder of Taylor and Co&, Beverly Hills, has been
A27 1000 active in the securities business since 1925.
A27 1010    Union Oil Co& of California Tuesday offered $120 million
A27 1020 in debentures to the public through a group of underwriters headed by
A27 1030 Dillon, Read + Co&, to raise money to retire a similar amount held
A27 1040 by Gulf Oil Corp&.   Gulf's holdings could have been converted
A27 1050 into 2,700,877 shares of Union Oil common upon surrender of
A27 1060 debentures plus cash, according to Union. Under the new offering, only
A27 1070 $60 million in debentures are convertible into 923,076 common shares.
A27 1080 #DUE IN 1986# The new offering Tuesday consisted of $60 million
A27 1090 worth of 4-7/8 debentures, due June 1, 1986, at 100%, and $60
A27 1100 million of 4-1/2% convertible subordinated debentures due June 1, 1991,
A27 1110 at 100%. The convertible debentures are convertible into common
A27 1120 shares at $65 a share by June 1, 1966; $70 by 1971; $75 by 1976;
A27 1130 $80 by 1981; $85 by 1986, and $90 thereafter.
A27 1140 _NEW YORK(~AP)_- American Stock Exchange prices enjoyed a fairly
A27 1150 solid rise but here also trading dwindled. Volume was 1.23 million
A27 1160 shares, down from Monday's 1.58 million. Gains of 2-3/4 were posted
A27 1170 for Teleprompter and Republic Foil. Fairchild Camera and Kawecki

A27 1190 _QUESTION_- I bought 50 shares of Diversified Growth Stock Fund
A27 1200 on Oct& 23, 1959, and 50 more shares of the same mutual fund on
A27 1210 Feb& 8, 1960. Something has gone wrong some place. I am getting
A27 1220 dividends on only 50 shares. In other words, I am getting only half
A27 1230 the dividends I should. _ANSWER_- Write to the fund's custodian
A27 1240 bank- the First National Bank of Jersey City, N&J&.
A27 1250 That bank handles most of the paper work for Diversified Growth Stock
A27 1260 Fund, Fundamental Investors, Diversified Investment Fund and
A27 1270 Television-Electronics Fund.   The bank installed a magnetic
A27 1280 tape electronic data processing system to handle things. But it seems
A27 1290 that this "electronic brain" wasn't "programmed" correctly.
A27 1300    This resulted in a great number of errors. And letters began
A27 1310 to come in to this column from irate shareholders.   I visited
A27 1320 the bank in March and wrote a story about the situation. At that time,
A27 1330 the people at the bank said they felt that they had the situation
A27 1340 in hand. They indicated that no new errors were being made and that all
A27 1345 old errors would be corrected
A27 1350 "within 60 days".   That 60-day
A27 1360 period is over and letters are still coming in from shareholders of
A27 1370 these four funds, complaining about mistakes in their accounts.
A27 1380 Maybe it's taking longer to get things squared away than the bankers
A27 1390 expected. Any shareholder of any of these funds who finds a mistake
A27 1400 in his account certainly should get in touch with the bank.   {Doyle
A27 1410 cannot undertake to reply to inquiries. He selects queries or
A27 1420 general interest to answer}.
A27 1430 _WASHINGTON (~AP)_- Alfred Hayes, president of the Federal
A27 1440 Reserve Bank of New York, said Tuesday "there is no present need
A27 1450 for far-reaching reforms" which would basically alter the international
A27 1460 financial system.   Hayes said that if a way can be found
A27 1470 to deal effectively with short-term capital movements between nations,
A27 1480 "there is no reason, in my judgment why the international financial
A27 1490 system cannot work satisfactorily for at least the foreseeable
A27 1500 future".
A27 1510 _WASHINGTON (~UPI)_- New York Central Railroad president Alfred
A27 1520 E& Perlman said Tuesday his line would face the threat of
A27 1530 bankruptcy if the Chesapeake + Ohio and Baltimore + Ohio Railroads
A27 1540 merge.   Perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect
A27 1550 of the merger, but could possibly be an ultimate effect.   The
A27 1560 railroad president made the statement in an interview as the Interstate
A27 1570 Commerce Commission opened Round 2 of its hearing into the ~C+~O's
A27 1580 request to control and then merge with the ~B+~O.
A27 1590    "All these kind of things weaken us", Perlman said. #BAD
A27 1600 CONDITION# Board Chairman Howard Simpson of the Baltimore + Ohio
A27 1610 Railroad Co&, testified the ~B+~O was in its worst financial
A27 1620 condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic
A27 1630 lift it would get from consolidation with the Chesapeake + Ohio Railroad.
A27 1640    "The financial situation of the Baltimore + Ohio,
A27 1650 has become precarious- much worse than at any time since the depression
A27 1660 of the 1930s", he told the hearing.   ~C+~O president
A27 1670 Walter J& Tuohy was summoned back for cross-examination by New
A27 1680 York Central attorneys before examiner John Bradford who is hearing
A27 1690 the complex case.   The New York Central also has asked the
A27 1700 ~ICC to permit it to gain control of the ~B+~O.   Central
A27 1710 was rebuffed by the other two railroads in previous attempts to
A27 1720 make it a three-way merger. The proposed ~C+~O-~B+~O railroad
A27 1730 would make it the hemisphere's second largest.
A27 1740 _WASHINGTON (~AP)_- The government's short-term borrowing costs
A27 1750 rose with Tuesday weekly offering of Treasury bills. On $1.1 billion
A27 1760 of 90-day bills, the average yield was 2.325%. The rate a week
A27 1770 ago was 2.295%.
A27 1780 _WASHINGTON, MARCH 11 (~UPI)._- "Consumer uncertain about economic
A27 1790 conditions".   This was the chief reason for a so-so sales
A27 1800 outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the National
A27 1810 Housing Center.   Other reasons mentioned by one-third or more
A27 1820 of the builders were "resistance to high interest rates, cost advantage
A27 1830 of buying over renting has narrowed, shelter market nearing saturation
A27 1840 and prospects unable to qualify". #INCREASE EXPECTED# The
A27 1850 poll was taken at the Center's annual builders' intentions conference.
A27 1860 It disclosed that the builders:   Expect their own production
A27 1870 volume, and presumably sales, to jump 30 percent in 1961.
A27 1880    Look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent
A27 1890 this year from 1960's 1,257,7000 non-farm housing starts. The industry
A27 1900 has said 1960 was a poor year. Starts were down 20 percent from
A27 1910 1959.   Why the discrepancy between the builders' forecasts for
A27 1920 themselves and for the industry? #LEADERS OF INDUSTRY# The
A27 1930 reason, says the Housing Center, is that the builders invited to the
A27 1940 intentions conference "are generally among the more successful businessmen,
A27 1950 and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders".
A28 0010 _ELBURN, ILL&_- Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back
A28 0020 in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales: "We've
A28 0030 sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for
A28 0040 10 more. We sold only four pickers all last year".   Gus Ehlers,
A28 0050 competitor of Mr& Houtz in this farm community, says his business
A28 0060 since August 1 is running 50% above a year earlier. "Before
A28 0070 then, my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20%",
A28 0080 he says.   Though the sales gains these two dealers are
A28 0090 experiencing are above average for their business, farm equipment sales
A28 0100 are climbing in most rural areas. Paradoxically, the sales rise is
A28 0110 due in large
A28 0120 measure to Government efforts to slash farm output. Although
A28 0130 the Administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point
A28 0140 since 1934, farmers, with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather,
A28 0150 are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced
A28 0160 to buy new harvesting machines. Fields of corn and some other crops
A28 0170 in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them
A28 0180 efficiently.
A28 0190 The higher price supports provided by the new legislation,
A28 0200 together with rising prices for farm products, are pushing up farm income,
A28 0210 making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery.
A28 0220    Seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery
A28 0230 say sales by their dealers since the start of August have shown
A28 0240 gains averaging nearly 10% above last year. "In August our dealers
A28 0250 sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in September
A28 0260 retail sales were 14% higher than last year", says Mark V&
A28 0270 Keeler, farm equipment vice president of International Harvester
A28 0280 Co&. For the year to date, sales of the company's farm equipment
A28 0290 dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960. #TWO OF THREE REPORT GAINS#
A28 0300 Among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states,
A28 0310 two out of three report their sales since August 1 show sizable gains
A28 0320 from a year earlier, with the increases ranging from 5% to 50%.
A28 0330 Not all sections are showing an upswing, however; the drought-seared
A28 0340 North Central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend.
A28 0350    The significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends
A28 0360 beyond the farm equipment industry. The demand for farm machinery
A28 0370 is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally. Farmers spend
A28 0380 more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group
A28 0390 of products. More than 20 million people live on farms and they own
A28 0400 a fourth of the nation's trucks, buy more gasoline than any other
A28 0410 industry and provide a major market for home appliances, chemicals and
A28 0420 other products.   Farmers are so eager for new machinery that
A28 0430 they're haggling less over prices than they did a year ago, dealers
A28 0440 report.   "Farmers aren't as price conscious as last year so
A28 0450 we can get more money on a sale", says Jack Martin, who sells J&
A28 0460 I& Case tractors and implements in Sioux City, Iowa. "This
A28 0470 morning, we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on
A28 0480 a new $2,700 model. Last year, we probably would have given him $700
A28 0490 for a comparable machine". Mr& Martin sold 21 tractors in August;
A28 0500 in August of 1960, he sold seven. #DEALERS' STOCKS DOWN#
A28 0510 With dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year
A28 0520 ago, the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately
A28 0530 by the country's farm equipment manufacturers. For example, farm
A28 0540 equipment shipments of International Harvester in August climbed
A28 0550 about 5% above a year earlier, Mr& Keeler reports.   Tractor
A28 0560 production at Massey-Ferguson, Ltd&, of Toronto in July and
A28 0570 August rose to 2,418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier,
A28 0580 says John Staiger, vice president.   With the lower dealer
A28 0590 inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there
A28 0600 could be shortages of some implements. Merritt D& Hill, Ford Motor
A28 0610 Co& vice president, says his company is starting to get calls
A28 0620 daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping
A28 0630 dates on orders for corn pickers.   Except for a few months
A28 0640 in late 1960 and early 1961, retail farm equipment sales have trailed
A28 0650 year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959. The rise in sales
A28 0660 last winter was checked when the Government's new feed grain program
A28 0670 was adopted; the program resulted in a cutback of around 20%
A28 0680 in
A28 0690 planted acreage and, as a result, reduced the immediate need for machines.
A28 0700    Nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers
A28 0710 say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement
A28 0720 in crop prospects. Total farm output for this year is officially
A28 0730 forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average, three points higher than
A28 0740 the July 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960.
A28 0750    The Government also is aiding farmers' income prospects. Agriculture
A28 0760 Department economists estimate the Government this year will
A28 0770 hand farmers $1.4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments,
A28 0780 well above the record $1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639
A28 0790 million of 1960. Price support loans may total another $1 billion
A28 0800 this year. With cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly
A28 0810 above 1960, farmers' gross income is estimated at $39.5 billion, $1.5
A28 0820 billion above 1960's record high. Net income may reach $12.7 billion,
A28 0830 up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953. The Government
A28 0840 reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers
A28 0850 rose in the month ended at mid-September for the third consecutive month,
A28 0860 reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-July.
A28 0880    {KENNEDY OPPOSES any widespread relief from a High Court
A28 0890 depletion ruling.}   The Supreme Court decision in mid-1960
A28 0900 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it
A28 0910 mined. The company, in figuring its taxable earnings, deducted a percentage
A28 0920 of the revenue it received for its finished products. Such "depletion
A28 0930 allowances", in the form of percentages of sales are authorized
A28 0940 by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their
A28 0950 assets. The High Court held that the company must apply its percentage
A28 0960 allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground,
A28 0970 not to the revenue from finished products.   A measure passed
A28 0980 by Congress just before adjourning softened the ruling's impact, on
A28 0990 prior-year returns still under review, for clay-mining companies that
A28 1000 make brick and tile products. The measure allows such companies in
A28 1010 those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the
A28 1020 value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay
A28 1030 alone.   <President Kennedy, in signing the relief measure
A28 1040 into law, stressed he regarded it as an exception. "My approval of
A28 1050 this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment
A28 1060 of similar legislation for other mineral industries", the President
A28 1070 said>. #@# {CHARITABLE DEDUCTIONS come in for
A28 1080 closer scrutiny by the I&R&S&.}   The Service announced
A28 1090 that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement
A28 1100 from the recipient organization showing the date, purpose, amount
A28 1110 and other particulars of the contribution. Requests for substantiation,
A28 1120 the Service indicated, can be especially expected in cases where
A28 1130 it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return, such
A28 1140 as tickets to a show.   In such instance, revenuers stressed,
A28 1150 the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received. #@#
A28 1160 {A RULE on the Federal deductibility of state taxes
A28 1170 is contested.}   A realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax
A28 1180 under Federal law, on its gain from the sale of property disposed
A28 1190 of in line with a plan of liquidation. Louisiana, however, collected
A28 1200 an income tax on the profits from the sale. The corporation, in filing
A28 1210 its final Federal income return, claimed the state tax payment as a
A28 1220 deductible expense, as permitted under U&S& tax law.   The
A28 1230 Revenue Service disallowed the claim, invoking a law provision that
A28 1235 generally bars deductions
A28 1240 for expenses incurred in connection with what
A28 1250 it said was tax-exempt income. The Tax Court rejected this view.
A28 1260 It said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the
A28 1270 exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations.

A28 1360 {THE OWNER} of a public relations firm owed no
A28 1370 income tax on payments he received from a client company and "kicked
A28 1380 back" to the company's advertising manager, the Tax Court ruled.
A28 1390 The taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had
A28 1400 to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager. The Court upheld
A28 1410 the taxpayer's contention that these "kickbacks" were not his
A28 1420 income though they passed through his hands. The Court limited its
A28 1430 decision to the tax issue involved, commenting: "It is not our province
A28 1440 to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction". #@#
A28 1450 {A PORTABLE KEROSENE RANGE} designed for use aboard boats
A28 1460 is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion
A28 1470 of the vessel. The Revenue Service said the addition of the attachment
A28 1480 does not keep the range from coming under the Federal manufacturers'
A28 1490 excise tax on household-type appliances. #@# {HIRING
A28 1500 THE WIFE for one's company may win her tax-aided retirement income}.
A28 1510    A spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls,
A28 1520 for example, may be entitled to distributions under the company's
A28 1530 pension plan as well as to her own Social Security coverage. She would
A28 1540 be taxed on the pensions when received, of course, but the company's
A28 1550 contributions would be tax-free.   A frequent pitfall in this
A28 1560 sort of arrangement, experts warn, is a tendency to pay the wife more
A28 1570 than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her
A28 1580 as retirement income. In that event, they note, the Revenue Service
A28 1590 might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges
A28 1600 under the law.   <Possible upshots: The company could
A28 1610 be denied a deduction for its pension payments, or those payments for
A28 1620 the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year

A28 1640 containing and bordering Denver authorized the imposition of an additional
A28 1650 2% sales tax within that area. Colorado has a 2% sales
A28 1660 tax. Denver itself collects a 1% sales tax which is to be absorbed
A28 1670 in the higher area tax **h. The Washington state supreme court ruled
A28 1680 that the state's occupation tax applied to sales, made at cost to an
A28 1690 oil company, by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain
A28 1700 supplies without divulging the identity of the parent. The state's
A28 1710 occupation tax is computed on gross sales. The court held that the tax
A28 1720 applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic
A28 1730 benefits by doing business as two separate entities.
A28 1740 _WASHINGTON_- Consumer spending edged down in April after rising
A28 1750 for two consecutive months, the Government reported.   The Commerce
A28 1760 Department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped
A28 1770 to slightly under $18 billion in April, down 1% from the March
A28 1780 level of more than $18.2 billion. April sales also were 5% below
A28 1790 those of April last year, when volume reached a record for any month,
A28 1800 $18.9 billion (see chart on Page One).   The seasonal adjustment
A28 1810 takes into account such factors as Easter was on April 2 this
A28 1820 year, two weeks earlier than in 1960, and pre-Easter buying was pushed
A28 1830 into March.   Commerce Department officials were inclined to
A28 1840 explain the April sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer
A28 1850 buying in March. Adjusted sales that month were up a relatively
A28 1860 steep 2.5% from those of the month before, which in turn were slightly
A28 1870 higher than the January low of $17.8 billion.
A29 0010    Greer Garson world-famous star of stage, screen and television,
A29 0020 will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion
A29 0030 with which she has created a high standard in her profession.
A29 0040    As a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss Garson
A29 0050 is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion
A29 0060 this season. She will receive the 1961 "Oscar" at the 24th annual
A29 0070 Neiman-Marcus Exposition, Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand
A29 0080 Ballroom of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel. ## {THE ONLY WOMAN}
A29 0090 recipient, Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando
A29 0100 Sarmi, creator of chic, beautiful women's fashions; Harry Rolnick,
A29 0110 president of the Byer-Rolnick Hat Corporation and designer
A29 0120 of men's hats; Sydney Wragge, creator of sophisticated casuals
A29 0130 for women and Roger Vivier, designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris,
A29 0140 France, whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized
A29 0150 the shoe industry.   The silver and ebony plaques will be presented
A29 0160 at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus, president of Neiman-Marcus,
A29 0170 Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas
A29 0180 Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center.
A29 0190    The attractive Greer Garson, who loves beautiful clothes
A29 0200 and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles, prefers
A29 0210 timeless classical designs. Occasionally she deserts the simple
A29 0220 and elegant for a fun piece simple because "It's unlike me". ##
A29 0230 {IN PRIVATE LIFE}, Miss Garson is Mrs& E& E&
A29 0240 Fogelson and on the go most of the time commuting from Dallas,
A29 0245 where
A29 0250 they maintain an apartment, to their California home in Los Angeles'
A29 0260 suburban Bel-Air to their ranch in Pecos, New Mexico. Therefore,
A29 0270 her wardrobe is largely mobile, to be packed at a moment's notice
A29 0280 and to shake out without a wrinkle.   Her creations in fashion
A29 0290 are from many designers because she doesn't want a complete wardrobe
A29 0300 from any one designer any more than she wants "all of her pictures
A29 0310 by one painter". ## {A FAVORITE} is Norman Norell,
A29 0320 however. She likes his classic chemise. Her favorite cocktail dress
A29 0330 is a Norell, a black and white organdy and silk jersey.   Irene
A29 0340 suits rate high because they are designed for her long-bodied silhouette.
A29 0345 She also likes the femininity
A29 0350 and charm of designs by Ceil Chapman
A29 0360 and Helen Rose.   Balenciaga is her favorite European
A29 0370 designer.   "I bought my first dress from him when I was still
A29 0380 a struggling young actress", she reminisces. "I like his clothes
A29 0390 for their drama and simplicity and appreciate the great impact he has
A29 0400 on fashion". ## {BLACK AND WHITE} is her favorite color
A29 0410 combination along with lively glowing pinks, reds, blues and greens.
A29 0420    Of Scotch-Irish-Scandinavian descent, Greer Garson was
A29 0430 born in County Down, Ireland. Her mother was a Greer and her father's
A29 0440 family came from the Orkney Isles.   Reared in England,
A29 0450 she studied to be a teacher, earned several scholarships and was graduated
A29 0460 with honors from the University of London. She took postgraduate
A29 0470 work at the University of Grenoble in France and then returned
A29 0480 to London to work on market research with an advertising firm. ##
A29 0490 {HER ACTING} began with the Birmingham Repertory Company
A29 0500 and she soon became the toast of the West End. Among stage performances
A29 0510 was a starring role in "Golden Arrow" directed by Noel
A29 0520 Coward. It was during "Old Music" at the St& James Theater
A29 0530 that Hollywood's Louis B& Mayer spotted her.   After
A29 0540 signing a motion-picture contract, she came to America and had "Goodbye,
A29 0550 Mr& Chips" as her first assignment after a year's wait.
A29 0560 Other triumphs include "Random Harvest", "Madame Curie",
A29 0570 "Pride and Prejudice", "The Forsythe Saga" and "Mrs&
A29 0580 Miniver" (which won her the Academy Award in 1943). ## {HONORS}
A29 0590 that have come to Greer Garson are countless. Just this
A29 0600 April she was nominated for the seventh time for an Academy Award
A29 0610 for her portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt in "Sunrise at Campobello".
A29 0620 She gave a fine portrayal of Auntie Mame on Broadway in 1958
A29 0630 and has appeared in live television from "Captain Brassbound's
A29 0640 Conversion" to "Camille". She is in Madame Tussard's Waxworks
A29 0650 in London, a princess of the Kiowa tribe and an honorary colonel
A29 0660 in many states.   She is adept at skeet shooting, trout fishing,
A29 0670 Afro-Cuban and Oriental dancing and Southwestern archaeology.
A29 0680 She now serves on the board of directors of the Dallas Symphony
A29 0690 Orchestra and the Dallas Theater Center and on the board of trustees
A29 0700 of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts. She is state chairman for
A29 0710 the New Mexico Tuberculosis and Cancer Associations. Both Miss
A29 0720 Garson and her oilman-rancher husband are active supporters of Boys
A29 0730 Clubs of America and patrons of the vivid art and opera colony that
A29 0740 flourishes in New Mexico.
A29 0750    Back in college, today's handsome Gander was the only male
A29 0760 member of a Texas Tech class on food. The pretty coeds must have ogled
A29 0770 him all day long- but he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy.
A29 0780    Last October he gave a public speech in Washington, D&C&
A29 0790 entitled "Are Women Here to Stay"? So you can see that Gerald
A29 0800 G& Ramsey, director of ~SMU's food services, is not the
A29 0810 ordinary type of craven, women-trodden chef. He is apt to rear back
A29 0820 and claim his rights. ## {RAMSEY}, as ~SMU's food
A29 0830 wrangler, buys enough groceries to serve 32,000 meals a week. Tell
A29 0840 that to the little wife when she moans at the woman's burden!
A29 0850    He also dishes up 3,000 snacks. And he operates three cafeterias
A29 0860 in the Student Center, along with McElvaney Dining Hall and the
A29 0870 athlete's tables.   Ramsey, 6-3, 195 and ruggedly slim, says,
A29 0880 "I can't remember when I didn't pester my mother to teach me
A29 0890 to cook". ## {HE WAS IN CHARGE} of the Hockaday School
A29 0900 meals from 1946 to 1950, before he moved to ~SMU. And you'll
A29 0910 notice that in both places, there are acres of charming young ladies
A29 0920 who with little effort spice up any chow line.   What does he feed
A29 0930 his ~SMU football mastodons at the training table?   "Mostly
A29 0940 meat and potatoes- they have to have that go-go-go without
A29 0950 getting too fat", says Ramsey. So he hides the mayonnaise. And to
A29 0960 keep athletes' stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress,
A29 0970 he bans all highly flavored condiments. ## {WHAT DO} the
A29 0980 pretty ~SMU girls like on their plates?   "Pretty much
A29 0990 hamburger, hotdogs, steak and, at night, maybe pizza", says the handsome
A29 1000 food expert. "Unfortunately, there is still little demand for
A29 1010 broccoli and cauliflower".   Ramsey has stoked up Harry Truman,
A29 1020 Henry Cabot Lodge, the King of Morocco, Clement Atlee and
A29 1030 other shiny characters. Once four Tibetan monks, in their saffron robes,
A29 1040 filed through the cafeteria line.   "They aren't supposed
A29 1050 to look at women, you know", Ramsey recalled. "What with all
A29 1060 those pretty girls around, they had a hard time". #CHICKEN CADILLAC#
A29 1070 Use one 6-ounce chicken breast for each guest. Salt and pepper
A29 1080 each breast. Dip in melted butter and roll in flour. Place side by
A29 1090 side in a 2-inch deep baking pan. Bake slowly about one hour at 250-275
A29 1100 F& until lightly brown.   Add enough warmed cream, seasoned
A29 1110 to taste with onion juice, to about half cover the chicken breasts.
A29 1120 Bake slowly at least one-half hour longer.   While this is baking,
A29 1130 saute mushrooms, fresh or canned, in butter. Sprinkle over top
A29 1140 of chicken breasts. Serve each breast on a thin slice of slow-baked ham
A29 1150 and sprinkle with Thompson seedless grapes.   (Leave off the
A29 1160 ham and you call it Chicken Pontiac, says Ramsey.)
A29 1170    Contemporary furniture that is neither Danish nor straight-line
A29 1180 modern but has sculptured pattern, many design facets, warmth, dignity
A29 1190 and an effect of utter comfort and livability.   That is the
A29 1200 goal of two new collections being introduced in Dallas this month.
A29 1210    Though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary
A29 1220 furniture might go back to the boxy look of the '20's and '40's,
A29 1230 two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated,
A29 1240 but warm look in contemporary. These two, Heritage and Drexel,
A29 1250 chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece,
A29 1260 but a collection of correlated designs, each of which could stand alone.
A29 1270    The Heritage collection, to be shown by Sanger-Harris and
A29 1280 Anderson's Studio, has perhaps more different types of woods and
A29 1290 decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one
A29 1300 time. Called Perennian, to indicate its lasting, good today and tomorrow
A29 1310 quality, the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces.
A29 1320    Walnut, wormy chestnut, pecan, three varieties of burl,
A29 1330 hand-woven Philippine cane, ceramic tiles, marble are used to emphasize
A29 1340 the feeling of texture and of permanence, the furniture to fit into
A29 1350 rooms with tiled floors, brick or paneled walls, windows that bring
A29 1360 in the outdoors. It is a collection with a custom-design look, offering
A29 1370 simplicity with warmth, variety and vitality.   The Drexel collection,
A29 1380 called Composite, to be shown by Titche's offers a realistic
A29 1390 approach to decorating, a mature modern that is a variation of many
A29 1400 designs.   Rounded posts give a soft, sculptured look, paneled
A29 1410 doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches,
A29 1420 table tops are inlaid in Macassar ebony or acacia. A high-legged
A29 1430 buffet provides easy-to-reach serving, a cocktail table has small snack
A29 1440 tables tucked under each end, recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch
A29 1450 long chest.   An interesting approach to the bedroom is presented,
A29 1460 with a young, basic, functional group of chests, dressers and
A29 1470 corner units and a canted headboard. The other bedroom has heavier styling,
A29 1480 door-fronted dressers with acacia panels, a poster bed or a bed
A29 1490 with arched acacia panels and matching mirror.   Colorful, bright
A29 1500 Eastman Chromspun fabrics, with the magenta, pink and white tones
A29 1510 predominating as well as golden shades are used with Composite. The
A29 1520 fabrics have Scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles.
A29 1530 Design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite
A29 1540 contemporary label keynote Drexel's fall 1961 group, Composite.
A29 1550 The spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony, to
A29 1560 set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top. See-through design of
A29 1570 the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an Oriental shoji
A29 1580 flavor. To bring warmth to the dining area, golden orange tones
A29 1590 are used in the fabrics.   Dignity and comfort, in a contemporary
A29 1600 manner, reflecting the best aspects of today's design, with substance
A29 1610 and maturity, keynote the Perennian collection from Heritage. Center
A29 1620 panel, hand-screened wood, actually is a back of one of the tall
A29 1630 bookcases. Mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper
A29 1640 and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the Alexander
A29 1650 Smith carpet in all wool loop pile.
A29 1660    The Vagabonds are "on the road" again. Members are on their
A29 1670 way to Saledo, not by stage coach, but in air-conditioned cars.
A29 1680    This coming weekend they have reserved the entire Stagecoach Inn
A29 1690 and adjoining country club, Saledo, for festivities. Invitations
A29 1700 have been extended to some Austin dignitaries including Gov& and
A29 1710 Mrs& Price Daniel.   Stagecoach Days is the theme for the
A29 1720 weekend on the Old Chisholm Trail. ## {THE GET-TOGETHER}
A29 1730 Friday night will be a banquet at the country club patio and pool,
A29 1740 and an orchestra will play for dancing.   Guests will wear costumes
A29 1750 typical of the Chisholm Trail Days. Ginghams and calico will
A29 1760 be popular dress for the women. The men will be in western attire,
A29 1770 including Stetsons and colored vests. ## {DECORATING}
A29 1780 the ballroom
A29 1790 will be the yellow rose of Texas, in tall bushes; bluebonnets
A29 1800 and stagecoach silhouettes. There will be a large drawing of a sunbonnet
A29 1810 girl with eyes that flash at the guests.   Mr& and Mrs&
A29 1820 Phil G& Abell are chairmen for the Saledo trip. Committee members
A29 1830 aiding them in planning the entertainment are ~Messrs and ~Mmes
A29 1840 Roy McKee, George McElyee, Jack Fanning, W& H& Roquemore
A29 1850 and Joe Darrow. ## {THE TRAVEL CLUB} is comprised of
A29 1860 75 fun-loving couples who have as their motto "Go Somewhere, Anywhere,
A29 1870 Everywhere". Their activities will be climaxed in the spring
A29 1880 of 1962 when they go to Europe.   In the past, the men and women
A29 1890 have chartered planes to Las Vegas and Jamaica, buses to Mineral
A29 1900 Wells and Kerrville and private railway coaches to Shreveport and
A29 1910 Galveston.   Four parties are given a year. Two of these are
A29 1920 in or near Dallas and the others away from the vicinity.   Serving
A29 1930 on the club's board are ~Mmes R& P& Anderson, president;
A29 1940 A& F& Schmalzried, secretary; W& H& Roquemore,
A29 1950 treasurer, and the following chairmen: ~Mmes McKee, publicity;
A29 1960 Lawrence B& Jones, yearbook, and Sam Laughlin, scrapbook.
A30 0010    A cooky with caramel filling and chocolate frosting won $25,000
A30 0020 for a Minneapolis housewife in the 13th annual Pillsbury Bake-Off
A30 0030 Tuesday.   Mrs& Alice H& Reese, wife of an engineer and
A30 0040 mother of a 23-year-old son, was awarded the top prize at a luncheon
A30 0050 in the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Mrs& Reese entered 10 past bake-offs
A30 0060 before she got into the finals.   Second grand prize
A30 0070 of $5,000 went to Mrs& Clara L& Oliver for her Hawaiian coffee
A30 0080 ring, a rich yeast bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze. #MOTHER
A30 0090 OF FIVE# Mrs& Oliver is mother of five children and wife
A30 0100 of a machinist. She lives in Wellsville, Mo&.   Mrs& Reese
A30 0110 baked her cookies for only the third time in the Bake-off finals.
A30 0120 And the third time was the charm.   She dreamed up the cooky recipe,
A30 0130 tried it, liked it and entered it in the contest. The second baking
A30 0140 was for photographing when told she was a finalist. The third time
A30 0150 was on the floor of the Beverly Hilton ballroom and for the critical
A30 0160 eyes and tongues of judges.
A30 0170    Mr& and Mrs& Joseph R& Bolker will give a dinner
A30 0180 on Friday at their home in Beverly Hills to honor Mrs& Norman Chandler,
A30 0190 chairman of the Music Center Building Fund Committee, and
A30 0200 Mr& Chandler.   Mr& Bolker heads a group within the building
A30 0210 and development industry to raise funds in support of this cultural
A30 0220 center for the performing arts.   A feature of the party will
A30 0230 be a presentation by Welton Becket, center architect, of color slides
A30 0240 and renderings of the three-building complex. #FOLIAGE WILL GLOW
A30 0250 AT FORMAL FALL PARTY# Fall foliage and flowers will decorate Los
A30 0260 Angeles Country Club for the annual formal party Saturday evening.
A30 0270 More than 200 are expected at the autumn event which is matched in
A30 0280 the spring.   Among those with reservations are Messrs& and
A30 0290 Mmes& William A& Thompson, Van Cott Niven, A& B& Cox,
A30 0300 David Bricker, Samuel Perry and Robert D& Stetson.
A30 0310 Others are Drs& and Mmes& Alfred Robbins, and J& Lafe Ludwig
A30 0320 and Gen& and Mrs& Leroy Watson. #GUESTS FROM ACROSS U&S&
A30 0330 HONOR DR& SWIM# When Dr& W& A& Swim celebrated his
A30 0340 75th birthday at the Wilshire Country Club, guests came by chartered
A30 0350 plane from all over the country.   A flight originating in
A30 0360 Florida picked up guests on the East Coast and Midwest and a plane
A30 0370 left from Seattle taking on passengers at West Coast points.
A30 0380    Cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more than 100 persons
A30 0390 who had known Dr& Swim when he practiced in Los Angeles. He started
A30 0400 practice in 1917, and served on the State Board of Medical Examiners.
A30 0420    Giving up the violin opened a whole new career for Ilona Schmidl-Seeberg,
A30 0430 a tiny Hungarian who Fritz Kreisler had predicted would
A30 0440 have a promising career on the concert stage.   A heart attack
A30 0450 when she was barely 20 put an end to the 10-hour daily practicing.
A30 0460 She put the violin away and took out some linen, needles and yarn to
A30 0470 while away the long, idle days in Budapest.   Now her modern tapestries
A30 0480 have been exhibited on two continents and, at 26, she feels she
A30 0490 is on the threshold of a whole new life in Los Angeles.   Her
A30 0500 days as an art student at the University of Budapest came to a sudden
A30 0510 end during the Hungarian uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband
A30 0520 Stephen fled to Vienna.   There they continued their studies
A30 0530 at the university, she in art, he in architecture. And there she had
A30 0540 her first showing of tapestry work.
A30 0550    There's a lot of talk about the problem of education in America
A30 0560 today. What most people don't seem to realize, if they aren't
A30 0570 tied up with the thing as I am, is that 90% of the problem is transportation.
A30 0580    I never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved
A30 0590 until, at long last, both of my boys got squeezed into high school.
A30 0600 It seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the
A30 0610 hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint
A30 0620 at the grammar school.   Getting to and from school was no
A30 0630 problem. They either walked or were driven. #@# Now they go to
A30 0640 a high school that is two miles away. One might think the problem would
A30 0650 be similar. They could walk, ride on a bus or be driven.
A30 0660 It's much more complex than that. Generally, they go to school with
A30 0670 a girl named Gloriana, who lives down the block, and has a car.
A30 0680    This is a way of getting to school, but, I understand, it entails
A30 0690 a certain loss of social status. A young man doesn't like to be driven
A30 0700 up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn't even
A30 0710 in a higher class than he is, and is also a girl.   "Why don't
A30 0720 you walk to school then"? I suggested. "My father walked,
A30 0730 through two miles of snow, in Illinois".   "Did you"?
A30 0740 I was asked.   "No", I said, "I didn't happen to grow
A30 0750 up in Illinois".   I explained, however, that I had my share
A30 0760 of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom. #@#
A30 0770 I had to ride a streetcar two miles. Sometimes the streetcar
A30 0780 was late. Sometimes there weren't even any seats. I had to stand
A30 0790 up, with the ladies. Sometimes I got on the wrong car and didn't get
A30 0800 to school at all, but wound up at the ocean, or some other dismal place,
A30 0810 and had to spend the day there.   I've tried to compromise
A30 0820 by letting them take the little car now and then. When they do that
A30 0830 my wife has to drive me to work in the big car. She has to have at
A30 0840 least one car herself. I feel a certain loss of status when I am driven
A30 0850 up in front of work in a car driven by my wife, who is only a woman.
A30 0860    Even that isn't satisfactory. If they have to take any car,
A30 0870 they'd rather take the big one. They say that when they take a
A30 0880 car, Gloriana doesn't take her car, but rides with them. But when
A30 0890 Gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually
A30 0900 ride with her, so the little car isn't big enough. #@# The
A30 0910 logic of that is impeccable, of course, except that I feel like a
A30 0920 fool being driven up to work in a little car, by my wife, when everybody
A30 0930 knows I have a big car and am capable of driving myself.   The
A30 0940 solution, naturally, is the bus. However, it's a half-mile walk
A30 0950 down a steep hill from our house to the bus, and it's too hard on my
A30 0960 legs.   My wife could drive us down the hill and we could all
A30 0970 walk
A30 0980 from there. But that's hardly realistic.   Nobody walks any
A30 0990 more but crackpots and Harry Truman, and he's already got an education.
A30 1010    Advance publicity on the Los Angeles Blue Book does not mention
A30 1020 names dropped as did the notices for the New York Social Register

A30 1500    HERE'S an idea for a child's room that is easy to execute
A30 1510 and is completely charming, using puppets for lamp bases. Most children
A30 1520 love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies, and
A30 1530 they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action, rather than
A30 1540 put away in boxes. Displayed as lamps, the puppets delight the children
A30 1550 and are decorative accent.   To create such a lamp, order
A30 1560 a wired pedestal from any lamp shop. Measure the puppet to determine
A30 1570 the height of the light socket, allowing three to four inches above the
A30 1580 puppet's head. Make sure that the metal tube through which the wire
A30 1590 passes is in the shape of an inverted "~L", the foot of the
A30 1600 "~L" about three inches long, so that the puppet can hang directly
A30 1610 under the light. #PULLING STRINGS# Using the strings that manipulate
A30 1620 the puppet, suspend him from the light fixture by tying the
A30 1630 strings to the lamp base. In this way, you can arrange his legs and arms
A30 1640 in any desired position, with feet, or one foot, barely resting on
A30 1650 the pedestal. If the puppets are of uniform size, you can change them
A30 1660 in accord with your child's whims.   Although a straight drum
A30 1670 shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could
A30 1680 be changed without disharmony, it is far more fun to create shades
A30 1690 in the gay spirit of a child's playtime. Those illustrated are reminiscent
A30 1700 of a circus top or a merry-go-round. The scalloped edge is particularly
A30 1710 appealing.
A30 1720    TODAY'S trend toward furniture designs from America's
A30 1730 past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the
A30 1740 shrewd cabinetmakers of our Colonial era.   A generation ago
A30 1750 there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions.
A30 1760 In the background lurked the feeling, however, that these pieces,
A30 1770 beautiful as they were, lacked the utilitarian touch. So junior's
A30 1780 bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy, nondescript pieces that
A30 1790 supposedly could take the "hard knocks", while the fine secretary
A30 1800 was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only.   This
A30 1810 isn't true of the many homemakers of the 1960's, according to decorator
A30 1820 consultant, Leland Alden.   Housewives are finding literally
A30 1830 hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs,
A30 1840 says Mr& Alden and they are doing it largely because Colonial
A30 1850 craftsmen had "an innate sense of the practical". #SOLID INVESTMENT#
A30 1860 There are a number of reasons why the Eighteenth Century
A30 1870 designer had to develop "down to earth" designs- or go out of
A30 1880 business.

A31 1150    Is there anything a frustrated individual can do about Communism's
A31 1160 growing threat on our doorstep and around the world?
A31 1170 More than 300 teenagers last Sunday proved there is and as many more
A31 1180 are expected to prove it again for Jim Kern and his wife Lynn from
A31 1190 4 to 8 p&m& Sunday at First Presbyterian Church.   At that
A31 1200 time the second half of the Christian Youth Crusade against Communism
A31 1210 will be staged. {A young real estate salesman, Kern first
A31 1220 got seriously interested in the problems posed by Communism when in the
A31 1230 Navy Air Force. He was particularly struck by a course on Communist
A31 1240 brainwashing}.   Kern began reading a lot about the history
A31 1250 and philosophy of Communism, but never felt there was anything
A31 1255 he,
A31 1260 as an individual, could do about it.   When he attended the Christian
A31 1270 Anti-Communist Crusade school here about six months ago,
A31 1280 Jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive
A31 1300 in the ideological battle and set out to do it.   The best approach,
A31 1310 he figured, was to try to influence young people like the high
A31 1320 schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at First Presbyterian Church.
A31 1330    {And he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn
A31 1340 about Communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote-
A31 1350 a Biblically strong Christianity}.   So the Christian
A31 1360 Youth Crusade against Communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers
A31 1370 and 65 adult advisers from Presbyterian churches of the area sat
A31 1380 enthralled at the four-hour program.   This Sunday those attending
A31 1390 the second session will hear a lecture by Kern on the world situation;
A31 1400 a review of the philosophy of Communist leaders by Ted Slack,
A31 1410 another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy
A31 1420 major at the University of Miami; and talks on how their Christian
A31 1430 faith can guide them in learning about and fighting Communism during
A31 1440 high school and college days, by Ted Place, director of Greater Miami
A31 1450 Youth for Christ, and Jon Braun, director of Campus Crusade
A31 1460 for Christ.   {The second half of the film "Communism on
A31 1470 the Map" and the movie "Operation Abolition" also will be
A31 1475 shown}.
A31 1480    Response to the program has been so encouraging, Kern
A31 1490 said, that a city-wide youth school at Dade County Auditorium may be
A31 1500 set up soon.   And to encourage other churches to try their own
A31 1510 programs, Kern said this Sunday's sessions- including the free
A31 1520 dinner- will be open to anyone who makes reservations.
A31 1530    The need for and the way to achieve a Christian home will be
A31 1540 stressed in special services marking National Christian Family Week
A31 1550 in Miami area churches next week.   Of particular meaning to
A31 1560 the Charles MacWhorter family, 3181 ~SW 24th Ter&, will be the
A31 1570 Family Dedication Service planned for 10:50 a&m& Sunday {at
A31 1580 First Christian Church}.   It will be the second time
A31 1590 the assistant manager of a Coral Gables restaurant and his wife have
A31 1600 taken part in the twice-a-year ceremonies for families with new babies.
A31 1610    The first one, two years ago, changed the routine of their
A31 1620 home life.   {"When you stand up in public and take vows to
A31 1630 strive to set an example before your children and to teach them the
A31 1640 fundamentals of the Christian faith, you strive a little harder to uphold
A31 1650 those vows", explains the slender vice president of the young couples
A31 1670 Sunday school class}.   Until that first dedication service,
A31 1680 he and Lois felt their children were too young to take part in
A31 1690 any religious life at home. They have five daughters- Coral Lee,
A31 1700 5, Glenda Rae, 4, Pamela, 3, Karen, 2, and Shari, five months.
A31 1710    But after that service, they decided to try to let the girls say
A31 1720 grace at the table, have bedtime prayers, and Bible stories. To their
A31 1730 surprise, the children all were eager and quite able to take part.
A31 1740 Even the two-year-old feels miffed if the family has a prayer-time without
A31 1750 her. #@# {DADE'S CHIEF} probation officer, Jack

A32 0250 to demonstrate at an ytime that it represents the spirit of Imperial
A32 0260 Russia in its most vulgar, infantile, and reactionary aspect; that
A32 0270 its persistent use by ballet companies of the Soviet regime indicates
A32 0280 that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was;
A32 0290 that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot
A32 0300 to boobify the American people; that its choreography is undistinguished
A32 0310 and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms. All
A32 0320 of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of
A32 0330 the Kirov's utterly captivating presentation. #PRECISE# The reasons
A32 0340 for this enchantment are numerous, but most of them end in "ova",
A32 0350 "eva", or "aya". In other words, no merely male creature
A32 0360 can resist that corps de ballet. It seems to have been chosen exclusively
A32 0370 from the winners of beauty contests- Miss Omsk, Miss Pinsk,
A32 0380 Miss Stalingr **h oops, skip it.   These qualities alone,
A32 0390 however, would not account for their success, and it took me a while to
A32 0400 discover the crowning virtue that completes this company's collective
A32 0410 personality. It is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address
A32 0420 toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to
A32 0430 the American ballet. Oh-the-pain-of-it, that convention of Russian
A32 0440 ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters
A32 0450 of impoverished Grand Dukes driven to thestage out of filial piety,
A32 0460 is totally absent from the Kirov. This is all the more remarkable
A32 0470 because the Kirov is to ballet what Senator Goldwater is to American
A32 0480 politics. But, obviously, at least some things have changed for
A32 0490 the better in Russia so far as the ballet is concerned.   Irina
A32 0500 Kolpakova, the Princess Aurora of Friday's performance, would
A32 0510 be a change for the better anywhere, at any time, no matter who had had
A32 0520 the role before. She is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes
A32 0530 on, and her dancing has a feminine suavity, lightness, sparkle, and refinement
A32 0540 which are simply incomparable. #HIT# Alla Sizova, who
A32 0550 seems to have made a special hit in the East, was delightful as the lady
A32 0560 Bluebird and her partner, Yuri Soloviev, was wonderfully
A32 0565 virile,
A32 0570 acrobatic, and poetic all at the same time, in a tradition not unlike
A32 0580 that of Nijinsky. Vladilen Semenov, a fine "danseur noble";
A32 0590 Konstantin Shatilov, a great character dancer; and Inna Zubkovskaya,
A32 0600 an excellent Lilac Fairy, were other outstanding members of the
A32 0610 cast, but every member of the cast was magnificent.   The production,
A32 0620 designed by Simon Virsaladze, was completely traditional but
A32 0630 traditional in the right way. It was done with great taste, was big and
A32 0640 spacious, sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes,
A32 0650 but sumptuous in a muted, pastel-like style, with rich, quiet harmonies
A32 0660 of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes
A32 0670 and the scenery.   Evegeni Dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally
A32 0680 large orchestra, one containing excellent soloists- the violin
A32 0690 solos by the concertmaster, Guy Lumia, were especially fine- but one
A32 0700 in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally
A32 0710 had not had time to achieve much unity.
A32 0720    Mail orders are now being received for the series of concerts
A32 0730 to be given this season under the auspices of the San Francisco Chamber

A32 0840    San Francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their
A32 0850 annual voluntary task of fixing up toys for distribution to needy children.
A32 0860    Fire Fighters Local 798, which is sponsoring the toy program
A32 0870 for the 12th straight year, issued a call for San Franciscans
A32 0880 to turn in discarded toys, which will be repaired by off-duty firemen.
A32 0890    Toys will not be collected at firehouses this year. They will
A32 0900 be accepted at all branches of the Bay View Federal Savings and
A32 0910 Loan Association, at a collection center in the center of the Stonestown
A32 0920 mall, and at the Junior Museum, 16th street and Roosevelt way.
A32 0930    From the collection centers, toys will be taken to a warehouse
A32 0940 at 198 Second street, where they will be repaired and made ready
A32 0950 for distribution.   Any needy family living in San Francisco can
A32 0960 obtain toys by writing to Christmas Toys, 676 Howard street, San
A32 0970 Francisco 5, and listing the parent's name and address and the age
A32 0980 and sex of each child in the family between the ages of 1 and 12. Requests
A32 0990 must be mailed in by December 5.
A32 1000 Famed cellist Pablo Casals took his instrument to the East Room of
A32 1010 the White House yesterday and charmed the staff with a two-hour rehearsal.
A32 1020 He was getting the feel of the room for a concert tomorrow night
A32 1030 for Puerto Rico Governor Luis Munoz Marin. President Kennedy's
A32 1040 invitation to the Spanish-born master said, "We feel your
A32 1050 performance as one of the world's greatest artists would lend distinction
A32 1060 to the entertainment of our guests".
A32 1070    FOR A GOOD MANY SEASONS I've been looking at the naughty
A32 1080 stuff on television, so the other night I thought I ought to see
A32 1090 how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies. After
A32 1100 all, this year's movies are next year's television shows.
A32 1110    So I went to see "La Dolce Vita".   <It has been billed
A32 1120 as a towering monument to immorality. All the sins of ancient Rome
A32 1130 are said to be collected into this three-hour film. If that's
A32 1140 all the Romans did, it's a surprise to me that Rome fell>.
A32 1150 After television, "La Dolce Vita" seems as harmless as a Gray
A32 1160 Line tour of North Beach at night. I cannot imagine a single scene
A32 1170 that isn't done in a far naughtier manner on ~TV every week.
A32 1180    I believe ~TV watchers will be bored.   <"La Dolce
A32 1190 Vita" has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average
A32 1200 ~TV Western. Week in, week out, there is more sex to be seen
A32 1210 in "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet". There is more decadence
A32 1220 on "77 Sunset Strip". There are more obvious nymphomaniacs
A32 1230 on any private-eye series>. #@# {IN ANOTHER RESPECT},
A32 1240 television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors
A32 1250 are unknowns. With the exception of Lex Barker and Anita Ekberg,
A32 1260 the credits are as unfamiliar as you'll find on the Robert Herridge
A32 1270 Theater.   Most of the emphasis has been placed on a "wild
A32 1280 party" at a seaside villa. Producer Fellini should have looked at
A32 1290 some of the old silent films where they really had {PARTIES}!
A32 1300 The Dolce Vita get-together boasted a strip tease (carried as
A32 1310 far as a black slip); a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries
A32 1320 the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her
A32 1330 face; a frigid beauty, and three silly fairies.   Put them all
A32 1340 together and they spell out the only four-letter word I can think of:
A32 1350 dull.   <Apparently Fellini caught the crowd when its parties
A32 1360 had begun to pall. What a swinging group they must have been when
A32 1370 they first started entertaining!> #@# {AS A MORAL SHOCKER}
A32 1380 it is a dud. But this doesn't detract from its merit as an
A32 1390 interesting, if not great, film. The Chronicle's Paine Knickerbocker
A32 1400 summed it up neatly:   "This is a long picture and a controversial
A32 1410 one, but basically it is a moral, enthralling and heartbreaking
A32 1420 description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps
A32 1430 Rome has from her traditional political, cultural and religious
A32 1440 glories".   <And when they sell it to television in a couple
A32 1450 of years, it can be shown without editing>. #@# TONIGHT

A32 1585 think>
A32 1590 YOU <have language problems>.
A32 1610    THE WEEK WENT along briskly enough. I bought a new little
A32 1620 foreign bomb. It is a British bomb. Very austere yet racy.
A32 1630    It is very chic to drive foreign cars. With a foreign car you must
A32 1640 wear a cap- it has a leather band in the back. You must also wear
A32 1650 a car coat.   The wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive.
A32 1660 But we couldn't really get along without it. #@# "WHERE
A32 1670 DO YOU put the lighter fluid, ha, ha"? asked the gas station
A32 1680 man. The present crop of small cars is enriching American humor.
A32 1690    Gas station people are very debonair about small cars.
A32 1700 When I drove a car with tail fins, I had plenty status at the wind-and-water
A32 1710 oases. My car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth.
A32 1720    This excellent foreign bomb takes only six.   When
A32 1730 I had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome, the
A32 1740 gas people were happy to see me.   "<Tires> OK? <Check
A32 1750 the oil and water, sir?>"   They polished the windshield.
A32 1760 They had a loving touch. #@# THE MAN STUCK the nozzle
A32 1770 in the gas tank. "What kind of car is it"? he asked gloomily.
A32 1780    "It is a British Austin, the smallest they make".
A32 1790 "Get much mileage"?   "About 35".   The gas station
A32 1800 man sighed unhappily.   "What I always say is what if
A32 1810 somebody clobbers you in a little car like that? Crunch, that's all
A32 1820 she wrote".   "I will die rich".   "That will be
A32 1830 $1.80", said the gas station man. "The windshield looks pretty
A32 1840 clean". #@# AH, THE FAIR-WEATHER friends of yesteryear!
A32 1850 When I wheeled about, finned fore and aft, I was the darling of the
A32 1860 doormen. Dollar bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps
A32 1870 politely.   With a small bomb, I tuck it between Cadillacs.
A32 1880 (The last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself. High
A32 1890 blood pressure can get the best of any of us.)
A33 0010    AT LAST the White House is going to get some much-copied
A33 0020 furniture by that master American craftsman, Duncan Phyfe, whose
A33 0030 designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the U& S& Presidents
A33 0040 of the 19th Century sent abroad for their furnishings.   The American
A33 0050 Institute of Decorators has acquired a rare complete set of
A33 0055 sofas
A33 0060 and chairs which are to be placed in the Executive Mansion's library.
A33 0070 The suite has been in the same family since the early 1800's.
A33 0080 The gift is being presented by "heirs and descendants of the Rutherford
A33 0090 family of New Jersey, whose famous estate,
A33 0095 "Tranquility",
A33 0100 was located near the Duncan Phyfe workshop at Andover, N& J&.
A33 0110    Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon,
A33 0120 although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned
A33 0130 after the style trends he set 150 years ago. This acquisition is
A33 0135 a
A33 0140 matched, perfect set- consisting of two sofas six feet long, plus six
A33 0150 sidechairs and two armchairs.   THE ~AID HAS undertaken
A33 0160 the redecoration of the White House library as a project in
A33 0170 connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's
A33 0180 Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential
A33 0190 home. It is the ~AID's intention to create in the
A33 0200 library "a miniature museum of Americana" before completed refurbishing
A33 0210 is unveiled early this fall.   The room will also feature
A33 0220 another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the
A33 0230 Duncan Phyfe furniture. The ~AID has found a mantlepiece attributed
A33 0240 to Samuel McIntyre of Salem, Mass&, an architect and woodcarver
A33 0250 who competed for the designing of the Capitol here in 1792.
A33 0260    The mantel was found in a recently demolished Salem house and
A33 0270 is being fitted over the White House library fireplace. It will be
A33 0280 painted to match the paneling in the room.   The ~AID committee's
A33 0290 chairman in charge of the redecoration, Mrs& Henry Francis
A33 0300 Lenygon, was in town yesterday to consult with White House staff
A33 0310 members on the project. Mrs& Lenygon's committee associates,
A33 0320 announced formally yesterday by the ~AID in New York, include Mrs&
A33 0330 Allen Lehman McCluskey and Stephen J& Jussel, both wellknown
A33 0340 Manhattan decorators. Regional representatives appointed to serve
A33 0350 from each section of the country include Frank E& Barnes of
A33 0360 Boston.
A33 0370    PRESIDENT KENNEDY couldn't stay away from his desk for
A33 0380 the 75-minute young people's concert played on the White House lawn
A33 0390 yesterday by the 85-piece Transylvania Symphony Orchestra from Brevard,
A33 0400 N& C&. But he left the doors to his office open so he
A33 0410 could hear the music.   At 4 p& m& the President left the White
A33 0420 House to welcome the young musicians, students from the ages of
A33 0430 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the Brevard Music Center summer camp,
A33 0440 and to greet the 325 crippled, cardiac and blind children from the
A33 0450 District area who were special guests at the concert.   It was
A33 0460 the first in the series of "Concerts for Young People by Young
A33 0470 People" to be sponsored by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy at the
A33 0480 White House. She was not present yesterday, however, to enjoy the
A33 0490 music or watch the faces of the delighted audience.   She is vacationing
A33 0510 at the Kennedy summer home in Hyannis Port, Mass&, and in
A33 0520 his welcoming remarks, the President said he was representing her.
A33 0530    As he approached the open bandstand, erected facing the South
A33 0540 entrance to the Executive Mansion, the band struck up the "Star Spangled
A33 0550 Banner" and followed it with "Hail to the Chief".
A33 0560    "I think they played Hail to the Chief better than the Marine
A33 0570 Corps Band, and we are grateful to them", President Kennedy remarked
A33 0580 after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor
A33 0590 James Christian Pfohl.   AFTER PAYING tribute to the conductor
A33 0600 and his white-clad youthful students, President Kennedy said,
A33 0610 "As an American I have the greatest possible pride in the work that
A33 0620 is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the United States-
A33 0630 schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested
A33 0640 young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music".
A33 0650    He added "**h I think that sometimes in this country
A33 0660 we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that
A33 0670 is being done in this field".   Displaying his knowledge of
A33 0680 music, the New England-born President remarked that "probably the
A33 0690 best chamber music in the world is played in Vermont, by young Americans-
A33 0700 and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary
A33 0710 musicians and teachers, and their work is being duplicated all across
A33 0720 the United States.   "This is a great national cultural asset,
A33 0730 and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me, representing
A33 0740 as I do today my wife, to welcome all of you here today at the
A33 0750 White House".   As he left the bandstand to return to his office,
A33 0760 the slender, sun-tanned Chief Executive paused along the way to
A33 0770 shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming
A33 0780 the first row under the field tent set up for the guests.   He
A33 0790 expressed surprise to learn that pretty, blonde Patricia Holbrook, 16,
A33 0795 of Mount Rainier,
A33 0800 had attended the Joseph P& Kennedy School
A33 0810 for the Handicapped in Boston. "The nuns there do a wonderful work",
A33 0820 the President commented. Patricia now attends the C& Melvin
A33 0830 Sharpe Health School in the District.   Each of the children
A33 0840 invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red, white and
A33 0850 blue ribbon. They enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during
A33 0860 the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the White
A33 0870 House staff.   MANY of the music-loving members of the President's
A33 0880 staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the
A33 0890 rapt attention given by the young seated audience. And it turned out
A33 0900 to be more of a family affair than expected. Henry Hall Wilson, a
A33 0910 student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the President's
A33 0920 staff as liaison representative with the House of Representatives, turned
A33 0930 guest conductor for a Sousa march, the "Stars and Stripes Forever".
A33 0950    Transylvania Symphony Conductor Pfohl said yesterday that Mrs&
A33 0960 Kennedy's Social Secretary, Letitia Baldrige, told about
A33 0970 plans for White House youth concerts before the National Symphony
A33 0980 Orchestra League in Philadelphia last spring.   He said he contacted
A33 0990 a friend, Henry Hall Wilson, on the President's staff and
A33 1000 asked whether his orchestra could play, in the series. A flow of correspondence
A33 1010 between Pfohl and Miss Baldrige resulted in an invitation
A33 1020 to the 85-student North Carolina group to play the first concert.
A33 1040    ONE OF THE MOST interested "students" on the tour which
A33 1050 the Brevard group took at the National Gallery yesterday following
A33 1060 their concert at the White House, was Letitia Baldrige, social
A33 1070 secretary to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy.   "I was an art
A33 1080 major in college", Miss Baldrige explained. "I've been here
A33 1090 so many times I couldn't count them". She turned out to be a fan,
A33 1100 too, of Margaret Bouton, the Gallery's associate curator of education.
A33 1110    Miss Bouton headed up one of the four groups that went
A33 1120 on simultaneous tours after the Gallery had closed at 5
A33 1130 p& m&.
A33 1140 The Brevard group of 85 arrived at the Gallery at 6 p& m&, remaining
A33 1150 for about 45 minutes.   The Brevard visitors had very little
A33 1160 to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later. They decided
A33 1170 that they thought Rembrandt's self-portrait made him look "sad"**h
A33 1180 they noticed Roman buildings in the background of Raphael's
A33 1190 "Alba Madonna" and "texture" in a Monet painting of Rheims
A33 1200 Cathedral. Everybody had heard of Van Gogh, the French impressionist.
A33 1210    Gallery Director John Walker greeted the group, standing
A33 1220 on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them.
A33 1230 He pointed out to the young musicians that the National Gallery "is
A33 1240 the only museum in the country to have a full-time music director
A33 1250 **h Richard Bales **h I'm sure you've heard af him **h and his
A33 1260 record, 'The Confederacy'".   Along with the gallery aide
A33 1270 who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group, went
A33 1280 one of the Gallery's blue-uniformed guards.   In 45 minutes,
A33 1290 the Gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art
A33 1300 from the Renaissance to the late 19th Century.   A few of them
A33 1310 said they "preferred contemporary art".   Among the other
A33 1320 artists, whose paintings were discussed were Boucher, Courbet, Fra
A33 1330 Angelico.   The thing that impressed one of the visitors the most
A33 1340 was the Gallery's rotunda fountain **h "because it's on the
A33 1350 second floor".
A33 1360    That imposing, somewhat austere, and seemingly remote collonaded
A33 1370 building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th st&
A33 1380 nw& took on bustling life yesterday.   More than 250 Scottish
A33 1390 Rite Masons and guests gathered in their House of the Temple
A33 1400 to pay tribute to their most prominent leader, Albert Pike, who headed
A33 1410 the Scottish Rite from 1859 to 1891.   They came together in
A33 1420 the huge, high-ceilinged Council Chamber to hear the late leader eulogized.
A33 1430 C& Wheeler Barnes of Denver, head of the Scottish Rite
A33 1440 in Colorado, praised Pike as a historian, author, poet, journalist,
A33 1450 lawyer, jurist, soldier and musician, who devoted most of his mature
A33 1460 years to the strengthening of the Masonic Order.   The ceremony
A33 1470 ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of Pike in the House
A33 1480 of the Temple. A reception and tea followed.   About 1500
A33 1490 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the
A33 1500 Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite for the Southern Jurisdiction
A33 1510 of the United States.   The opening session of the 5-day session
A33 1520 will begin at 10 a& m& today. There will be a pilgrimage to
A33 1530 Mount Vernon at 2:30 p& m&. A wreath will be placed at the
A33 1540 tomb of George Washington, one of this Nation's first Masons-
A33 1550 a past master of Washington-Alexandria Lodge 22 in Alexandria.
A33 1560    THE MARRIAGE of John and Mary Black had clearly reached
A33 1570 the breaking point after eight years.   John had a job in a small
A33 1580 firm where the work was dull and monotonous. He would come home in
A33 1590 the evening tired and discouraged- in no frame of mind to play with
A33 1600 their three children, or spend much time chatting with his wife.
A33 1610    Hurt by his lack of interest and attention, Mary complained often
A33 1620 that he didn't help around the house, and that he didn't really
A33 1630 care about the family. She accused him of ignoring her. He in turn told
A33 1640 her she demanded too much. They were both discouraged, disgusted
A33 1650 and miserable.   Mary decided she had had enough. Without any definite
A33 1660 plan in mind, she went to a judge to see what could be done. The
A33 1670 judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations-
A33 1680 then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from
A33 1685 Family
A33 1690 Service before going to a lawyer.   Family Service, sharing
A33 1700 in ~UGF, has five agencies in the Washington area. They offer
A33 1710 to the people of this community case work service and counseling on
A33 1720 a wide variety of family problems.   Because neither of them really
A33 1730 wanted their marriage to break up, Mr& and Mrs& Black agreed
A33 1740 to a series of interviews at Family Service of Northern Virginia,
A33 1750 the agency nearest them. For nearly a year, they have been receiving
A33 1760 counseling, separately and together, in an effort to understand and
A33 1770 overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce.
A33 1780 The interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of
A33 1790 the problems confronting the other. They are now working together toward
A33 1800 solving their difficulties.   JOHN received a promotion
A33 1810 in his firm. He gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on
A33 1820 life. Mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings,
A33 1830 and the children's bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session
A33 1840 of happy, family rough-housing.   To outsiders, the Blacks seem
A33 1850 to be an ordinary, happy family, and they are- but with a difference.
A33 1860 They know the value of being just that- an ordinary, happy family.
A33 1870    Family Service has helped hundreds of families in this
A33 1880 area. Perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital. But
A33 1890 to the families it serves, their help cannot be measured. Family Service
A33 1900 could not open its doors to a single family without the financial
A33 1910 support of the United Givers Fund.

A34 0010 #FOR CRUCIAL ENCOUNTER# One of the initial questions put to President
A34 0020 Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his
A34 0030 attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev. Mr& Kennedy
A34 0040 replied:   @ "I'm hopeful that from @ more traditional
A34 0050 exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground".   The
A34 0060 President knew that a confrontation with Mr& Khrushchev sooner or
A34 0070 later probably was inevitable and even desirable. But he was convinced
A34 0080 that the realities of power- military, economic and ideological-
A34 0090 were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that
A34 0100 these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting. He
A34 0110 wanted to buy time to strengthen the U& S& and its allies and
A34 0120 to define and begin to implement his foreign policy.   Last Friday
A34 0130 the White House announced:   President Kennedy will
A34 0140 meet
A34 0150 with Soviet Premier Nikita S& Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and
A34 0160 4.   The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration
A34 0170 in East-West relations. The heightened tension, in fact, had been
A34 0180 a major factor in the President's change of view about the urgency
A34 0190 of a meeting with the Soviet leader. He was not going to Vienna
A34 0200 to negotiate- the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow
A34 0210 last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned. But
A34 0220 Mr& Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with
A34 0230 Mr& Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe.
A34 0240    That objective set the high stakes and drama of the Vienna meeting.
A34 0250 Despite efforts by Washington last week to play down the significance
A34 0260 of the meeting, it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters
A34 0270 of the cold war. @ #ROAD TO VIENNA# The U& S& and
A34 0280 Soviet heads of Government have met three times since Sir Winston
A34 0290 Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy
A34 0300 with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace "at the
A34 0310 summit of the nations".   The first time was in 1955 when a
A34 0320 full-dress Big Four summit meeting produced the "spirit of Geneva".
A34 0330 The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads
A34 0340 into the Middle East.   In 1959 President Eisenhower
A34 0350 and Premier Khrushchev held an informal session in the U& S&.
A34 0360 That meeting produced the "spirit of Camp David"- a spirit, it
A34 0370 later turned out, that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress
A34 0380 toward a Berlin settlement.   On the third occasion- another
A34 0390 Big Four summit session at Paris a year ago- there was no problem
A34 0400 of an illusory "spirit". Premier Khrushchev wrecked the conference
A34 0410 at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the U& S&
A34 0420 for the ~U-2 incident. The episode tended to confirm the U&
A34 0430 S& belief that propaganda, the hope of one-sided concessions, and
A34 0440 the chance to split the Allies, rather than genuine negotiation, were
A34 0450 the Soviet leader's real aims in summitry. #PRE-INAUGURAL POSITION#
A34 0460 Thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration
A34 0470 that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President, Mr&
A34 0480 Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem. Shortly before his
A34 0490 nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations
A34 0500 with the Soviet leader in these words:   "As long
A34 0510 as Mr& Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is
A34 0520 shifting his way, no amount of either smiles or toughness, neither Camp
A34 0530 David talks nor kitchen debates, can compel him to enter fruitful
A34 0535 negotiations".
A34 0540    The President had set for himself the task, which
A34 0550 he believed vital, of awakening the U& S& and its allies to
A34 0560 the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance. He did
A34 0570 not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make
A34 0580 it unnecessary. He wanted time, too, to review the United States'
A34 0590 global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited
A34 0600 and new ones he was formulating. Above all, he did not want to appear
A34 0610 to be running hat in hand to Premier Khrushchev's doorstep. #ATTITUDE
A34 0620 FLEXIBLE# At the same time the President took pains not to
A34 0630 rule out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader. Ideally, he knew,
A34 0640 it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels. But Mr&
A34 0650 Kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting, provided that undue
A34 0660 hopes were not raised in connection with it. It would give him an
A34 0670 opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war,
A34 0680 to try to probe Mr& Khrushchev's intentions and to make clear
A34 0690 his own views. Moreover, an eventual meeting was desirable if for no
A34 0700 other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the U& S& was not
A34 0710 inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions.
A34 0720    Both elements- the caution about a meeting, the willingness
A34 0730 eventually to hold one- were reflected in a letter from the President
A34 0740 which Ambassador Llewellyn E& Thompson brought back to Russia
A34 0750 late in February. The letter, dated Feb& 22, was delivered to
A34 0760 Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk, Siberia, on March 9. It dealt
A34 0770 mainly with a broad range of East-West issues. But it also briefly
A34 0780 suggested the possibility of a meeting with Mr& Khrushchev before
A34 0790 the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and
A34 0800 schedules permitted.   Developments over the next two months, however,
A34 0810 caused the President to reconsider the question of the timing.
A34 0820 There were intense discussions in the inner councils of the White House
A34 0830 about the advisability of an early meeting, not because the international
A34 0840 climate was improving, but precisely because it was deteriorating
A34 0850 alarmingly. #DEADLOCK ON TESTS# The President was especially
A34 0860 concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at
A34 0870 Geneva. The deadlock has been caused by the Russians' new demand
A34 0880 for a three-man (East, West and neutral) directorate, and thus a veto,
A34 0890 over the control machinery. In the U& S&, strong pressures
A34 0900 have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians
A34 0910 may be secretly testing.   Mr& Kennedy was less troubled
A34 0920 by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown,
A34 0930 or even continued stalemate, would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear
A34 0940 weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament.
A34 0950 There was reason to believe that Premier Khrushchev was
A34 0960 also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons, particularly
A34 0970 to Communist China. The question arose as to whether a frank discussion
A34 0980 of that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgent. Moreover,
A34 0990 Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle
A34 1000 to the executive organs of all international bodies, including
A34 1010 the U& N& Secretariat and the International Control Commission
A34 1020 for Laos. Mr& Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand
A34 1030 would make international agreements, or even negotiations, impossible.
A34 1040    Developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the advisability
A34 1050 of an early summit meeting. Initially the White House reaction
A34 1060 was that the bitter exchanges with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict
A34 1070 in Laos had dampened prospects for a meeting. At the same time,
A34 1080 there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader,
A34 1090 as a result of those episodes, come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion
A34 1100 about the West's ability and determination to resist Communist
A34 1110 pressure.   In Cuba, the U& S& had blundered badly and
A34 1120 created the impression of impotency against Communist penetration even
A34 1130 on its own doorstep. In Laos, the picture was almost equally bad.
A34 1140 U& S& willingness to accept a neutral Laos may have led Premier
A34 1150 Khrushchev to believe that other areas could be "neutralized"
A34 1160 on Soviet terms. Beyond that, Allied disagreement about military intervention
A34 1170 in Laos- despite warnings that they might do so- allowed
A34 1180 Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic
A34 1190 moves that greatly strengthened the pro-Communist forces. As a result,
A34 1200 the West is in a poor bargaining position at the current Geneva
A34 1210 negotiations on Laos, and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast
A34 1220 Asia are under increased pressure.   In the light of those
A34 1230 events, there appeared to be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev
A34 1240 might overreach himself. Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow
A34 1250 that the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive. He has indicated
A34 1260 that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is out. The
A34 1270 President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn
A34 1280 Premier Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such
A34 1290 as Berlin, Iran or Latin America from which there would be no turning
A34 1300 back.   It was in the midst of such White House deliberations
A34 1310 that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries through the
A34 1320 U& S& Embassy in Moscow about a meeting with the President in
A34 1330 the near future. Mr& Kennedy told Moscow he would give his answer
A34 1340 by May 20 after consultation with the Allies. The response from
A34 1350 London, Paris and Bonn was favorable. Firm arrangements for the meeting
A34 1360 in Vienna were worked out in a final exchange between Moscow and
A34 1370 Washington last week. Apparently at the insistence of the U& S&,
A34 1380 the simultaneous announcements issued in Washington and Moscow
A34 1390 last Friday emphasized the "informal" nature of the meeting. The
A34 1400 Washington announcement said:   @ "The President and Chairman
A34 1410 Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose
A34 1420 of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems
A34 1430 that involve the interest of many other countries. The meeting
A34 1440 will, however, afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first
A34 1450 personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the
A34 1460 major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries".
A34 1470 @ #THE OUTLOOK# The Vienna meeting will bring together a
A34 1475 seasoned,
A34 1480 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who, in Mr& Kennedy's
A34 1490 own words, is "shrewd, tough, vigorous, well-informed and confident",
A34 1500 and a 44-year-old President (his birthday is May 29) with a
A34 1510 demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international
A34 1520 diplomacy. The announcement last week of the forthcoming
A34 1530 encounter produced strong reactions in the U& S& of both approval
A34 1540 and disapproval.   The approval did not arise from an expectation
A34 1550 of far-reaching agreements at Vienna. The inclination was to accept
A34 1560 the statement that there would be no formal negotiations. But those
A34 1570 who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between
A34 1580 the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary.
A34 1590 Mr& Khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about
A34 1600 his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men. The feeling was
A34 1610 that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the
A34 1620 President and that plain talk by Mr& Kennedy would give him pause.
A34 1630    Apart from the personal equation, another reason advanced
A34 1640 in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the U&S&
A34 1650 appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit. Premier Khrushchev
A34 1660 has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got
A34 1670 his summit meeting anyway. This time the initiative came, in part
A34 1680 at least, from Washington. #OTHER ALLIES CONSULTED# There was also
A34 1690 the fact that by the time he meets Mr& Khrushchev, the President
A34 1700 will have completed conversations with all the other principal Allied
A34 1710 leaders. Thus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader
A34 1720 of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity.   Finally,
A34 1730 there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the President's
A34 1740 making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test
A34 1750 accord. There is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings
A34 1760 throughout the world. If tests are to be resumed, the argument went,
A34 1770 it is vital that the U& S& make plain that the onus belongs to
A34 1780 the Soviet Union.   Disapproval of the meeting was based largely
A34 1790 on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse. After Cuba
A34 1800 and Laos, it was argued, Mr& Khrushchev will interpret the President's
A34 1810 consent to the meeting as further evidence of Western weakness-
A34 1820 perhaps even panic- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage
A34 1830 he now believes he holds. Moreover, the President is meeting the
A34 1840 Soviet leader at a time when the Administration has still not decided
A34 1850 on the scope of America's firm foreign policy commitments. The
A34 1860 question was raised, for example, as to what attitude the President
A34 1870 would take if Mr& Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending
A34 1880 from Southeast Asia to the Middle East.
A35 0010    THERE ARE, so my biologist friends tell me, mechanisms of
A35 0020 adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory.
A35 0030 Mollusks are a case in point. The shell, which served the strain
A35 0040 so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme, tended
A35 0050 to cancel out the possibility of future development. Though this may
A35 0060 or may not be good biology, it does aptly illustrate the strength and
A35 0070 the weakness of American Catholic higher education.   There can
A35 0080 be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field
A35 0090 of higher education is most impressive: our European brethren never
A35 0100 cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities.
A35 0110 The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades,
A35 0120 rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that.
A35 0130 By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement
A35 0140 stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which
A35 0150 brought the parochial school system into existence.   There
A35 0160 is, however, one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture.
A35 0170 Viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect,
A35 0180 we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school
A35 0190 to university. But the simple truth is that higher education has
A35 0200 never really been an official American Catholic project; certainly
A35 0210 not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school
A35 0220 system has been a matter of official policy.   Official encouragement
A35 0230 is one thing, but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan
A35 0240 and parochial funds. American Catholics have responded generously
A35 0250 to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to
A35 0260 create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar
A35 0270 fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning. They
A35 0280 have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly
A35 0290 ever been made. Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this
A35 0300 as their direct responsibility.   All of this may be understandable
A35 0310 enough: it is, however, in fact difficult to see how diocesan
A35 0320 authorities could have acted otherwise. Yet for better or for worse,
A35 0330 the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic colleges do
A35 0340 <not> owe their existence to general Catholic support but rather to
A35 0350 the initiative, resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious
A35 0360 communities. Community <esprit de corps> has been the protective
A35 0370 shell which has made the achievement possible.   To understand
A35 0380 the past history- and the future potential- of American Catholic
A35 0390 higher education, it is necessary to appreciate the special character
A35 0400 of the <esprit d' corps> of the religious community. It is something
A35 0410 more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and
A35 0420 detachment. A religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves
A35 0430 a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found
A35 0440 elsewhere. The fact that the group orientation and group identification
A35 0450 are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs
A35 0460 of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension.
A35 0470 The net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship,
A35 0480 the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting
A35 0490 edge of sacrifice and hardship.   American Catholic colleges
A35 0500 and universities are, in a very real sense, the product of "private
A35 0510 enterprise"- the "private enterprise" of religious communities.
A35 0520 Had it not been for such private enterprise, diocesan authorities
A35 0530 might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized
A35 0540 by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious
A35 0550 as paid employees. There is however no point in speculating about such
A35 0560 a possibility: the fact of the matter is that our institutions of
A35 0570 higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which
A35 0580 produces the "family business". This "family-community" spirit
A35 0590 is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement. ##
A35 0600 IT IS this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of American
A35 0610 Catholic higher education, in particular the wasteful duplication
A35 0620 apparent in some areas. I think for example of three women's colleges
A35 0630 with pitifully small enrollments, clustered within a few miles of
A35 0640 a major Catholic university, which is also co-educational. This is not
A35 0650 an isolated example; this aspect of the total picture has been commented
A35 0660 upon often enough. It would seem to represent <esprit de corps>
A35 0670 run riot.   Apart, however, from the question of wasteful duplication,
A35 0680 there is another aspect of the "family business" spirit
A35 0690 in American Catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny.
A35 0700 For while the past needs of the Church in this country may have
A35 0710 been adequately met by collegiate institutions, which in temper and tone
A35 0720 closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools, it would
A35 0730 seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles
A35 0740 the university in its "pursuit of excellence". At the earlier
A35 0750 "pre-academic excellence" stage of Catholic education, the operation
A35 0760 could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis. But with today's
A35 0770 demand for professional qualifications and specialized training,
A35 0780 the need for "outsiders" become more pressing. ## THE PROBLEM
A35 0790 is not merely that more "outside teachers" are needed but
A35 0800 that a different brand is called for. Commenting on the earlier stage,
A35 0810 the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University
A35 0820 Professors
A35 0830 (in a recent report on the question of faculty participation
A35 0840 in administrative decision-making) noted that the term "teacher-employee"
A35 0850 (as opposed to, e&g&, "maintenance employee") was
A35 0860 a not inapt description. Today however, the "outsider" is likely
A35 0870 to have professional qualifications of the highest order (otherwise
A35 0880 the college would not be interested in hiring him) and to be acclimatized
A35 0890 to the democratic processes of the secular or state university. And
A35 0900 while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene, the scholar
A35 0910 will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second
A35 0920 class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank
A35 0930 or professional achievement.   In the above mentioned report of
A35 0940 the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University
A35 0950 Professors, the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges
A35 0960 very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see
A35 0970 it: "Even with the best of intentions he (the President of the
A35 0980 university) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to
A35 0990 a group the membership of which, considered (as it must be by him) in
A35 1000 individual terms, is inhomogeneous, mortal and of extremely varying
A35 1010 temperament, interests and capabilities. It is natural that he should
A35 1020 turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization
A35 1030 which actually owns the university and whose goals are, in
A35 1040 their opinion, identified with its highest good and (to use that oft-repeated
A35 1050 phrase) 'the attainment of excellence'".   The pattern
A35 1060 here pictured is clearly not peculiar to Notre Dame: it is simply
A35 1070 that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution
A35 1080 by "the organization which actually owns" it, becomes more obvious
A35 1090 where there is a larger and more distinguished "outside" faculty.
A35 1100 It is particularly interesting that those who framed the report
A35 1110 should refer to "the organization which actually owns the university":
A35 1130 this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more
A35 1140 to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension. But
A35 1150 in any case, one does not have to read very closely between the lines
A35 1160 to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy
A35 1170 one. "Outside" faculty members want to be considered partners in
A35 1180 the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business.
A35 1190    There are two reasons why failure to come to grips with
A35 1200 this demand could be fatal to the future of the Catholic university.
A35 1210 In the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber
A35 1220 personnel. Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession,
A35 1230 much given to attending meetings and conferences. Expressions
A35 1240 of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college faculty member
A35 1250 has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype. In
A35 1260 the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or
A35 1270 a boycott: all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines
A35 1280 to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions
A35 1290 at the Catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere.
A35 1300    To appreciate the nature of the gamble, it should be realized
A35 1310 that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security,
A35 1320 that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does
A35 1330 in an elementary school system or in the Civil Service. Much has
A35 1340 been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee
A35 1350 firm tenure. This is a significant advance but its import should not
A35 1360 be exaggerated. When a man invests a block of his years at a university
A35 1370 without gaining the coveted promotion, not only is he faced with the
A35 1380 problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in
A35 1390 the market value of his services. A man does not make that kind of
A35 1400 gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure
A35 1410 positions is being reserved for members of the "family". ## JUST
A35 1420 AS IT is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new
A35 1430 tenure practices, it is also possible to exaggerate the significance
A35 1440 of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutions.
A35 1450 Adequate compensation is indispensable. Yet adequate compensation-
A35 1460 and particularly <merely> adequate compensation is no substitute
A35 1470 for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his
A35 1480 earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place. Broadly
A35 1490 speaking the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible
A35 1500 but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature
A35 1510 responsibility in the total work of the university. Religious who
A35 1520 derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious
A35 1530 community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate
A35 1540 both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this
A35 1550 identification.   There is no need here to spell out the conditions
A35 1560 of creative teaching except to point out that, at the college
A35 1570 level, the sense of community and of community responsibility is even
A35 1580 more necessary than it is at other levels. The college teacher needs
A35 1590 the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also
A35 1600 needs to feel that such communication, even informal debates over the
A35 1610 luncheon table, are a contribution to the total good of the institution.
A35 1620 But this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from
A35 1630 the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation.
A35 1640    The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy
A35 1650 between faculty members who are part of the "in-group" that owns and
A35 1660 operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees, is,
A35 1670 therefore, the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself.
A35 1680 This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary
A35 1690 and tenure. Yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive
A35 1700 resolution of the problem of ownership and control, there are nevertheless
A35 1710 certain suggestions which seem to be in order.   The first
A35 1720 is a negative warning: there is no point in the creation of faculty
A35 1730 committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real
A35 1740 authority. In the case of academic personnel the "feeling" of
A35 1750 participation can hardly be "faked". Competent teachers are well
A35 1760 versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without
A35 1770 destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own
A35 1780 decisions. Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar
A35 1790 with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to
A35 1800 be taken in by "busy-work" and <ersatz> decision making.
A35 1810 In any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of
A35 1820 participation are what is called for at all. In the Notre Dame report,
A35 1830 reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced
A35 1840 to "luncheon-table communication". In itself there is nothing wrong
A35 1850 with this form of "participation": the only difficulty on the
A35 1860 Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position
A35 1870 to implement policy, i&e&, members of the religious community which
A35 1880 owns and administers the institution, have their own eating arrangements.
A36 0010 SEN& JOHN L& McCLELLAN of Arkansas and Rep& David
A36 0020 Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions
A36 0030 under the anti-monopoly laws. Once more the fallacious equation is advanced
A36 0040 to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly
A36 0050 laws, there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions:
A36 0060 the law must treat everybody equally. Or, in the words of Anatole
A36 0070 France, "The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich,
A36 0080 as well as the poor, from begging in the streets and sleeping under
A36 0090 bridges".   The public atmosphere that has been generated which
A36 0100 makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute
A36 0110 into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr& McClellan's
A36 0120 hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and, later,
A36 0130 into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations
A36 0140 at the missile sites. The Senator was shocked by stoppages over
A36 0150 allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program. In addition,
A36 0160 disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess
A36 0170 of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation
A36 0180 on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill.
A36 0190 It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages, but
A36 0200 he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes
A36 0210 to fight a strike. <Business Week> (Aug& 9, 1961) reports that
A36 0220 the United Aircraft Company, against which the International Association
A36 0230 of Machinists had undertaken a strike, decided to keep its plants
A36 0240 operating. The company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable
A36 0250 to four factors: advertising to attract new employees, hiring
A36 0260 and training them, extra overtime, and defective work performed by
A36 0270 the new workers. The company has billed the United States Government
A36 0280 for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation
A36 0290 allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and
A36 0300 necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business.   Rep&
A36 0310 Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the
A36 0320 attention of the Armed Services Committee. The committee remains unresponsive.
A36 0330 Neither has Congressman Martin nor Senator McClellan
A36 0340 been heard from on the matter; they are preoccupied with ending labor
A36 0350 abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions. ## THE
A36 0360 RECENT publicity attending the successful federal prosecution
A36 0370 of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers
A36 0380 has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified
A36 0390 neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained. The
A36 0400 anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete, but along completely
A36 0410 undefined lines; it must play a game in which there never is
A36 0420 a winner. The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully
A36 0430 cannot follow the law. Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a
A36 0440 foolish public policy.   Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods
A36 0450 industry in which General Electric, Westinghouse and a number of
A36 0460 other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy
A36 0470 to rig prices and allocate the market. The industry is so structured
A36 0480 that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way
A36 0490 overhead charges are allocated- whether marginal or average pricing
A36 0500 is applied.   The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise
A36 0510 is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods
A36 0520 in addition to the heavy electrical equipment. Accounting procedures
A36 0530 can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price. Naturally,
A36 0540 enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to
A36 0550 structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors
A36 0560 can be forced to the wall in a very short time. Should these giants
A36 0570 really flex their competitive muscles, they would become the only
A36 0580 survivors in the industry. Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating
A36 0590 a monopoly by "unfair competition". But if they show self-restraint,
A36 0600 they don't get the orders.   Under the circumstances,
A36 0610 the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage
A36 0620 in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter
A36 0630 were convicted. Engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy
A36 0640 by the giants. The paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by
A36 0650 the demand of the government, after the conviction, that General Electric
A36 0660 sign a wide-open consent decree that <it would not reduce prices
A36 0670 so low as to compete seriously with its fellows>. In other words,
A36 0680 the anti-trust laws, designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday,
A36 0690 Wednesday and Friday, become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer
A36 0700 on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. And which theory would
A36 0710 govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday? ## THE QUESTION
A36 0720 might be asked: "Don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods
A36 0730 manufacturers know these facts? Why did they engage in a
A36 0740 flood of <mea culpas>, throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise
A36 0750 to be good boys thereafter, expressing their complete confidence in
A36 0760 the laws"?   The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to
A36 0770 management was explained by Thurman Arnold, in <The Folklore of Capitalism>,
A36 0780 back in 1937. He wrote: "(P& 211) **h the anti-trust
A36 0790 laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need
A36 0800 of great organizations, and at the same time had to deny them a place
A36 0810 in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure. (P& 214)
A36 0820 **h anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled
A36 0830 business dictatorship. (P& 215) **h when corporate abuses were attacked,
A36 0840 it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked
A36 0850 rather than control. **h In this manner, every scheme for direct
A36 0860 control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust
A36 0870 laws. (Pp& 228-229) **h in any event, it is obvious that the anti-trust
A36 0880 laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial
A36 0890 empires the world has ever known, held together by some of the most
A36 0900 fantastic ideas, all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation
A36 0910 is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control
A36 0920 by the government".   This escape from control has led to management's
A36 0930 evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as
A36 0940 worth while. A plea of <nolo contendere>, followed by a nominal fine,
A36 0950 after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license. (The
A36 0960 penalties handed out in the electrical case, which included jail
A36 0970 sentences, were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions, perhaps because
A36 0980 the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing
A36 0990 activities.)   If a substitute mechanism is needed for the control
A36 1000 of a fictitious impersonal market, quite obviously some method must
A36 1010 be devised for representing the public interest. A secret conspiracy
A36 1020 of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle. However, one can argue that
A36 1030 no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust
A36 1040 laws are effective and rational. Quite clearly the anti-trust laws
A36 1050 are neither effective nor rational- and yet the argument goes that
A36 1060 they should be extended to the labor union.   THOSE WHO
A36 1070 favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating
A36 1080 a brand new reform.   Before 1933, individuals who opposed
A36 1090 trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain English.
A36 1100 The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934,
A36 1110 implicit in the writing of Section 7~A of the National Industrial
A36 1120 Recovery Act, has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining
A36 1130 in principle. The Wagner Act, the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin
A36 1140 Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining.
A36 1150    The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system
A36 1160 is the removal of wages from competition. If a union cannot perform
A36 1170 this function, then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers
A36 1180 as a gigantic fraud.   The tortured reasoning that unions
A36 1190 use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply
A36 1200 and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession.
A36 1210 The problem must be faced squarely. If laborers are merely commodities
A36 1220 competing against each other in a market place like so many bags
A36 1230 of wheat and corn (unsupported, by the way, by any agricultural subsidy),
A36 1240 then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism
A36 1250 to a system that imposes such status upon them.   Human labor
A36 1260 was exactly that- a commodity- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
A36 1270 America. As early as 1776, Adam Smith wrote in <The Wealth of
A36 1280 Nations>: "We have no acts of Parliament against combining
A36 1290 to lower the price of work; but many against combining to raise it".
A36 1300 Eighteenth-century England, upon whose customs our common law was
A36 1310 built, had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies. In 1825,
A36 1320 the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced
A36 1330 by the organized employers, who declared: "It is **h considered
A36 1340 that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to **h effect
A36 1350 the value of labor **h tend to convert all its branches into monopolies".
A36 1360    There were no pious hypocrisies then about being <for>
A36 1370 collective bargaining, but <against> labor monopoly. The courts
A36 1380 shared the opinion of the employers. In <People vs& Fisher>, Justice
A36 1390 Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared:   "Without
A36 1400 any officious and improper interference on the subject, the
A36 1410 price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand
A36 1420 for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid
A36 1430 for it; but the right does not exist to raise **h the wages of the mechanic
A36 1440 by any forced and artificial means".   Compare this statement
A36 1450 of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin, according
A36 1460 to the <Daily Labor Report> of Sept& 19, 1961, defends
A36 1470 the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor
A36 1480 "if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages, production or
A36 1490 prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his
A36 1500 employees to contract on wages, hours and conditions of employment".
A36 1510    Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust
A36 1520 measures to unions in transportation. His bill, allegedly aimed at
A36 1530 Hoffa, would amend the Sherman, Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts
A36 1540 to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation
A36 1550 strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert
A36 1560 with any other union- even a sister local in the same international.
A36 1570    Paradoxically, the same week in which Senator McClellan was
A36 1580 attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation,
A36 1590 the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they
A36 1600 met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel, the action
A36 1610 would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act. Indeed, it
A36 1620 is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently
A36 1630 granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws; for example,
A36 1640 the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the
A36 1650 encouragement of railroads to seek mergers. At the very moment that
A36 1660 every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality
A36 1670 of anti-trust legislation, a drive is on to abolish collective
A36 1680 bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions
A36 1690 who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that
A36 1700 ship operators set freight rates. ## THE passage of the
A36 1710 Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopolies. It was most effective against
A36 1720 trade unions. In the famous Danbury Hatters case, a suit was
A36 1730 brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices,
A36 1740 e&g&, trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product
A36 1750 of the struck manufacturer. The suit against the union was successful
A36 1760 and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment.
A36 1770    In 1914, the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under
A36 1780 the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be
A36 1790 considered a commodity. The law could not suspend economics. Labor remained
A36 1800 a commodity- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization
A36 1810 from the anti-trust laws.   The courts, by interpretation,
A36 1820 emasculated the act. In 1922, the United Mine Workers struck the
A36 1830 Coronado Coal Company. The company sued under the anti-trust laws,
A36 1840 alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of
A36 1850 interstate commerce. (What other purpose could a striking union have
A36 1860 but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise?) The
A36 1870 court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference
A36 1880 with commerce.
A37 0010 #THE NATION# _THE THREE-FRONT WAR_ At a closed-door session
A37 0020 on Capitol Hill last week, Secretary of State Christian Herter made
A37 0030 his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
A37 0040 U&S& affairs abroad. Afterward, Tennessee's Democratic Senator
A37 0050 Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen. What Herter presented,
A37 0060 said Gore, was "not a very encouraging review". That was something
A37 0070 of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between
A37 0080 the West and Communism erupted on three fronts. While Communists
A37 0090 were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos,
A37 0100 two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration
A37 0110 into emergency conferences and serious decisions. _1) CUBA._
A37 0120 Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery, Dictator
A37 0130 Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U&S& with a blunt and
A37 0140 drastic demand: within 48 hours, the U&S& had to reduce its
A37 0150 embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons (the
A37 0160 embassy staff alone totaled 87 U&S& citizens, plus 120 Cuban
A37 0170 employees). President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a&m& meeting with
A37 0180 top military and foreign-policy advisers, decided to break off diplomatic
A37 0190 relations immediately. "There is a limit to what the United
A37 0200 States in self-respect can endure", said the President. "That limit
A37 0210 has now been reached".   Through Secretary Herter, Ike
A37 0220 offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new
A37 0230 Administration with the breakoff decision. Kennedy, through Secretary-designate
A37 0240 of State Dean Rusk, declined. He thus kept his hands
A37 0250 free for any action after Jan& 20, although reaction to the break
A37 0260 was generally favorable in the U&S& and Latin America (<see>
A37 0270 THE HEMISPHERE). _2) LAOS._ After a White House huddle
A37 0280 between the President and top lieutenants, the Defense Department reacted
A37 0290 sharply to a cry from the pro-Western government of Laos that
A37 0300 several battalions of Communist troops had invaded Laos from North
A37 0310 Viet Nam. "In view of the present situation in Laos", said the
A37 0320 Pentagon's announcement, "we are taking normal precautionary actions
A37 0330 to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific". Cutting
A37 0340 short a holiday at Hong Kong, the aircraft carriers <Lexington>
A37 0350 and <Bennington> steamed off into the South China Sea, accompanied
A37 0360 by a swarm of destroyers, plus troopships loaded with marines.
A37 0370 On the U&S&'s island base of Okinawa, Task Force 116, made
A37 0380 up of Army, Navy, Marine and Air Force units, got braced to move
A37 0390 southward on signal.   But by week's end the Laotian cry of
A37 0400 invasion was read as an exaggeration (<see> FOREIGN NEWS), and
A37 0410 the U&S& was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies
A37 0420 that a neutralist- rather than a pro-Western- government might
A37 0430 be best for Laos. _FRENCH + INDIANS._ There was a moral of
A37 0440 sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war
A37 0450 fronts. Political, economic and military experts were all agreed that
A37 0460 chaotic, mountainous little Laos was the last place in the world
A37 0470 to fight a war- and they were probably right. "It would be like fighting
A37 0480 the French and Indian War all over again", said one military
A37 0490 man. But why was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground?
A37 0500    At Geneva in 1954, to get the war in Indo-China settled, the
A37 0510 British and French gave in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands
A37 0520 and agreed to the setting up of a Communist state, North Viet
A37 0530 Nam- which then, predictably, became a base for Communist operations
A37 0540 against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos. The late Secretary
A37 0550 of State John Foster Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement
A37 0560 a specimen of appeasement, saw that resolution would be needed to
A37 0570 keep it from becoming a calamity for the West. He began the diplomatic
A37 0580 discussions that resulted in the establishment of ~SEATO.
A37 0590 "The important thing from now on", he said, "is not to mourn the
A37 0600 past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern
A37 0610 Viet Nam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout
A37 0620 Southeast Asia".   Russian tanks and artillery parading through
A37 0630 the streets of Havana, Russian intrigue in the Congo, and Russian
A37 0640 arms drops in Laos (using the same Ilyushin transports that were
A37 0650 used to carry Communist agents to the Congo) made it plain once more
A37 0660 that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time. Soviet Premier
A37 0670 Khrushchev sent New Year's hopes for peace to President-elect
A37 0680 Kennedy, and got a cool acknowledgment in reply. Considering the
A37 0690 state of the whole world, the cold war's three exposed fronts did
A37 0700 not seem terribly ominous; but, in Senator Gore's words, it was
A37 0710 "not a very encouraging" situation that would confront John F&
A37 0720 Kennedy on Inauguration Day. #THE CONGRESS# _TURMOIL IN THE
A37 0730 HOUSE_ As the 87th Congress began its sessions last week, liberal
A37 0740 Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled
A37 0750 by the House Rules Committee and permit the free flow of liberal
A37 0760 legislation to the floor. The liberal pressure bloc (which coyly
A37 0770 masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group) had fought the
A37 0780 committee before, and had always lost. This time, they were much better
A37 0790 prepared and organized, and the political climate was favorable.
A37 0800 They had the unspoken support of President-elect Kennedy, whose own
A37 0810 legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee bottleneck.
A37 0820 And counting noses, they seemed to have the votes to work their will.
A37 0830 _DEADLY DEADLOCK._ There were two possible methods of breaching
A37 0840 the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee: 1) to pack
A37 0850 it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock,
A37 0860 or 2) to remove one of the conservatives- namely Mississippi's
A37 0870 14-term William Meyers Colmer (pronounced Calmer). Caucusing, the
A37 0880 liberals decided to go after Colmer, which actually was the more drastic
A37 0890 course, since seniority in the House is next to godliness.
A37 0900    A dour, gangling man with a choppy gait, Colmer looks younger than
A37 0910 his 70 years, has gradually swung from a moderate, internationalist
A37 0915 position
A37 0920 to that of a diehard conservative. He is generally and initially
A37 0930 suspicious of any federal project, unless it happens to benefit his
A37 0940 Gulf Coast constituents. He is, of course, a segregationist, but
A37 0950 he says he has never made an "anti-Negro" speech. For 20 years he
A37 0960 has enjoyed his power on the Rules Committee. There his vote, along
A37 0970 with those of Chairman Howard Smith, the courtly Virginia judge,
A37 0980 and the four Republican members, could and often did produce a 6-6
A37 0985 deadlock that blocked far-out,
A37 0990 Democratic-sponsored welfare legislation
A37 1000 (a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership
A37 1010 to avoid embarrassing votes). _EQUAL TREATMENT._ There was
A37 1020 sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's ouster: he had given his
A37 1030 lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy electors in Mississippi. Reprisals
A37 1040 are not unheard of in such situations, but the recent tendency has
A37 1050 been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons. In 1949 the Dixiecrats
A37 1060 escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry
A37 1065 Truman, and in 1957,
A37 1070 after Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned
A37 1080 for Dwight Eisenhower in 1956, his fellow Democrats did not touch
A37 1090 his committee assignments, although they did strip him temporarily
A37 1100 of his patronage. (In the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week,
A37 1105 Judge
A37 1110 Smith threatened reprisal against Powell. Said he: "We will
A37 1120 see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here".)
A37 1130 But Speaker Sam Rayburn, after huddling in Palm Beach with
A37 1140 President-elect Kennedy, decided that this year something had to be
A37 1150 done about the Rules Committee- and that he was the only man who could
A37 1160 do anything effective.   In a tense, closed-door session with
A37 1170 Judge Smith, Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise: to add
A37 1180 three new members to the Rules Committee (two Democrats, including
A37 1190 one Southerner, and one Republican). Smith flatly rejected the offer,
A37 1200 and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels. The next
A37 1210 morning he summoned a group of top Democrats to his private office and
A37 1220 broke the news: he would lead the fight to oust Colmer, whom he
A37 1230 is said to regard as "an inferior man".   News of
A37 1235 Rayburn's
A37 1240 commitment soon leaked out. When Missouri's Clarence Cannon got
A37 1250 the word, he turned purple. "Unconscionable"! he shouted, and
A37 1260 rushed off to the Speaker's Room to object: "A dangerous precedent"!
A37 1270 Cannon, a powerful, conservative man, brought welcome support
A37 1280 to the Smith-Colmer forces: as chairman of the Appropriations
A37 1290 Committee, he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding
A37 1300 this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects.
A37 1310 Sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another Judge
A37 1320 Smith ally, Georgia's Carl Vinson, chairman of the Armed Services
A37 1330 Committee. _THREAT OF WAR._ As the battle raged in the cloakrooms
A37 1340 and caucuses, it became clear that Judge Smith could lose. His
A37 1350 highest count of supporters numbered 72- and he needed nearly twice
A37 1360 that number to control the 260-member Democratic caucus. The liberals,
A37 1370 smelling blood, were faced with the necessity of winning three
A37 1380 big votes- in the Democratic Committee on Committees, in the full
A37 1390 party caucus, and on the floor of the House- before they could oust
A37 1400 Colmer. (One big question: If Colmer was to be purged, what should
A37 1410 the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported
A37 1420 the maverick electors?) In all three arenas, they seemed certain
A37 1430 of victory- especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash.
A37 1440    But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter
A37 1450 of losing a costlier war. If the Southerners were sufficiently aroused,
A37 1460 they could very well cut the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons
A37 1470 from their vantage point of committee chairmanships, leaving Sam
A37 1480 Rayburn leading a truncated, unworkable party. With that possibility
A37 1490 in mind, Arkansas' Wilbur Mills deliberately delayed calling a
A37 1500 meeting of the Committee on Committees, and coolheaded Democrats sought
A37 1510 to bring Rayburn and Smith together again to work out some sort
A37 1520 of face-saving compromise. "Here are two old men, mad at each other
A37 1530 and too proud to pick up the phone", said a House Democratic leader.
A37 1540 "One wants a little more power, and the other doesn't want
A37 1550 to give up any". _BATTLE IN THE SENATE_ The Senate launched the
A37 1560 87th Congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative
A37 1570 battle, but in contrast with the House's guerrilla war it seemed
A37 1580 as <pro forma> as a Capitol guide's speech. Question at issue:
A37 1590 How big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate- and
A37 1600 thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters?   A wide-ranging,
A37 1610 bipartisan force- from Minnesota's Democratic Hubert Humphrey
A37 1620 to Massachusetts' Republican Leverett Saltonstall- was
A37 1630 drawn up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats, who have traditionally
A37 1640 used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills. New Mexico's
A37 1650 Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change the Senate's
A37 1660 notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the Senators present and
A37 1670 voting to cut off debate, instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds.
A37 1680 Fair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante, asked cloture power for a
A37 1690 mere majority of Senators. Georgia's Dick Russell objected politely,
A37 1700 and the battle was joined.   Privately, the liberals admitted
A37 1710 that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage. Privately,
A37 1720 they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's three-fifths
A37 1730 modification depended on none other than Republican Richard Nixon.
A37 1740 In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of
A37 1750 Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each
A37 1760 new Congress, and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were
A37 1770 not binding.   Armed with the Nixon opinion, the Senate liberals
A37 1780 rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate
A37 1790 on the filibuster battle this week. Hopefully, the perennial battle
A37 1800 of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all. #REPUBLICANS#
A37 1810 _LAST ACT_ Since Election Day, Vice President
A37 1820 Richard Nixon had virtually retired- by his own wish- from public
A37 1830 view. But with the convening of the new Congress, he was the public
A37 1840 man again, presiding over the Senate until John Kennedy's Inauguration.
A37 1850 One day last week, Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore
A37 1860 that required him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to
A37 1870 hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote, and then to
A37 1880 make "sufficient declaration" of the election of the man who defeated
A37 1890 him in the tight 1960 presidential election. Nixon fulfilled his
A37 1900 assignment with grace, then went beyond the required "sufficient declaration".
A37 1910    "This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate
A37 1920 for the presidency announced the result of an election in which
A37 1930 he was defeated", he said.
A38 0010    The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do
A38 0020 to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves. Gary Player, the small,
A38 0030 trim South African, was the eventual winner, but in all his 25
A38 0040 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the
A38 0050 victory to drop in his lap. Arnold Palmer, the defending champion, lost
A38 0060 his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that
A38 0070 left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief.   "Just when you
A38 0080 think you have it licked, this golf course can get up and bite you",
A38 0090 Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament. And
A38 0100 that is just what happened on the last few holes. The Augusta National
A38 0110 Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer.
A38 0120    Player was the first to feel its teeth. After playing a splendid first
A38 0130 nine holes in 34- two strokes under par- on this fifth and final
A38 0140 day of the tournament (Sunday's fourth round had been washed out
A38 0150 by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed), Player's
A38 0160 game rapidly fell to pieces. He bogeyed the 10th. After a journey through
A38 0170 woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th. He bogeyed the 15th
A38 0180 by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three
A38 0190 holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total
A38 0200 of 280.   As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course,
A38 0210 Player was almost in tears. He could read on the nearby scoreboard
A38 0220 that Palmer, by then playing the 15th hole, was leading him by a stroke.
A38 0230 Palmer had started the round four strokes behind Player, and at
A38 0240 one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes. Now
A38 0250 all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the
A38 0260 biggest single paycheck in golf.   When Palmer hit a good straight
A38 0270 drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole, he seemed to have the championship
A38 0280 won. But the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green
A38 0290 strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression. In trying to
A38 0300 hit it out with a sand wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green,
A38 0310 past spectators and down the slope toward a ~TV tower.   Afterwards,
A38 0320 Palmer told Charlie Coe, his last-round partner, that he
A38 0330 simply played the hole too fast. He did seem hasty on his second and
A38 0340 third shots, but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while
A38 0350 Coe graciously putted out, giving Palmer a chance to recover his
A38 0355 composure,
A38 0360 which he had quite visibly lost.   When the shaken Palmer
A38 0370 finally did hit his fourth shot, he overshot the hole by 15 feet.
A38 0380 Palmer was now putting merely for a tie, and Player, who was sitting
A38 0390 beside his wife and watching it all on television in Tournament Chairman
A38 0400 Clifford Roberts' clubhouse apartment, stared in amazement when
A38 0410 Palmer missed the putt.   Palmer's 281 for the four rounds
A38 0420 at Augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest
A38 0430 pro, but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with Coe.
A38 0440 The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur, who has been playing topnotch
A38 0450 tournament golf for many years, refused to let the Masters jitters
A38 0460 overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69. #END
A38 0470 AT SEVEN# Until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played
A38 0480 seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters- four last year
A38 0490 and three this- without ever being out of first place. As evening
A38 0500 approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing
A38 0510 one-over-par 73, this remarkable record was still intact, thanks to
A38 0520 his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69. His three-round total
A38 0530 of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score, a 213 by Bill
A38 0540 Collins, the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing
A38 0550 very well all winter long.   But Palmer knew, as did everybody
A38 0560 else at Augusta, that his streak was about to be broken. Half an hour
A38 0570 after he finished his round, Player holed out at the 18th green with
A38 0580 a 69 and a three-round total of 206, four strokes ahead of Palmer.
A38 0590    More than a streak had ended. Long after the erratic climate
A38 0600 and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological
A38 0610 footnotes, the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the
A38 0620 <mano a mano> between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player. Unlike most
A38 0630 such sports rivalries, it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously,
A38 0640 although this was not exactly the case.   When the winter
A38 0650 tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to
A38 0660 challenge Palmer's towering prestige. As if to confirm his stature,
A38 0670 he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments. Player won only
A38 0680 one. But as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago, Player was
A38 0690 leading Palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars, and the
A38 0700 rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere. On the final round at
A38 0710 Pensacola, the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same
A38 0720 threesome and, although it was far from obvious at the time, the gallery
A38 0730 was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of
A38 0740 the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come.   On
A38 0750 that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading
A38 0760 the tournament and, as it turned out, neither won it. But whichever
A38 0770 of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial
A38 0780 leader of the tour. Player immediately proved he was not in the
A38 0790 least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer. He outplayed Palmer
A38 0800 all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's
A38 0810 71. Thereafter, until the Masters, Player gradually increased
A38 0820 his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory
A38 0830 at Miami. When they reached Augusta last week, together they had
A38 0840 won five of the 13 tournaments to date. #INSTANT RIVALRY# On Thursday,
A38 0850 the first day of the Masters, the contest between Palmer and
A38 0860 Player developed instantly. It was a dismal, drizzly day but a good
A38 0870 one on which to score over the Augusta National course. The usually
A38 0880 skiddy greens were moist and soft, so the golfers were able to strike
A38 0890 their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward
A38 0900 the hole without too much worry about the consequences. Palmer's 4-under-par
A38 0910 68 got him off to an early lead, which he shared with Bob Rosburg.
A38 0920 But Player was only one stroke back, with a 69.   Even
A38 0930 so, it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators-
A38 0940 unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever- that this tournament
A38 0950 was to be, essentially, a match between Palmer and Player. A lot
A38 0960 of people were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus, the spectacular
A38 0970 young amateur, who had a 70; or Ken Venturi, who had a somewhat shaky
A38 0980 72 but was bound to do better; or Rosburg, whose accurate short
A38 0990 game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries;
A38 1000 or even old Byron Nelson, whose excellent 71 made one
A38 1010 wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf. (On Thursday
A38 1020 nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe.)   On
A38 1030 Friday, a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and
A38 1040 ugly, the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus. Rosburg
A38 1050 had started early in the day, and by the time Palmer and Player were
A38 1060 on the course- separated, as they were destined to be for the rest
A38 1070 of the weekend,
A38 1080 by about half an hour- they could see on the numerous
A38 1090 scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg, who ended with a
A38 1100 73, was not having a good day.   As Player began his second round
A38 1110 in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman, his share of the gallery
A38 1120 was not conspicuously large for a contender. Player began with a birdie
A38 1130 on the first hole, added five straight pars and then another birdie
A38 1140 at the 9th. On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of
A38 1150 a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament. He birdied
A38 1160 the 13th, the 15th and the 18th- five birdies, one bogey and 12 pars
A38 1170 for a 68.   Starting half an hour behind Player in company with
A38 1180 British Open Champion Kel Nagle, Palmer birdied the 2nd, the
A38 1190 9th, the 13th and the 16th- four birdies, one bogey and 13 pars for
A38 1200 a 69. The roar of Palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would
A38 1210 roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta, only to be answered
A38 1220 moments later by the roar of Player's gallery for a similar triumph.
A38 1230 At one point late in the day, when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot
A38 1240 putt on the 16th, a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th
A38 1250 green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole.
A38 1260 Without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed
A38 1270 (although he later admitted that he had) Palmer proceeded to sink
A38 1280 his 25-footer, and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling
A38 1290 back along the intervening fairways in reply. #THE BOLDNESS OF CHAMPIONS#
A38 1300 Anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way
A38 1310 had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing
A38 1320 this most difficult golf course. It is almost axiomatic that golfers
A38 1330 who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots
A38 1340 with a vehemence bordering on violence. The bad luck that can so often
A38 1350 mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated
A38 1360 by the contemptuous boldness of these champions. Bob Jones played
A38 1370 that way. Byron Nelson did, Hogan did. And last week at the Masters
A38 1380 Palmer and Player did.   As the third round of the tournament
A38 1390 began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest, it was Player's
A38 1400 superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead. This
A38 1410 day Palmer had started first. As Player stepped on the first tee
A38 1420 he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was
A38 1430 2 under par for the day. Player immediately proceeded to follow suit.
A38 1440 In fact, he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well, to go 4 under
A38 1450 par for the first eight holes.   But Player's real test came
A38 1460 on the ninth hole, a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards.
A38 1470 He hit a poor tee shot, pulling it off into the pine woods separating
A38 1480 the 9th and first fairways. Having hit one of the trees, the ball came
A38 1490 to rest not more than 160 yards out. Player then had the choice of
A38 1500 punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling
A38 1510 for a bogey 5, or gambling. The latter involved hitting a full
A38 1520 four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse, hoping to
A38 1530 slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green.   "I was hitting
A38 1540 the ball well", Player said later, "and I felt strong. When
A38 1550 you're playing like that you'd better attack".   Player attacked
A38 1560 with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever
A38 1570 forget. It struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the
A38 1580 edge. From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4.
A38 1590    Palmer, meanwhile, had been having his troubles. They started on
A38 1600 the 4th hole, a 220-yard par-3. On this day the wind had switched 180`
A38 1610 from the northwest to the southeast, and nearly every shot on the
A38 1620 course was different from the previous few days. At the 4th tee Palmer
A38 1630 chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club, so
A38 1640 he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green. His bogey 4 on this
A38 1650 hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought
A38 1660 him back to even par.   Starting the second nine, Palmer was
A38 1670 already four strokes behind Player and knew it.
A39 0010    When Mickey Charles Mantle, the New York Yankees' man
A39 0020 of muscle, drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers, his feat touches
A39 0030 upon the sublime. When Roger Eugene Maris, Mantle's muscular
A39 0040 teammate, powers four home runs in a double-header, his performance
A39 0050 merits awe. But when tiny, 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the
A39 0060 Los Angeles Angels, who once caught three straight fly balls in center
A39 0070 field because, as a teammate explained, "the other team thought
A39 0080 no one was out there", hits seven home runs in four months (three
A39 0090 more than his total in 1958, 1959, and 1960), his achievement borders
A39 0100 on the ridiculous. This is Baseball 1961. This is the year home runs
A39 0110 ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous.   It is the year when
A39 0120 (1) amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the
A39 0130 plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and, in unprecedented
A39 0140 style, delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs; (2) Willie Mays
A39 0150 of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became
A39 0160 the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game; (3) the
A39 0170 Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs
A39 0180 in three games and lost two of them; and (4) catcher Johnny Blanchard
A39 0190 of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four
A39 0200 successive times at bat, two of them as a pinch-hitter.   Pitchers
A39 0210 grumble about lively balls and lively bats, the shrinking strike
A39 0220 zone, and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal. Experts
A39 0230 point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused
A39 0240 by expansion. Whatever the reasons, not in 30 years has a single season
A39 0250 produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records,
A39 0260 home-run division.   Of all the records in peril, one stands
A39 0270 apart, dramatic in its making, dramatic in its endurance, and now,
A39 0280 doubly dramatic in its jeopardy. This, of course, is baseball's most
A39 0290 remarkable mark: The 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible
A39 0300 epicure, the incredible athlete, George Herman (Babe) Ruth of the
A39 0310 Yankees.   Since 1927, fewer than a dozen men have made serious
A39 0320 runs at Babe Ruth's record and each, in turn, has been thwarted.
A39 0330 What ultimately frustrated every challenger was Ruth's amazing September
A39 0340 surge. In the final month of the 1927 season, he hit seventeen
A39 0350 home runs, a closing spurt never matched. #DOUBLE THREAT:#
A39 0355 Always,
A39 0360 in the abortive attacks upon Ruth's record, one man alone- a
A39 0370 Jimmy Foxx (58 in 1932) or a Hank Greenberg (58 in 1938) or a Hack
A39 0380 Wilson (56 in 1930)- made the bid. But now, for the first time
A39 0390 since Lou Gehrig (with 47 home runs) spurred Ruth on in 1927, two men
A39 0400 playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60. Their names are Mantle
A39 0410 and Maris, their team is the Yankees, and their threat is real.
A39 0420    After 108 games in 1927, Ruth had 35 home runs. After 108
A39 0430 games in 1961, Mickey Mantle has 43, Roger Maris 41. Extend Mantle's
A39 0440 and Maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162
A39 0450 games, and, mathematically, each will hit more than 60 home runs. This
A39 0455 is the
A39 0460 great edge the two Yankees have going for them. To better Ruth's
A39 0470 mark, neither needs a spectacular September flourish. All Mantle
A39 0480 needs is eight more home runs in August and ten in September,
A39 0490 and he will establish a new record. In Ruth's day- and until this
A39 0500 year- the schedule was 154 games. Baseball commissioner Ford Frick
A39 0510 has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official unless it is
A39 0520 broken in 154 games.)   "Even on the basis of 154 games, this
A39 0530 is the ideal situation", insists Hank Greenberg, now vice-president
A39 0540 of the Chicago White Sox. "It has to be easier with two of them.
A39 0550 How can you walk Maris to get to Mantle"? #ROOMMATES:#
A39 0560 Neither Mantle nor Maris, understandably, will predict 60 home runs
A39 0570 for himself. Although both concede they would like to hit 60, they
A39 0580 stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote: "The
A39 0590 important thing is to win the pennant". But one thing is for certain:
A39 0600 There is no dissension between Mantle, the American League's
A39 0610 Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957, and Maris, the ~MVP
A39 0620 in 1960. Each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ("I hope Roger
A39 0630 hits 80", Mantle says), and each enjoys even more seeing himself
A39 0640 hit home runs ("and I hope I hit 81").   The sluggers get
A39 0650 along so well in fact, that with their families at home for the summer
A39 0660 (Mantle's in Dallas, Maris's in Kansas City), they are rooming
A39 0670 together. Mantle, Maris, and Bob Cerv, a utility outfielder, share
A39 0680 an apartment in Jamaica, Long Island, not far from New York
A39 0690 International Airport. The three pay $251 a month for four rooms (kitchen,
A39 0700 dining room, living room, and bedroom), with air-conditioning
A39 0710 and new modern furniture. Mantle and Cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom;
A39 0720 Maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room. They
A39 0730 divide up the household chores: Cerv does most of the cooking (breakfast
A39 0740 and sandwich snacks, with dinner out), Mantle supplies the
A39 0750 transportation (a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible), and Maris drives
A39 0760 the 25-minute course from the apartment house to Yankee Stadium.
A39 0770 Mantle, Maris, and Cerv probably share one major-league record already:
A39 0780 Among them, they have fifteen children- eight for Cerv, four
A39 0790 for Mantle, and three for Maris.   As roommates, teammates,
A39 0800 and home-run mates, Mantle, 29, who broke in with the Yankees ten years
A39 0810 ago, and Maris, 26, who came to the Yankees from Kansas City
A39 0820 two years ago, have strikingly similar backgrounds. Both were scholastic
A39 0830 stars in football, basketball, and baseball (Mantle in Commerce,
A39 0840 Okla&, Maris in Fargo, N&D&); as halfbacks, both came close
A39 0850 to playing football at the University of Oklahoma ("Sometimes
A39 0860 in the minors", Maris recalls, "I wished I had gone to Oklahoma").
A39 0870    To an extent, the two even look alike. Both have blue
A39 0880 eyes and short blond hair. Both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195
A39 0890 and 200 pounds, but Mantle, incredibly muscular (he has a 17-1/2-inch
A39 0900 neck), looks bigger. With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders,
A39 0910 both must have their clothes made to order. Maris purchases $100
A39 0920 suits from Simpson's in New York. Mantle, more concerned with
A39 0930 dress, buys his suits four at a time at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and
A39 0940 pays as much as $250 each. #LIGHT READING:# Neither Mantle nor
A39 0950 Maris need fear being classified an intellectual, but lately Mantle
A39 0960 has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus, Henry Miller's
A39 0970 "Tropic of Cancer". Mantle so appreciated Miller's delicate
A39 0980 literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive
A39 0990 passages aloud during road trips.   Mantle is not normally
A39 1000 given to public speaking- or, for that matter, to private speaking.
A39 1010 "What do you and Mickey talk about at home"? a reporter asked
A39 1020 Maris recently.   "To tell you the truth", Maris said, "Mickey
A39 1030 don't talk much".   This is no surprising trait for
A39 1040 a ballplayer. What is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris,
A39 1050 under constant pressure from writers and photographers, are trying
A39 1060 to be cooperative.   Of the two, Mantle is by nature the less
A39 1070 outgoing, Maris the more outspoken. But last week, when a reporter
A39 1080 was standing near Mantle's locker, Mickey walked up and volunteered
A39 1090 an anecdote. "See that kid"? he said, pointing to a dark-haired
A39 1100 11-year-old boy. "That's [Yogi] Berra's. I'll never
A39 1110 forget one time I struck out three times, dropped a fly ball, and we
A39 1120 lost the game. I came back, sitting by my locker, feeling real low,
A39 1130 and the kid walks over to me, looks up, and says: 'You stunk'".
A39 1140    Maris, in talking to reporters, tries to answer all questions
A39 1150 candidly and fully, but on rare occasions, he shuns newsmen. "When
A39 1160 I've made a dumb play", he says, "I don't want to talk to
A39 1170 anyone. I'm angry".   By his own confession, Maris is an
A39 1180 angry young man. Benched at Tulsa in 1955, he told manager Dutch Meyer:
A39 1190 "I can't play for you. Send me where I can play". (Meyer
A39 1200 sent him to Reading, Pa&.) Benched at Indianapolis in 1956,
A39 1210 he told manager Kerby Farrell: "I'm not learning anything on
A39 1220 the bench. Play me". (Farrell did- and Maris led the team to victory
A39 1230 in the Little World Series.) "That's the way I am",
A39 1240 he says. "I tell people what I think. If you're a good ballplayer,
A39 1250 you've got to get mad. Give me a team of nine angry men and I'll
A39 1260 give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of
A39 1270 ten times". #IDOLS' IDOLS:# One good indication of the two
A39 1280 men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes.
A39 1290 Maris's was Ted Williams. "When I was a kid", Maris
A39 1300 told a sportswriter last week, "I used to follow Williams every day
A39 1310 in the box score, just to see whether he got a hit or not".
A39 1320    "When you came up to the majors, did you seek out Williams for advice"?
A39 1330    "Are you kidding"? said Maris. "You're
A39 1340 afraid to talk to a guy you idolize".   Mantle's hero was Joe
A39 1350 DiMaggio. "When Mickey went to the Yankees", says Mark Freeman,
A39 1360 an ex-Yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver, "DiMaggio
A39 1370 still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker,
A39 1380 just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man, this
A39 1390 hero of his. But DiMaggio never said a word. It crushed Mickey.
A39 1400 He told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star, this
A39 1410 never would be said of him". Mantle has kept the vow. Among all
A39 1420 the Yankees, he is the veteran most friendly to rookies.   Neither
A39 1430 Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else.
A39 1440 If laying ties on a railroad track, which he once did for $1 an hour,
A39 1450 paid more than playing right field for the Yankees, Maris would
A39 1460 lay ties on a railroad track. If working in a zinc mine, which he once
A39 1470 did for 87-1/2 cents an hour, paid more than playing center field for
A39 1480 the Yankees, Mantle would work in a zinc mine. But since railroading
A39 1490 and mining are not the highest paid arts, Mantle and Maris concentrate
A39 1500 on baseball. They try to play baseball the best they can.
A39 1510    Each is a complete ballplayer. Mantle, beyond any question, can
A39 1520 do more things well. ("One of the reasons they get along fine",
A39 1530 says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men, "is that both
A39 1540 realize Mantle is head-and-shoulders above Maris".) Hitting,
A39 1550 Mantle
A39 1560 has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed,
A39 1570 Maris only left-handed. They both possess near classic
A39 1575 stances,
A39 1580 dug in firmly, arms high, set for fierce swings. Mantle is considerably
A39 1590 better hitting for average (.332, fourth in the league, to .280
A39 1600 for Maris so far this year).   Both are good bunters: Maris
A39 1610 once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues; Mantle
A39 1620 is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base. Both have brilliant
A39 1630 speed: Mantle was timed from home plate (batting left-handed) to
A39 1640 first base in 3.1 seconds, faster than any other major leaguer; Maris
A39 1650 ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a
A39 1660 race against Luis Aparicio, the swift, base-stealing shortstop of the
A39 1670 White Sox. Both are good, daring fielders: Mantle covers more
A39 1680 ground; Maris's throwing arm is stronger.   Yet with all their
A39 1690 skills, the appeal of Mantle and Maris in 1961 comes down to one
A39 1700 basic: The home run. With this ultimate weapon, the two Yankees
A39 1710 may have saved baseball from its dullest season. (American League expansion
A39 1720 created, inevitably, weaker teams. Only two teams in each league
A39 1730 [the Yankees and Detroit, the Dodgers and Cincinnati] are battling
A39 1740 for first place.   Appropriately, the emphasis on the home
A39 1750 run, at a peak this year, came into being at baseball's lowest moment.
A39 1760 In 1920, as the startling news that the 1919 White Sox had conspired
A39 1770 to lose the World Series leaked out, fans grew disillusioned
A39 1780 and disinterested in baseball. Something was needed to revive interest;
A39 1790 the something was the home run.
A40 0010    Into Washington on President-elect John F& Kennedy's
A40 0020 Convair, the <Caroline>, winged Actor-Crooner {Frank Sinatra}
A40 0030 and his close Hollywood pal, Cinemactor Peter Lawford, Jack
A40 0040 Kennedy's brother-in-law. Also included in the entourage: a dog
A40 0050 in a black sweater, Frankie and Peter had an urgent mission: to stage
A40 0060 a mammoth Inauguration Eve entertainment gala in the capital's
A40 0070 National Guard Armory. Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas, as
A40 0080 he had hinted upon his arrival: "It's really tremendous when you
A40 0090 think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia. I could talk to
A40 0100 you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans"!
A40 0110 As the plans were laid, some several thousand fat cats were to
A40 0120 be ensconced in the armory's $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced
A40 0130 at $10,000 each. The biggest single act would doubtless be staged
A40 0140 by Frankie himself: his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by
A40 0150 Hollywood Couturier Don Loper, who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles.
A40 0160 Soon after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered
A40 0170 "two of everything" just "in case he spills anything", Frankie
A40 0180 got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch
A40 0190 of Loper clothing. @ ## A year after he was catapulted over
A40 0200 nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps,
A40 0210 General {David M& Shoup} delivered a peppery annual report
A40 0220 in the form of a "happy, warless New Year" greeting to his
A40 0230 Pentagon staff. Said Leatherneck Shoup: "A year ago I took the
A40 0240 grips of the plow in my hands. After pushing an accumulation of vines
A40 0250 and weeds from the moldboard, I lifted the lines from the dust and
A40 0260 found hitched to that plow the finest team I ever held a rein on. Little
A40 0270 geeing and hawing have been necessary". But Shoup also gave
A40 0280 the Corps a tilling in spots. Speaking of "pride", he deplored
A40 0290 the noncommissioned officer "whose uniform looks like it belonged to
A40 0300 someone who retired in 1940; the officer with the yellow socks or
A40 0310 the bay window. A few of these people are still around". @ ##
A40 0320 Old and new briefly crossed paths in the U&S& Senate, then

A40 0370 Ambassador-designate to the U&N&. Meanwhile, after 24 years
A40 0380 in the Senate, Rhode Island's durable Democrat {Theodore
A40 0390 Francis Greene}- having walked, swum and cerebrated himself to
A40 0400 the hearty age of 93- left that august body (voluntarily, because he
A40 0410 could surely have been re-elected had he chosen to run again last November),
A40 0420 as the oldest man ever to serve in the Senate. @ ## The
A40 0430 most famous undergraduate of South Philadelphia High School is
A40 0440 a current bobby-sox idol, Dreamboat Cacophonist {Fabian} (real
A40 0450 name: Fabian Forte), 17, and last week it developed that he will remain
A40 0460 an undergraduate for a while. The principal of the school announced
A40 0470 that- despite the help of private tutors in Hollywood and Philadelphia-
A40 0480 Fabian is a 10-o'clock scholar in English and mathematics.
A40 0490 Lacking his needed credits in those subjects, Fabian will not
A40 0500 graduate with his old classmates next week. South Philadelphia High's
A40 0510 principal added that the current delay was caused by the "pressure"
A40 0520 of a movie that the toneless lad was making. @ ## To Decathlon

A40 0700 Khrushchev's most enthusiastic eulogizers, the U&S&S&R&'s
A40 0710 daily <Izvestia>, enterprisingly interviewed Red-prone Comedian
A40 0720 {Charlie Chaplin} at his Swiss villa, where he has been in
A40 0730 self-exile since 1952. Chaplin, 71, who met K& when the Soviet boss
A40 0740 visited England in 1956, confided that he hopes to visit Russia
A40 0750 some time this summer because "I have marveled at your grandiose experiment
A40 0760 and I believe in your future". Then Charlie spooned out
A40 0770 some quick impressions of the Nikita he had glimpsed: "I was captivated
A40 0780 by his humor, frankness and good nature and by his kind, strong
A40 0790 and somewhat sly face".
A40 0800    G& David Thompson is one of those names known to the stewards
A40 0810 of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in Europe's best hotels,
A40 0820 but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town
A40 0830 of Pittsburgh. There the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth, a
A40 0840 reputation for eccentricity, and an ardor for collecting art. Last week,
A40 0850 in the German city of Du^sseldorf, G& David Thompson was
A40 0860 making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pause. On display were
A40 0870 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection-
A40 0880 and every single one of them was up for sale.   Like Philadelphia's
A40 0890 late Dr& Albert C& Barnes who kept his own great collection
A40 0900 closed to the general public (TIME, Jan& 2), Thompson,
A40 0910 at 61, is something of a legend in his own lifetime. He made his
A40 0920 fortune during World War /2, when he took over a number of dying
A40 0930 steel plants and kept them alive until the boom. Even before he hit
A40 0940 big money, he had begun buying modern paintings. He gave the impression
A40 0950 of never having read a word about art, but there was no doubt that
A40 0960 he had an eye for the best.   He was able to smell a bargain-
A40 0970 and a masterpiece- a continent away, and the Museum of Modern Art's
A40 0980 Alfred Barr said of him: "I have never mentioned a new artist
A40 0990 that Thompson didn't know about". He might barge into a gallery,
A40 1000 start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting.
A40 1010 He could be lavishly generous with friends, cab drivers and bellboys,
A40 1020 but with dealers he was tough. He bought up Cezannes, Braques, Matisses,
A40 1030 Legers, a splendid Picasso series, more than 70 Giacometti
A40 1040 sculptures. He gathered one of the biggest collections of Paul Klees
A40 1050 in the world. All these he hung in his burglarproof home called Stone's
A40 1060 Throw, outside Pittsburgh, and only people he liked and trusted
A40 1070 ever got to see them.   Two years ago Thompson offered his
A40 1080 collection to the city. But he insisted that it be housed in a special
A40 1090 museum. Pittsburgh turned him down, just as Pittsburgh society had
A40 1100 been snubbing him for years. He went then to a 40-year-old Basel art
A40 1110 dealer named Ernst Beyeler, with whom he had long been trading pictures.
A40 1120 Last year Beyeler arranged to sell $1,500,000 worth of Klees
A40 1130 to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which will house them in
A40 1140 a museum that is yet to be built. Last week most of the other prizes,
A40 1150 once offered to Pittsburgh, went on the block.   At the opening
A40 1160 of the Du^sseldorf show, Thompson himself scarcely glanced at the
A40 1170 treasures that he was seeing together for the last time. In fact he
A40 1180 seemed delighted to get rid of them. Some observers speculated that
A40 1190 this might be his revenge on his home town. Thompson himself said:
A40 1200 "I want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new
A40 1210 pictures".
A40 1220 #BREAK IN GEORGIA# The University of Georgia has long claimed that
A40 1230 it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis
A40 1240 of race or color. But in all its 175 years, not a single Negro
A40 1250 student has entered its classrooms. Last week Federal District Judge
A40 1260 William A& Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately
A40 1270 a "qualified" Negro boy and girl. Their entry will crack the
A40 1280 total segregation of all public education, from kindergarten through graduate
A40 1290 school, in Georgia- and in Alabama, Mississippi and South
A40 1300 Carolina as well.   For 18 months, Hamilton Holmes, 19, and
A40 1310 Charlayne Hunter, 18, had tried to get into the university. They graduated
A40 1320 together from Atlanta's Turner High School, where Valedictorian
A40 1330 Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne third. The university
A40 1340 rejected them on a variety of pretexts, but was careful never
A40 1350 to mention the color of their skins. Holmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse
A40 1360 (Negro) College, where he is a B+ student and star halfback.
A40 1370 Charlayne studied journalism at Detroit's Wayne State University.
A40 1380 Last fall, after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to
A40 1390 court, Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again.   Charlayne
A40 1400 was "tentatively" admitted for next fall, after state investigators
A40 1410 questioned her white roommate at Wayne State. But Holmes was rejected
A40 1420 again "on the basis of his record and interview". The evidence
A40 1430 in court was testimony about the interview, which for Holmes lasted
A40 1440 an hour, although at least one white student at Georgia got through
A40 1450 this ritual by a simple phone conversation. Holmes was asked if he
A40 1460 had ever visited a house of prostitution, or a "beatnik parlor or teahouse".
A40 1470 No, said he, but officials still called him "evasive".
A40 1480 They also said he lied in saying that he had never been "arrested".
A40 1490 Their reason: Holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine, had his license
A40 1500 suspended.   Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white
A40 1510 students, found that many were hardly interviewed at all- and few
A40 1520 had academic records as good as Hamilton Holmes. The real reason
A40 1530 for his rejection, they argued, is the fact that Georgia law automatically
A40 1540 cuts off funds for any desegregated school.   Judge Bootle's
A40 1550 decision: "The two plaintiffs are qualified for admission
A40 1560 to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been
A40 1570 for their race and color". The state will appeal- but few think
A40 1580 it will actually try to close the university. "Surprised and pleased",
A40 1590 Students Holmes and Hunter may enter the University of Georgia
A40 1595 this week. #CATCH FOR CHICAGO# When the University of
A40 1600 Chicago's Chancellor Lawrence A& Kimpton
A40 1610 submitted his resignation last March, a mighty talent hunt
A40 1620 gripped the Midway. Out went letters to 60,000 old grads, asking for
A40 1630 suggestions. Such academic statesmen as James B& Conant were consulted.
A40 1640 Two committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors, including
A40 1650 Adlai Stevenson, Richard Nixon, and Harvard's Dean McGeorge
A40 1660 Bundy. The debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither
A40 1670 a big name nor an experienced academic administrator, but rather,
A40 1680 as Trustee Chairman Glen A& Lloyd put it, "a top scholar in
A40 1690 his own right"- a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago.
A40 1700    Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech's
A40 1710 acting dean of the faculty: dynamic Geneticist George Wells
A40 1720 Beadle, 57, who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology
A40 1730 for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell
A40 1740 chemistry (TIME, Cover, July 14, 1958).   It fell to Chancellor
A40 1750 Kimpton, now a Standard Oil (Indiana) executive, to spend
A40 1760 his nine-year reign tidying up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of
A40 1770 Idealist Robert Maynard Hutchins. He threw out some of Hutchins'
A40 1780 more wildly experimental courses, raised sagging undergraduate enrollment
A40 1790 to 2,100, nearly doubled endowment to $139.3 million. But though
A40 1800 Kimpton put Chicago in what he felt was working order, some old grads
A40 1810 feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it
A40 1820 in the heady Hutchins era.   At Caltech, Geneticist Beadle
A40 1830 has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology
A40 1840 division since 1946. But he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot,
A40 1850 recruit and excite able researchers, and has developed unexpected
A40 1860 talents in fund raising and speech-making. Beadle is even that rare
A40 1865 scientist
A40 1870 who takes an interest in money matters; he avidly reads the
A40 1880 <Wall Street Journal>, and took delight in driving a $250 model ~A
A40 1890 Ford for 22 years, then selling it for $300.
A41 0010    A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began
A41 0020 with the old Adam and consequently will never end. But a historian
A41 0030 might put his finger on a specific man and date, and hold out the hope
A41 0040 that the troubles will sometime pass away. The man was King Leopold
A41 0050 /2, of the Belgians, who in 1885 concluded that he had better
A41 0060 grab a colony while the grabbing was still good. By force, he took under
A41 0070 his protection, or stole, 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central
A41 0080 Africa. This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe;
A41 0090 and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political
A41 0100 or historical unity. Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography
A41 0110 or ethnic groupings; they were determined by the points at which Leopold's
A41 0120 explorers and gunmen got tired of walking.   The population
A41 0130 of the Congo is 13.5 million, divided into at least seven major
A41 0140 "culture clusters" and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate
A41 0150 dialects. The religions of the people include Christianity, Mohammedanism,
A41 0160 paganism, ancestor worship and animism. The climate ranges from
A41 0170 the steamily equatorial to the temperate. The hospitals contain patients
A41 0180 trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars. To make one
A41 0190 nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any
A41 0200 case; it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have
A41 0210 done, or failed to do, in the Congo since 1885.   At first the
A41 0220 Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private property.
A41 0230 But by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience.
A41 0240 The Belgian government itself took over administration, commencing
A41 0250 a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism.
A41 0260 One definition of paternalism is "The principle or practice,
A41 0270 on the part of a government, of managing the affairs of a country in
A41 0280 the manner of a father dealing with his children". The honor of the
A41 0290 Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned- only their judgment.
A41 0300 Ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time-
A41 0310 but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child,
A41 0320 if one imagines him to have been born in 1908, was 52 and had until
A41 0330 then been treated as an infant. ## The Belgians were interested
A41 0340 primarily in the economic development of the Congo, which is rich in
A41 0350 copper, tin, cobalt, manganese, zinc, and uranium, and cotton and palm
A41 0360 oil. The colony was administered from Brussels, with neither the
A41 0370 Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any vote. The beneficiaries
A41 0380 of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both
A41 0390 individuals and the Belgian government itself held stock. In <Inside
A41 0400 Africa>, John Gunther describes one of these, the Societe Generale,
A41 0410 as "the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if, let us
A41 0420 say, the House of Morgan, Anaconda Copper, the Mutual Life Insurance
A41 0430 Company of New York, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and various
A41 0440 companies producing agricultural products were lumped together, with
A41 0450 the United States <government> as a heavy partner".   Had
A41 0460 they been truly ruthless, the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese
A41 0470 without compassion. But they were not. They provided a social
A41 0480 security system which covered all their African employes; their program
A41 0490 of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent;
A41 0500 they put much effort into public housing. They also instituted a ration
A41 0510 system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish
A41 0520 their employes with clothing and adequate food. But instead of
A41 0530 delivering the ration- either in actual commodities or in cash- at
A41 0540 intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month, the Belgians felt obliged
A41 0560 to dole it out more often. Would not the children, if they received all
A41 0570 their food on the first day of the month, eat it up immediately, and
A41 0580 later go hungry?   The Belgians also placed great emphasis
A41 0590 on education. During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in
A41 0600 the Congo. But almost all the schools were primary. The average Congolese
A41 0610 can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of "<la chatte>"
A41 0620 and "<le chien>" and write his name. Some schools were
A41 0630 technical- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit
A41 0640 the land, and trained many. But they did not believe in widespread
A41 0650 secondary education, much less in college. It was their conviction
A41 0660 that the people should be "brought up together", a grade at a time,
A41 0670 until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history,
A41 0680 economics and political science. Indeed, the Belgians discouraged
A41 0690 higher education, fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite
A41 0700 which might cause unrest. When the Congo received its independence
A41 0710 in 1960 there were, among its 13.5 million people, exactly 14 university
A41 0720 graduates. ## Why did the Belgians grant independence to a
A41 0730 colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it? In one large oversimplification,
A41 0740 it might be said that the Belgians felt, far too late, the
A41 0750 gale of nationalism sweeping Africa. They lacked time to prepare
A41 0760 the Congo, as the British and French had prepared their colonies. The
A41 0770 Congolese were clamoring for their independence, even though most
A41 0780 were unsure what it meant; and in Brussels, street crowds shouted,
A41 0790 "<Pas une goutte de sang!>" (Not one drop of blood!). The
A41 0800 Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue;
A41 0810 rather than teach where teaching was not wanted, they would
A41 0820 wash their hands of the mess. It is hard to blame them for this. Yet
A41 0830 there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after
A41 0840 independence for which history may not find them guiltless.
A41 0850 As the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no
A41 0860 fewer than 120 political parties, or approximately eight for each university
A41 0870 graduate. There were four principal ones. First, there were those
A41 0880 Congolese (among them Joseph Kasavubu) who favored splitting the
A41 0890 country into small independent states, Balkanizing it. Second, there
A41 0900 were those (Moise Tshombe) who favored near-Balkanization, a loose
A41 0910 federalism having a central government of limited authority, with
A41 0920 much power residing in the states. Third, there were those (notably Patrice
A41 0930 Lumumba) who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central
A41 0940 government. And fourth, there were moderates who were in no hurry
A41 0950 for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up. However,
A41 0960 the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting.
A41 0970    A final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation
A41 0980 of the Congo, immediately after independence, was the provincial structure
A41 0990 that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration.
A41 1000 They had divided the Congo into six provinces- Leopoldville,
A41 1010 Kasai, Kivu, Katanga, Equator and Eastern- unfortunately
A41 1020 with little regard for ethnic groupings. Thus some provinces contained
A41 1030 tribes which detested each other, and to them independence meant
A41 1040 an opportunity for war.   The Belgian Congo was granted its independence
A41 1050 with what seemed a workable Western-style form of government:
A41 1060 there were to be a president and a premier, and a bicameral legislature
A41 1070 elected by universal suffrage in the provinces. Well-wishers
A41 1080 around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable
A41 1090 position in the society of nations. If internal frictions arose,
A41 1100 they could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army, the <Force
A41 1110 Publique>, which had been trained and was still officered by white
A41 1120 Belgians. The president, Joseph Kasavubu, seemed an able administrator
A41 1130 and the premier, Patrice Lumumba, a reasonable man.   Twenty-four
A41 1140 hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting
A41 1150 each other. Presently the well-armed members of the <Force Publique>-
A41 1170 many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes,
A41 1180 erupted in mutiny, rioting, raping and looting. Terror engulfed the thousands
A41 1190 of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country. The Belgian
A41 1200 government decided to act, and on July 10 dispatched paratroops
A41 1210 to the Congo. On July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of
A41 1220 Katanga, Moise Tshombe, announced that his province had seceded from
A41 1230 the country. Confusion became chaos; each succeeding day brought
A41 1240 new acts of violence. Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military
A41 1250 intervention by the Belgians, and appealed to the United Nations
A41 1260 to send troops to oust them. ## On July 14 the Security
A41 1265 Council-
A41 1270 with France and Great Britain abstaining- voted the resolution
A41 1280 which drew the U&N& into the Congo. Vague in wording, it
A41 1290 called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-General
A41 1300 "to take the necessary steps **h to provide the [Congolese]
A41 1310 Government with such military assistance as may be necessary, until,
A41 1320 through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical
A41 1330 assistance of the United Nations, the national security forces
A41 1340 may be able, in the opinion of the Government, to meet fully their tasks
A41 1350 **h".   Secretary-General Hammarskjo^ld decided that it
A41 1360 would be preferable if the U&N& troops sent into the Congo were
A41 1370 to come from African, or at least nonwhite, nations- certainly not
A41 1375 from the U&S&,
A41 1380 Russia, Great Britain or France. He quickly
A41 1390 called on Ghana, Tunisia, Morocco, Guinea and Mali, which dispatched
A41 1400 troops within hours. Ultimately the U&N& army in the Congo
A41 1410 reached a top strength of 19,000, including about 5,000 from India
A41 1420 and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden, who were the only whites.
A41 1430    It took the U&N& three months to bring a modest form of
A41 1440 order to the Congo. The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops
A41 1450 and often obstructed U&N& efforts. The wildly erratic nature
A41 1460 of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems- he frequently announced
A41 1470 that he wanted the U&N& to get out of the Congo along with
A41 1480 the Belgians, and appealed to Russia for help. (However, there is
A41 1490 little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist. Before appealing
A41 1500 to the U&N& or to Russia, he first appealed to the U&S&
A41 1510 for military help, and was rejected.) Lumumba further complicated
A41 1520 the U&N&'s mission by initiating small "wars" with the
A41 1530 secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which, under
A41 1540 Albert Kalonji, wanted to secede as well. Meanwhile Russia took every
A41 1550 opportunity to meddle in the Congo, sending Lumumba equipment for
A41 1560 his "wars", dispatching "technicians" and even threatening,
A41 1570 on occasion, to intervene openly.   But by the end of the three-month
A41 1580 period, in October 1960, something approaching calm settled on
A41 1590 the Congo. President Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and
A41 1600 fired him. Lumumba fired Kasavubu. Control of the government- such
A41 1610 control as there was and such government as there was- passed into
A41 1620 the hands of Joseph Mobutu, chief of staff of the Congolese army.
A41 1630 Mobutu promptly flung out the Russians, who have not since played any
A41 1640 significant part on the local scene, although they have redoubled their
A41 1650 obstructionist efforts at U&N& headquarters in New York.
A41 1660 The Belgians- at least officially- departed from the Congo as well,
A41 1670 withdrawing all of their uniformed troops. But they left behind
A41 1680 them large numbers of officers, variously called "volunteers" or
A41 1690 "mercenaries", who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga,
A41 1700 the seceded province which, according to Tshombe, holds 65% of
A41 1710 the mineral wealth of the entire country.   From October 1960
A41 1720 to February 1961, the U&N& forces in the Congo took little action.
A41 1730 There was no directive for it- the Security Council's resolution
A41 1740 had not mentioned political matters, and in any case the United
A41 1750 Nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political
A41 1760 affairs of any nation, whether to unify it, federalize it or Balkanize
A41 1770 it.   During the five-month lull, civil war smoldered and
A41 1780 flickered throughout the Congo. In February the murder of Patrice
A41 1790 Lumumba, who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of
A41 1800 Tshombe, again stirred the U&N& to action. On Feb& 21 the
A41 1810 council passed another resolution urging the taking of "all appropriate
A41 1820 measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo, including
A41 1830 **h the use of force, if necessary, in the last resort". Although
A41 1840 the resolution might have been far more specific, it was considerably
A41 1850 tougher than the earlier one. It also urged that the U&N&
A41 1860 eject, and prevent the return of, all Belgian and other foreign military
A41 1870 and political advisers; ordered an investigation of Lumumba's
A41 1880 death; urged the reconvention of the Congolese Parliament and the
A41 1890 reorganization of the army.
A42 0010 #THE PRESIDENCY: TALKING AND LISTENING# Though President John
A42 0020 F& Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin
A42 0030 and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev,
A42 0040 his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved
A42 0050 him in other key problems of U&S& foreign policy last week.
A42 0060    High up on the President's priority list was the thorny question
A42 0070 of Bizerte. On this issue, the President received a detailed
A42 0080 report from his U&N& Ambassador Adlai Stevenson, who had just
A42 0090 returned from Paris, and Mr& Kennedy asked Stevenson to search
A42 0095 for a face-saving
A42 0100 way- for both Paris and Tunis- out of the imbroglio.
A42 0110 Ideally, the President would like the French to agree on a "status
A42 0120 quo ante" on Bizerte, and accept a new timetable for withdrawing
A42 0130 their forces from the Mediterranean base. To continue their important
A42 0140 conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of
A42 0150 other problems, Mr& Kennedy invited stevenson to Cape Cod for
A42 0160 the weekend.
A42 0170    The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with
A42 0180 the No& 2 man in the Tunisian Government, Defense Minister Bahi
A42 0190 Ladgham, who flew to Washington last week to seek U&S& support.
A42 0200 The conversation apparently convinced Mr& Kennedy that the
A42 0210 positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable. Through Ladgham,
A42 0220 Mr& Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian
A42 0230 President Habib Bourguiba; and one U&S& official said: "The
A42 0240 key question now is which side picks up the phone first".
A42 0250    On the Latin American front, the President held talks with Secretary
A42 0260 of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay
A42 0270 and the Inter-American Economic and Social Council (which the President
A42 0280 himself had originally hoped to attend). Main purpose of the
A42 0290 meeting: To discuss President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress.
A42 0300    And that was not all. In conferences with Nationalist China's
A42 0310 dapper, diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng, Mr& Kennedy
A42 0320 assured Chiang Kai-shek's emissary that the U&S& is as
A42 0330 firmly opposed as ever to the admission of Red China to the United
A42 0340 Nations. Chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission
A42 0350 of Outer Mongolia; however the President, who would like to woo
A42 0360 the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow, would
A42 0370 promise Chen nothing more than an abstention by the U&S& if Outer
A42 0380 Mongolia's admission comes to a vote.   The President
A42 0390 also conferred with emissaries from Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking
A42 0400 more foreign aid. To Africa, he sent his most trusted adviser,
A42 0410 his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, on a good-will mission
A42 0420 to the Ivory Coast. All week long the President clearly was playing
A42 0430 a larger personal role in foreign affairs; in effect, he was practicing
A42 0440 what he preached in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he
A42 0445 declared:
A42 0450 "We shall always be prepared to discuss international problems
A42 0460 with any and all nations that are willing to talk, and listen, with
A42 0470 reason". #CRIME: 'SKYJACKED'# From International Airport
A42 0480 in Los Angeles to International Airport in Houston, as the
A42 0490 great four-jet Boeing 707 flies, is a routine five hours and 25 minutes,
A42 0500 including stopovers at Phoenix, El Paso, and San Antonio. When
A42 0510 Continental Airlines night-coach Flight 54 took off at 11:30 one
A42 0520 night last week, there was no reason to think it would take any longer.
A42 0530    The plane put down on schedule at 1:35 a&m& in Phoenix.
A42 0540 Thirty-one minutes later, when it took off for El Paso, hardly
A42 0550 anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention
A42 0560 to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard. At 3:58 a&m&,
A42 0570 with the plane about twenty minutes out of El Paso, passenger Robert
A42 0580 Berry, a San Antonio advertising man, glanced up and saw the
A42 0590 man and boy, accompanied by a stewardess, walking up the aisle toward
A42 0600 the cockpit. "The man was bent over with his hand on his stomach",
A42 0610 Berry said. "I figured he was sick".   John Salvador, a
A42 0620 farmer from Palm Desert, Calif&, was sitting up front and could
A42 0630 see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit. "The kid had
A42 0640 a .45 automatic, like they issue in the Army", he said. "The other
A42 0650 fellow had a .38". Salvador saw the youth hold his .45 against the
A42 0660 head of stewardess Lois Carnegey; the man put his .38 at the head
A42 0670 of Capt& Byron D& Rickards.   To Rickards, a 52-year-old
A42 0680 veteran 30 years in the air, it was an old story: His plane was
A42 0690 being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930, when
A42 0700 Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor at Arequipa. But
A42 0710 last week's pirates, like the Cuban-American who recently hijacked
A42 0720 an Eastern Airlines Electra (NEWSWEEK, Aug& 7), wanted to
A42 0730 go to Havana. _STALLING:_ "Tell your company there are four
A42 0740 of us here
A42 0750 with guns", the elder man told Rickards. The pilot radioed
A42 0760 El Paso International Airport with just that message. But, he
A42 0770 told the "skyjackers", the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach
A42 0780 Havana; they would have to refuel at El Paso.   Most passengers
A42 0790 didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground.
A42 0800 Jerry McCauley of Sacramento, Calif&, one of some twenty Air Force
A42 0810 recruits on board, awoke from a nap in confusion. "The old man
A42 0820 came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers
A42 0830 to go to Cuba", McCauley said, "and like a nut I raised my hand.
A42 0840 I thought he was the Air Force recruiter".   What the man
A42 0850 wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages, along with the crew.
A42 0860 They chose four: Jack Casey, who works for Continental Airlines
A42 0870 in Houston; Fred Mullen from Mercer Island, Wash&;
A42 0880 Pfc&
A42 0890 Truman Cleveland of St& Augustine. Fla&, and Leonard Gilman,
A42 0900 a former college boxer and veteran of the U&S& Immigration
A42 0910 Service Border Patrol. Everybody else was allowed to file off the
A42 0920 plane after it touched down at El Paso at 4:18 a&m&.
A42 0930 They found a large welcoming group- El Paso policemen, Border Patrol,
A42 0940 sheriff's deputies, and ~FBI men, who surged around the
A42 0950 plane with rifles and submarine guns. Other ~FBI men, talking with
A42 0960 the pilot from the tower, conspired with him to delay the proposed
A42 0970 flight to Havana. The ground crew, which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty
A42 0980 minutes, took fully three hours. Still more time was consumed while
A42 0990 the pilot, at the radioed suggestion of Continental president Robert
A42 1000 Six, tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for
A42 1010 a propeller-driven Douglas ~DC-7.   Actually, the officers
A42 1020 on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with
A42 1030 any kind of an airplane; they had orders to that effect straight
A42 1040 from President Kennedy, who thought at first, as did most others, that
A42 1050 it was four followers of Cuba's Fidel Castro who had taken over
A42 1060 the 707. Mr& Kennedy had been informed early in the day of the
A42 1070 attempt to steal the plane, kept in touch throughout by telephone. At
A42 1080 one time, while still under the impression that he was dealing with a
A42 1090 Cuban plot, the President talked about invoking a total embargo on
A42 1100 trade with Cuba.   As the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas
A42 1110 sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains, police got close
A42 1120 enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment. From the
A42 1130 luggage, they learned that the two air pirates, far from being Cubans,
A42 1140 were native Americans, subsequently identified as Leon Bearden,
A42 1150 50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge, Ariz&, and his son, Cody,
A42 1160 16, a high-school junior. _TENSION_ The heat and strain began
A42 1170 to tell on the Beardens. The father, by accident or perhaps to show,
A42 1180 as he said, "we mean business", took the .45 and fired a slug
A42 1190 between the legs of Second Officer Norman Simmons. At 7:30 a&m&,
A42 1200 more than three hours after landing, the Beardens gave an ultimatum:
A42 1210    Take off or see the hostages killed.   The tower
A42 1220 cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a&m&, and Captain Rickards
A42 1230 began taxiing toward the runway.   Several police cars, loaded with
A42 1240 armed officers, raced alongside, blazing away at the tires of the
A42 1250 big jet. The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard
A42 1260 engines; the plane slowed to a halt. Ambulances, baggage trucks,
A42 1270 and cars surrounded it.   The day wore on. At 12:50 p&m&
A42 1280 a ramp was rolled up to the plane. A few minutes later, ~FBI agent
A42 1290 Francis Crosby, talking fast, eased up the ramp to the plane, unarmed.
A42 1300 While Crosby distracted the Beardens, stewardesses Carnegey
A42 1310 and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear door. So did hostages Casey,
A42 1320 Cleveland, and Mullen. That left only the four crew members, Crosby,
A42 1330 and Border Patrolman Gilman, all unarmed, with the Beardens.
A42 1340 The elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand, the other in a hip pocket.
A42 1350 Gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance. He caught
A42 1360 officer Simmons' eye, nodded toward young Bearden, and- "I
A42 1370 swung my right as hard as I could. Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy
A42 1380 and it was all over".   Frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48
A42 1390 p&m&, the Beardens were held in bail of $100,000 each on charges
A42 1400 of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines.
A42 1410 (Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to Castro, and live high
A42 1420 in Cuba.) Back home in Coolidge, Ariz&, his 36-year-old wife,
A42 1430 Mary, said: "I thought they were going to Phoenix to look for
A42 1440 jobs". #CONGRESS: MORE MUSCLE# Taking precedence over all other
A42 1450 legislation on
A42 1460 Capitol Hill last week was the military strength of
A42 1470 the nation. The Senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed
A42 1480 speed and unanimity to pass- 85 to 0- the largest peacetime
A42 1490 defense budget in U&S& history.   With the money all
A42 1500 but in hand, however, the Administration indicated that, instead of
A42 1510 the 225,000 more men in uniform that President Kennedy had requested,
A42 1520 the armed forces would be increased by only 160,000. The "hold-back",
A42 1530 as Pentagon mutterers labeled it, apparently was a temporary
A42 1540 expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually
A42 1550 and, thus, the new funds spent prudently.   In all, the Senate
A42 1560 signed a check for $46.7 billion, which not only included the extra
A42 1570 $3.5 billion requested the week before by President Kennedy, but
A42 1580 tacked on $754 million more than the President had asked for. (The
A42 1590 Senate, on its own, decided to provide additional ~B-52 and other
A42 1600 long-range bombers for the Strategic Air Command.) The House, which
A42 1610 had passed its smaller appropriation before the President's urgent
A42 1620 call for more, was expected to go along with the increased defense
A42 1630 budget in short order.   In other areas, Congressional action last
A42 1640 week included:   @ The Senate (by voice vote) and the House
A42 1650 (by 224-170) passed and sent to the White House the compromise
A42 1660 farm bill which the President is expected to sign, not too unhappily.
A42 1670    @ The Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance the government's
A42 1680 health, welfare, and labor activities.   Debate on the
A42 1690 all-important foreign-aid
A42 1700 bill, with its controversial long-range proposals,
A42 1710 had just begun on the Senate floor at the weekend. White House
A42 1720 legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact.
A42 1730 #FOOD: STEW A LA MULLIGATAWNY# Most members of the U&S& Senate,
A42 1740 because they are human, like to eat as high on the hog as they
A42 1750 can. But, because they are politicians, they like to talk as poor-mouth
A42 1760 as the lowliest voter. As a result, ever since 1851 when the Senate
A42 1770 restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol Building, the senators
A42 1780 have never ceased to grumble about the food- even while they
A42 1790 opposed every move that might improve it.   Over the years, enlivened
A42 1800 chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho
A42 1810 potatoes, the menu has pursued its drab all-American course. Individual
A42 1820 senators, with an eye to the voters back home, occasionally introduced
A42 1830 smelts from Michigan, soft-shell crabs from Maryland, oysters
A42 1840 from Washington, grapefruit from Florida. But plain old bean soup,
A42 1850 served daily
A42 1860 since the turn of the century (at the insistence of the
A42 1870 late Sen& Fred Dubois of Idaho), made clear to the citizenry that
A42 1880 the Senate's stomach was in the right place.   In a daring
A42 1890 stroke, the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute
A42 1900 cuisine and hired a $10,000-per-year French-born maitre d'hotel.
A43 0010    {Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly
A43 0020 reports on operation of the turnpikes}.   {Long-term trend
A43 0030 of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward. Higher toll rates
A43 0040 also are helping boost revenues}.   {Result is a better prospect
A43 0050 for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative}.
A43 0060    Things are looking up these days for many of the
A43 0070 State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road
A43 0075 bonds.   traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing.
A43 0080 That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll
A43 0085 gates.   As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes, investors
A43 0090 who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright
A43 0100 speculations are now finding new hope for their investments.
A43 0105    Another
A43 0110 result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these
A43 0120 tax-exempt bonds.   Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local
A43 0130 governments hit a price peak on February 21, according to Standard
A43 0140 + Poor's average. On balance, prices of those bonds have slipped
A43 0150 a bit since then. However, in the same three-month period, toll-road
A43 0160 bonds, as a group, have bucked this trend. On these bonds, price rises
A43 0170 since February 21 easily outnumber price declines. #TAX-FREE RETURNS.#
A43 0180 Investors, however, still see an element of more-than-ordinary
A43 0190 risk in the toll-road bonds. You find the evidence of that in the
A43 0200 chart on this page.   Many of the toll-road bonds still are selling
A43 0210 at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent,
A43 0220 or very close to that. And this is true in the case of some turnpikes
A43 0230 on which revenues have risen close to, or beyond, the point at which
A43 0240 the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on
A43 0250 the bonds.   That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be
A43 0260 had on good corporation bonds. It's not much more, in fact, than
A43 0270 the return that is offered on U& S& Treasury bonds.   For
A43 0280 investors whose income is taxed at high rates, though, a tax-free yield
A43 0290 of 4 per cent is high. It is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried
A43 0300 investor with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed, or for
A43 0310 a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed income. #SWELLING
A43 0320 TRAFFIC.# A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the
A43 0330 most recent 12-month period- ending in February or March- shows
A43 0340 what is happening. The report is based on a survey by Blyth + Company,
A43 0350 investment bankers.   Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in
A43 0360 net revenues during the period.   And there is the bright note:
A43 0370 The gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late
A43 0380 in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession. Many
A43 0390 of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter.   Indication:
A43 0400 The long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward.   Look,
A43 0410 for example, at the Ohio Turnpike. Traffic on that road slumped
A43 0420 sharply in January and February, as compared with those same months
A43 0430 in 1960. Then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues-
A43 0440 after operating costs.   As a result, the road's net revenues
A43 0450 in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest
A43 0460 payments on the turnpike bonds. That was up from 173 per cent
A43 0470 in the preceding 12 months.   That same pattern of earnings shows
A43 0480 up on the Massachusetts Turnpike. Operating revenues were off in
A43 0490 the first three months of 1961, but up for the 12 months ending in March.
A43 0500 Costs were held down, despite a bitter winter.   For the
A43 0510 year, the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs, against 121
A43 0520 per cent in the preceding period. The road's engineers look for further
A43 0530 improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston. #SLOW SUCCESSES.#
A43 0540 Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough
A43 0550 to prove what they can do. The 187-mile Illinois State Toll
A43 0555 Highway,
A43 0560 for example, was not opened over its entire length until December, 1958.
A43 0570 In the 12 months ended in February, 1960, the highway earned enough
A43 0580 to cover 64 per cent of its interest load- with the remainder paid
A43 0590 out of initial reserves. In the 12 months ended in February, 1961,
A43 0600 this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest.   That improvement
A43 0610 is continuing. In the first two months of 1961, earnings of the
A43 0620 Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent
A43 0630 from early 1960.   Success, for many turnpikes, has come hard.
A43 0640 Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates.
A43 0650 In these cases, the turnpike managements have had to turn to
A43 0660 toll-rate increases, or to costly improvements such as extensions or
A43 0665 better
A43 0670 connections with other highways.   Many rate increases already
A43 0680 have been put into effect. Higher tolls are planned for July 1,
A43 0690 1961, on the Richmond-Petersburg, Va&, Turnpike, and proposals for
A43 0700 increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study. #EASIER
A43 0710 ACCESS.# Progress is being made, too, in improving motorists' access
A43 0720 to many turnpikes. The Kansas Turnpike offers an illustration.
A43 0730 Net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements
A43 0740 in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb& 28,
A43 0750 1961.   Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike
A43 0760 are expected late in 1961, with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita,
A43 0770 and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in
A43 0780 both Kansas City, Kans&, and Kansas City, Mo&. Meanwhile, there
A43 0790 appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover
A43 0800 the interest deficiency for eight more years. #FOR SOME ROADS, TROUBLES.#
A43 0810 Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find
A43 0820 that not all roads are nearing their goals.   Traffic and revenues
A43 0830 on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners
A43 0840 and investors alike. If nothing is done, the prospect is that that
A43 0850 road will be in default of interest in 1962. West Virginia toll bonds
A43 0860 have defaulted in interest for months, and, despite recent improvement
A43 0870 in revenues, holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same.
A43 0880    These, however, are exceptions. The typical picture at this
A43 0890 time is one of steady improvement.   It's going to take time
A43 0900 for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in
A43 0910 full. Already, however, several of the turnpikes are earning enough
A43 0920 to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins. Many others are
A43 0930 attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even
A43 0940 point.
A43 0950 ## @ A top American official, after a look at Europe's
A43 0960 factories, thinks the <U&S& is in a "very serious situation"
A43 0970 competitively.>   <Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges,>
A43 0980 accompanied by a member of our staff, on May 10 toured plants of
A43 0990 two of Italy's biggest companies- <Fiat,> the auto producer,
A43 1000 and <Olivetti,> maker of typewriters and calculating machines.
A43 1010    Our staff man cabled from Turin as follows-   "Follow
A43 1020 Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant, and you learn this:
A43 1030    "One, <modern equipment>- much of it supplied under the
A43 1040 Marshall Plan- enables Fiat to turn out 2,100 cars a day. About
A43 1050 half of these are exported.   "Two, <wage costs> are a fraction
A43 1060 of the U&S& costs. A skilled worker on the assembly line,
A43 1070 for example, earns $37 a week.   "Three, <labor troubles>
A43 1080 are infrequent. Fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more
A43 1100 than six years.   "Said Secretary Hodges: 'It's a tough
A43 1110 combination for the U&S& to face'.   <"Olivetti
A43 1120 had a special interest> for Hodges. Olivetti took over Underwood,
A43 1130 the U&S& typewriter maker, in late 1959. Within a year, without
A43 1140 reducing wages, Underwood's production costs were cut one third,
A43 1150 prices were slashed. The result has been that exports of Underwood
A43 1160 products have doubled.   "The Olivetti plant near Turin has
A43 1170 <modern layout, modern machinery.> The firm is <design-conscious,
A43 1180 sales-conscious, advertising-conscious.>   "Hodges is
A43 1190 trying
A43 1200 to get more foreign business to go to the U&S&. The inflow
A43 1210 of foreign capital would help the U&S& balance of payments.
A43 1220    "Hodges predicted: 'I think we will see more foreign firms
A43 1230 coming to the U&S&.
A43 1240 There are many places where we can use their
A43 1250 vigor and new ideas'". ## @ <Foreign competition> has
A43 1260 become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new
A43 1270 ways of handling competitive imports.   The recently unveiled
A43 1280 <Kennedy moves to control the international textile market> can be
A43 1290 significant for American businessmen in many lines.   <Important
A43 1300 aspects> of the Kennedy textile plans are these:   <An
A43 1310 international conference> of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting
A43 1320 countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy.
A43 1330    <Chief aims of the proposed conference> are worth noting.
A43 1340    The U&S& will try to get agreement among the industrialized
A43 1350 countries to <take more textile imports> from the less-developed
A43 1360 countries over the years.   <Point is> that developing countries
A43 1370 often build up a textile industry first, need encouragement to
A43 1380 get on their feet. If they have trouble exporting, international bill
A43 1390 for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would.   <Idea
A43 1400 is> to let these countries earn their way as much as possible.
A43 1410 ## @ At the same time, <another purpose> of the conference
A43 1420 will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports-
A43 1430 especially dumping of specific products- to high-wage textile-producing
A43 1440 countries.   <Japan,> since 1957, has been "voluntarily"
A43 1450 curbing exports of textiles to the U&S&. <Hong Kong,
A43 1460 India and Pakistan> have been limiting exports of certain types
A43 1470 of textiles to Britain for several years under the "Lancashire Pact".
A43 1480    None of these countries is happy with these arrangements.
A43 1490    <The Japanese want to increase exports to the U&S&>
A43 1500 While they have been curbing shipments, they have watched Hong Kong
A43 1510 step in and capture an expanding share of the big U&S& market.
A43 1520    <Hong Kong interests> loudly protest limiting their exports
A43 1530 to Britain, while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into
A43 1540 British market unrestrictedly.   <The Indians and Pakistanis>
A43 1550 are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for
A43 1560 similar reasons.   <The Kennedy hope> is that, at the conference
A43 1570 or through bilateral talks, the low-wage textile-producing countries
A43 1580 in Asia and Europe will see that "dumping" practices cause
A43 1590 friction all around and may result in import quotas.   <Gradual,
A43 1600 controlled expansion> of the world's textile trade is what President
A43 1610 Kennedy wants. This may point the way toward international stabilization
A43 1620 agreements in other products. <It's an important clue
A43 1630 to Washington thinking.> ## @ Note, too, that the Kennedy
A43 1640 textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U&S&
A43 1650 textile industry.   <"Get competitive or get out".> In
A43 1660 veiled terms, that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to
A43 1670 the American textile industry. <The Government will help> in
A43 1680 transferring companies and workers into new lines, where modernization
A43 1690 doesn't seem feasible. <Special depreciation> on new textile machinery
A43 1700 may be allowed. <Government research> will look into new
A43 1710 products and methods.   <Import quotas aren't ruled out>
A43 1720 where the national interest is involved.   But the Kennedy Administration
A43 1730 <doesn't favor> import quotas. Rather, they are impressed
A43 1740 with the British Government's success in forcing- and helping-
A43 1750 the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to
A43 1760 other products.   What's happening in textiles can be <handwriting
A43 1770 on the wall> for other lines having difficulty competing with
A43 1780 imports from low-wage countries. ## @ Among the highest-paid workers
A43 1790 in the world are U&S& coal miners. Yet U&S& coal is
A43 1800 cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water.   <Steel
A43 1810 Company of Wales,> a British steelmaker, wants to bring in
A43 1820 Virginia coal, cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be
A43 1830 able to compete more effectively- especially in foreign markets.
A43 1840    <Virginia coal,> delivered by ship in Wales, will be about
A43 1850 $2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines.
A43 1860    <U&S& coal is cheap,> despite high wages, because
A43 1870 of widespread mechanization of mines, wide coal seams, attactive rates
A43 1880 on ocean freight. Many of the coal seams in the nationalized British
A43 1890 mines are twisting, narrow and very deep.   <Productivity
A43 1900 of U&S& miners> is twice that of the British.   <Welsh
A43 1910 coal miners,> Communist-led, are up in arms at the suggestion that
A43 1920 the steel company bring in American coal. They threaten to strike.
A43 1930    The British Government will have to decide whether to let
A43 1940 U&S& coal in. The British coal industry is unprofitable, has large
A43 1950 coal stocks it can't sell.
A44 0010    EVERY library borrower, or at least those whose taste goes
A44 0020 beyond the five-cent fiction rentals, knows what it is to hear the librarian
A44 0030 say apologetically, "I'm sorry, but we don't have that
A44 0040 book. There wouldn't be much demand for it, I'm afraid".
A44 0050    Behind this reply, and its many variations, is the ever-present budget
A44 0060 problem all libraries must face, from the largest to the smallest.
A44 0070 What to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles?
A44 0080 What to buy for adult and child readers, for lovers of fiction and
A44 0090 nonfiction, for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified, when
A44 0100 your budget is pitifully small? Most library budgets are hopelessly
A44 0110 inadequate. A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually,
A44 0120 which includes the librarian's salary, and not even the New
A44 0130 York Public has enough money to meet its needs- this in the world's
A44 0140 richest city. The plight of a small community library is proportionately
A44 0150 worse.   Confronted with this situation, most libraries
A44 0160 either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they
A44 0170 can with what they have, or else depend on the bounty of patrons and
A44 0180 local governments to supplement their annual funds. In some parts of
A44 0190 the country, however, a co-operative movement has begun to grow, under
A44 0200 the wing of state governments, whereby, with the financial help of the
A44 0210 state, libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional
A44 0220 basis.   New York State has what is probably the most advanced
A44 0230 of these co-operative systems, so well developed that it has become
A44 0240 a model for others to follow. Because it is so large a state, with
A44 0250 marked contrasts in population density, the organization of the New
A44 0260 York co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works. At
A44 0270 one extreme are the systems of upper New York State, where libraries
A44 0280 in two or more counties combine to serve a large, sparsely populated
A44 0290 area. At the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library
A44 0300 System, in a high-density area, with ample resources and a rapidly
A44 0310 growing territory to serve.   Both these types, and those
A44 0320 in between, are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries
A44 0330 that began at Albany as early as 1950, with the creation by the
A44 0340 legislature of county library systems financed by county governments
A44 0350 with matching funds from the state. It was a step in the right direction,
A44 0360 but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully
A44 0370 the thriving systems of today.   Under this law annual grants are
A44 0380 given to systems in substantial amounts. An earlier difficulty was
A44 0390 overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might
A44 0400 join or not, as they saw fit. Some library boards are wary of the
A44 0410 plan. A large, well-stocked library, surrounded in a county by smaller
A44 0420 ones, may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too
A44 0430 great. A small library may cherish its independence and established
A44 0440 ways, and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems
A44 0450 radical to older members of the board.   Within a system, however,
A44 0460 the autonomy of each member library is preserved. The local community
A44 0470 maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library
A44 0480 program, facilities, and services, but wider resources and additional
A44 0490 services become available through membership in a system. All
A44 0500 services are given without cost to members. So obvious are these advantages
A44 0510 that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York State
A44 0520 now has access to a system, and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day,
A44 0530 not too distant, when all the libraries in the state will belong to
A44 0540 a co-op. ## TO SET up a co-operative library system, the law
A44 0550 requires a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes as
A44 0560 the nucleus, and the system is organized around it. The collection may
A44 0570 be in an existing library, or it may be built up in a central collection.
A44 0580 Each system develops differently, according to the area it serves,
A44 0590 but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for
A44 0600 maximum efficiency. The basic state grant is thirty cents for each
A44 0610 person served, and there is a further book incentive grant that provides
A44 0620 an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita, if a library spends
A44 0630 a certain number of dollars.   In Nassau County, for example,
A44 0640 the heavily settled Long Island suburb of New York City, the
A44 0650 system is credited by the state with serving one million persons, a figure
A44 0660 that has doubled since 1950. This system, by virtue of its variety
A44 0670 and size, offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation.
A44 0680    The Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference
A44 0690 service, what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge,
A44 0700 and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area. The
A44 0710 need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual
A44 0720 libraries, adequate to satisfy everyday needs, could afford. Nassau
A44 0730 is currently building a central collection of reference materials
A44 0740 in its Hempstead headquarters, which will reach its goal of 100,000
A44 0750 volumes by 1965.   The major part of this collection is in the
A44 0760 central headquarters building, and the remainder is divided among five
A44 0770 libraries in the system designated as subject centers. Basic
A44 0780 reference
A44 0790 tools are the backbone of the collection, but there is also specialization
A44 0800 in science and technology, an indicated weakness in local libraries.
A44 0810 On microfilm, headquarters also has a file of the <New York
A44 0820 Times> from its founding in 1851 to the present day, as well as bound
A44 0830 volumes of important periodicals. The entire headquarters collection
A44 0840 is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans.
A44 0850    Headquarters gets about 100 requests every day. It is connected
A44 0860 by teletype with the State Library in Albany, which will supply any
A44 0870 book to a system that the system itself cannot provide. The books are
A44 0880 carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other
A44 0890 libraries.   Each subject center library was chosen because
A44 0900 of its demonstrated strength in a particular area, which headquarters
A44 0910 could then build upon. East Meadow has philosophy, psychology, and
A44 0920 religion; Freeport houses social science, pure science, and language;
A44 0930 history, biography, and education are centered in Hempstead; Levittown
A44 0940 has applied science, business, and literature; while Hewlett-Woodmere
A44 0950 is the repository of art, music, and foreign languages.
A44 0960 The reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant,
A44 0970 and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen
A44 0980 local reference service.   This kind of cooperation is not
A44 0990 wholly new, of course. Public libraries in Nassau County have been
A44 1000 lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century, but the system
A44 1010 enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive
A44 1020 basis. Local libraries find, too, that the new plan saves
A44 1030 tax dollars because books can be bought through the system, and since
A44 1040 the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would
A44 1050 be available to an individual library. The system passes on these
A44 1060 savings to its members. Further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping
A44 1070 and clerical detail as the result of central billing.
A44 1080    Books are not the only resource of the system. Schools and community
A44 1090 groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary, art,
A44 1100 and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs,
A44 1110 and to organizations in member communities. The most recent film
A44 1120 catalogue, available at each library, lists 110 titles presently in the
A44 1130 collection, any of which may be borrowed without charge. This catalogue
A44 1140 lists separately films suitable for children, young adults, or adults,
A44 1150 although some classics cut across age groups, such as "Nanook
A44 1160 of the North", "The Emperor's Nightingale", and "The
A44 1170 Red Balloon". Workshops are conducted by the system's audio-visual
A44 1180 consultant for the staffs of member libraries, teaching them the effective
A44 1190 use of film as a library service.   The system well understands
A44 1200 that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children
A44 1210 and books together; consequently an experienced children's librarian
A44 1220 at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned
A44 1230 library activities, cooperating with the children's librarians
A44 1240 in member libraries by means of individual conferences, workshops,
A44 1250 and frequent visits. Headquarters has also set up a central juvenile
A44 1260 book-review and book-selection center, to provide better methods of
A44 1270 purchasing and selection. Sample copies of new books are on display
A44 1280 at headquarters, where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in
A44 1290 workshop groups. Story hours, pre-school programs, activities with
A44 1300 community agencies, and lists of recommended reading are all in the province
A44 1310 of the children's consultant.   Headquarters of the Nassau
A44 1320 system is an increasingly busy place these days, threatening to expand
A44 1330 beyond its boundaries. In addition to the interlibrary loan service
A44 1340 and the children's program, headquarters has a public relations
A44 1350 director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library
A44 1360 service in the county; it prepares cooperative displays (posters,
A44 1370 booklists, brochures, and other promotional material) for use in member
A44 1380 libraries; it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays
A44 1390 already created and used; and it publishes <Sum and Substance>,
A44 1400 a monthly newsletter, which reports the system's activities to
A44 1410 the staffs and trustees of member libraries. The system itself is governed
A44 1420 by a board of trustees, geographically representing its membership.
A44 1430    In Nassau, as in other systems, the long-range objective
A44 1440 is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools, and
A44 1450 on adult education in general. Librarians, a patient breed of men
A44 1460 and women who have borne much with dedication, can begin to see results
A44 1470 today. Library use is multiplying daily, and the bulk of the newcomers
A44 1480 are those maligned Americans, the teen-agers. To them especially
A44 1490 the librarians, with the help of co-ops, hope they will never have to
A44 1500 say, "I'm sorry, we don't have that book".
A44 1510    TODAY, more than ever before, the survival of our free society
A44 1520 depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned. The
A44 1530 great advances made in recent years in Communist strength and in our
A44 1540 own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the Western
A44 1550 world. The need for lifetime reading is apparent. Education must not
A44 1560 be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our
A44 1570 entire lives, for it is only through knowledge that we, as a nation,
A44 1580 can cope with the dangers that threaten our society.   The desire
A44 1590 and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life. We
A44 1600 cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read; if we are not
A44 1610 discriminating in our reading; if we do not know how to use what we
A44 1620 do read. We must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific
A44 1630 age, as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint
A44 1640 that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom
A44 1650 absorbed from the written word.   A fundamental source of knowledge
A44 1660 in the world today is the book found in our libraries. Although
A44 1670 progress has been made in America's system of libraries it still
A44 1680 falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that
A44 1690 are needed for an informed America. The problem grows in intensity
A44 1700 each year as man's knowledge, and his capacity to translate such knowledge
A44 1710 to the written word, continue to expand. The inadequacy of our
A44 1720 library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct
A44 1730 this condition. There are, for example, approximately 25,000,000
A44 1740 people in this country with no public library service and about 50,000,000
A44 1750 with inadequate service. In college libraries, 57 per cent of the
A44 1760 total number of books are owned by 124 of 1,509 institutions surveyed
A44 1770 last year by the U&S& Office of Education. And over 66 per
A44 1780 cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any
A44 1790 library at all. ## IN every aspect of service- to the public,
A44 1800 to children in schools, to colleges and universities- the library
A44 1810 of today is failing to render vitally needed services. Only public
A44 1820 understanding and support can provide that service.   This is
A44 1830 one of the main reasons for National Library Week, April 16-22, and
A44 1840 for its theme: "For a richer, fuller life, read"!
