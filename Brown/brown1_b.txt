B01 0010 #ASSEMBLY SESSION BROUGHT MUCH GOOD# The General Assembly, which
B01 0020 adjourns today, has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle
B01 0030 from the day it convened. It was faced immediately with a showdown
B01 0040 on the schools, an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the
B01 0050 governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education.
B01 0060    There followed the historic appropriations and budget fight, in
B01 0070 which the General Assembly decided to tackle executive powers. The
B01 0080 final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening
B01 0090 budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information
B01 0100 they need.   Long-range planning of programs and ways to finance
B01 0110 them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid
B01 0120 crisis-to-crisis government. This session, for instance, may have
B01 0130 insured
B01 0140 a financial crisis two years from now.   In all the turmoil,
B01 0150 some good legislation was passed. Some other good bills were lost
B01 0160 in the shuffle and await future action. Certainly all can applaud passage
B01 0170 of an auto title law, the school bills, the increase in teacher
B01 0180 pensions, the ban on drag racing, acceptance by the state of responsibility
B01 0190 for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate
B01 0200 as outside city limits, repeal of the college age limit law and the
B01 0210 road maintenance bond issue.   No action has been taken, however,
B01 0220 on such major problems as ending the fee system, penal reform, modification
B01 0230 of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks
B01 0240 sales. Only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal
B01 0250 question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state.
B01 0260    The legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations
B01 0270 questions. Fortunately it spared us from the usual spate
B01 0280 of silly resolutions which in the past have made Georgia look like
B01 0290 anything but "the empire state of the South".   We congratulate
B01 0300 the entire membership on its record of good legislation. In the
B01 0310 interim between now and next year, we trust the House and Senate will
B01 0320 put their minds to studying Georgia's very real economic, fiscal
B01 0330 and social problems and come up with answers without all the political
B01 0340 heroics. @ #LEAGUE REGULARLY STANDS ON THE SIDE OF RIGHT# The
B01 0350 League of Women Voters, 40 now and admitting it proudly, is inviting
B01 0360 financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive. It's a
B01 0370 good use of money.   These women whose organization grew out of
B01 0380 the old suffrage movement are dedicated to Thomas Jefferson's dictum
B01 0390 that one must cherish the people's spirit but "Keep alive their
B01 0400 attention".   "If once they become inattentive to the public
B01 0410 affairs", Jefferson said, "you and I, and Congress and assemblies,
B01 0420 judges and governors, shall all become wolves".   Newspapermen
B01 0430 and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention
B01 0440 and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs. The league
B01 0450 workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and
B01 0460 make them available to the public. The harder the choice, the more willing
B01 0470 the league is to wade in. And the league takes a stand, with great
B01 0480 regularity, on the side of right. @ #LOOK TO COOSA VALLEY FOR
B01 0490 INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS# Cities and counties interested in industrial
B01 0500 development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled
B01 0505 toward the 13 northwest
B01 0510 Georgia counties that are members of the Coosa
B01 0520 Valley Area Planning and Development Commission.   Coupling
B01 0530 its own budget of $83,750 with a $30,000 state grant authorized by
B01 0540 Gov& Vandiver, the group expects to sign a contract in March with
B01 0550 Georgia Tech&. Then a full-time planning office will be established
B01 0560 in Rome to work with a five-member Georgia Tech research staff
B01 0570 for development of an area planning and industrial development program.
B01 0580    The undertaking has abundant promise. It recognizes the fact
B01 0590 that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding
B01 0600 together in an area-wide effort better results can be accomplished than
B01 0610 through the go-it-alone approach. @ #RUSK IDEA STRENGTHENS UNITED
B01 0620 STATES DEFENSE# The Rusk belief in balanced defense, replacing
B01 0630 the
B01 0640 Dulles theory of massive retaliation, removes a grave danger that
B01 0650 has existed.   The danger lay not in believing that our own ~A-bombs
B01 0660 would deter Russia's use of hers; that theory was and is
B01 0670 sound. The danger lay in the American delusion that nuclear deterrence
B01 0680 was enough.   By limiting American strength too much to nuclear
B01 0690 strength, this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war
B01 0700 besides a nuclear war. This strategy heightened the possibility that
B01 0710 we would have a nuclear war.   It also weakened our diplomatic
B01 0720 stance, because Russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear
B01 0730 war except in the ultimate extremity.   This left the Soviets
B01 0740 plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable
B01 0750 impunity.   By maintaining the nuclear deterrent, but gearing
B01 0760 American military forces to fight conventional wars too, Secretary
B01 0770 of State Rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more
B01 0780 muscle and greater safety into our military position. @
B01 0790 #DEKALB BUDGET
B01 0800 SHOWS COUNTY IS ON BEAM# DeKalb's budget for 1961 is a record
B01 0810 one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance.
B01 0820    It includes a raise in the county minimum wage, creation
B01 0830 of several new jobs at the executive level, financing of beefed-up
B01 0840 industrial development efforts, and increased expenditures for essential
B01 0850 services such as health and welfare, fire protection, sanitation and
B01 0860 road maintenance.   That such expansion can be obtained without
B01 0870 a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal
B01 0880 planning on the part of the board of commissioners, headed by Chairman
B01 0890 Charles O& Emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust
B01 0900 he was given was well placed, and other county officials. @ #SOMEWHERE,
B01 0910 SOMEBODY IS BOUND TO LOVE US# G& Mennen Williams is learning
B01 0920 the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly. Touring Africa, the new
B01 0930 U&S& assistant secretary of state observed "Africa should be
B01 0940 for the Africans" and the British promptly denounced him. Then he
B01 0950 arrived in Zanzibar and found Africans carrying signs saying "American
B01 0960 imperialists, go home". Chin up, Soapy. @ #POWER COMPANY
B01 0970 BACKS CONFIDENCE WITH DOLLARS# Confidence in the state's economic
B01 0980 future is reflected in the Georgia Power Company's record construction
B01 0990 budget for this year.   The firm does a large amount of
B01 1000 research and its forecasts have meaning. It is good to know that Georgia
B01 1010 will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet
B01 1020 the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of
B01 1030 industrialization.
B01 1040    Georgia's mental health program received a badly needed boost
B01 1050 from the General Assembly in the form of a $1,750,000 budget increase
B01 1060 for the Milledgeville State Hospital.   Actually it amounts
B01 1070 to $1,250,000 above what the institution already is receiving, considering
B01 1080 the additional half-million dollars Gov& Vandiver allocated
B01 1090 last year from the state surplus.   Either way it sounds like
B01 1100 a sizable hunk of money and is. But exactly how far it will go toward
B01 1110 improving conditions is another question because there is so much that
B01 1120 needs doing.   The practice of charging employes for meals whether
B01 1130 they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished. The work week
B01 1140 of attendants who are on duty 65 hours and more per week should be
B01 1150 reduced.   More attendants, nurses and doctors should be hired.
B01 1160 Patients deserve more attention than they are getting.   Even with
B01 1170 the increase in funds for the next fiscal year, Georgia will be spending
B01 1180 only around $3.15 per day per patient. The national average is
B01 1190 more than $4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental
B01 1200 health field to be too low. Kansas, regarded as tops in the nation in
B01 1210 its treatment of the mentally ill, spends $9 per day per patient.
B01 1220    Georgia has made some reforms, true. The intensive treatment program
B01 1230 is working well. But in so many other areas we still are dragging.
B01 1240    Considering what is being done compared to what needs to be
B01 1250 done, it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning
B01 1260 toward making the best possible use of the increase granted. The
B01 1270 boost is helpful but inadequate.- @
B01 1280 #THE END OF TRUJILLO# Assassination, even of a tyrant, is repulsive
B01 1290 to men of good conscience. Rafael Trujillo, the often-blood thirsty
B01 1300 dictator of the Dominican Republic for 31 years, perhaps deserved
B01 1310 his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history. But whether the murder
B01 1320 of El Benefactor in Ciudad Trujillo means freedom for the people
B01 1330 of the Caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered.
B01 1340    Trujillo knew a great deal about assassination. The responsibility
B01 1350 for scores of deaths, including the abduction and murder of Jesus
B01 1360 Maria Galindez, a professor at Columbia University in New York,
B01 1370 has been laid at his door. He had been involved in countless schemes
B01 1380 to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such
B01 1390 as President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela. It was a sort of poetic
B01 1400 justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow
B01 1410 the Venezuelan government, reportedly involving the use of Dominican
B01 1420 arms by former Venezuelan Dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez, has
B01 1430 been uncovered and quashed.   The recent history of the Dominican
B01 1440 Republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly
B01 1450 benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive. Unquestionably
B01 1460 Trujillo did some good things for his country: he improved
B01 1470 public facilities such as roads and sanitation, attracted industry and
B01 1480 investment and raised the standard of living notably. But the price
B01 1490 was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition.
B01 1500 El Benefactor's vanity grew with his personal wealth. The jails were
B01 1510 filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his
B01 1520 displeasure. He maintained amply financed lobbies in the United States
B01 1530 and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise, and his
B01 1540 influence extended even to Congress.   Until the last year or so
B01 1550 the profession of friendship with the United States had been an article
B01 1560 of faith with Trujillo, and altogether too often this profession
B01 1570 was accepted here as evidence of his good character. Tardily the Government
B01 1580 here
B01 1590 came to understand how this country's own reputation was
B01 1600 tarnished by the association with repression. Last year, after Trujillo
B01 1610 had been cited for numerous aggressions in the Caribbean, the
B01 1620 United States and many other members of the Organization of American
B01 1630 States broke diplomatic relations with him.   Thereupon followed
B01 1640 a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines. Trujillo's
B01 1650 dictatorship had been along conservative, right-wing lines. But
B01 1660 after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing Communist
B01 1670 slogans. There was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with
B01 1680 Castro in Cuba, previously a <bete noire> to Trujillo- thus
B01 1690 illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces.
B01 1700    What comes after Trujillo is now the puzzle. The
B01 1710 Dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little
B01 1720 freedom for a generation, and all alternative leadership has been
B01 1730 suppressed. Perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability, but
B01 1740 the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger. The Dominican
B01 1750 Republic could turn toward Communist-type authoritarianism as easily
B01 1760 as toward Western freedom. Such a twist would be a tragedy for
B01 1770 the Dominican people, who deserve to breathe without fear. For that
B01 1780 reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative
B01 1790 government to the Dominican Republic will need the greatest sympathy
B01 1800 and help. #START ON RAPID TRANSIT# High-speed buses on the George
B01 1810 Washington Memorial Parkway, operating between downtown Washington
B01 1820 and Cabin John, Glen Echo and Brookmont, would constitute
B01 1825 an
B01 1830 alluring sample of what the new National Capital Transportation Agency
B01 1840 can do for this city. In presenting plans for such express buses
B01 1850 before the Montgomery County Council, the administrator of the ~NCTA,
B01 1860 C& Darwin Stolzenbach, was frankly seeking support for
B01 1870 the projects his agency will soon be launching. Such support should
B01 1880 not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the ~NCTA
B01 1890 are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into
B01 1900 the downtown area.   Because the buses would not stop on the
B01 1910 parkway, land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed.
B01 1920 The ~NCTA is well advised to seek funds for this purpose
B01 1930 from the present session of Congress.
B02 0010 #MUST BERLIN REMAIN DIVIDED?# The inference has been too
B02 0015 widely
B02 0020 accepted that because the Communists have succeeded in building barricades
B02 0030 across Berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of
B02 0040 that living city.   So far as the record is concerned, the Western
B02 0050 powers have not acquiesced and should not do so.   Though Walter
B02 0060 Ulbricht, by grace of Soviet tanks, may be head man in East
B02 0070 Germany, that does not give him any right to usurp the government of
B02 0080 East Berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the Soviet zone.
B02 0100    The wartime protocol of September 12, 1944, designated a special "Greater
B02 0110 Berlin" area, comprising the entire city, to be under joint
B02 0120 occupation. It was not a part of any one of the three (later four)
B02 0130 zones for occupation by Soviet, American, British, and French troops
B02 0140 respectively. After the Berlin blockade and airlift, the Council
B02 0150 of Foreign Ministers in 1949 declared a purpose "to mitigate the
B02 0160 effects of the present administrative division of Germany and of Berlin".
B02 0170    For some time the Communists honored the distinction
B02 0180 between the Soviet zone of Germany and the Soviet sector of Berlin
B02 0190 by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas. Then they moved
B02 0200 offices of the East German puppet government into East Berlin
B02 0210 and began illegally to treat it as the capital of East Germany.
B02 0220    That this and the closing of the East Berlin-West Berlin border
B02 0225 have not
B02 0230 been accepted by the Western governments appears in notes which
B02 0235 Britain,
B02 0240 France, and the United States sent to Moscow after the latter's
B02 0250 gratuitous protest over a visit of Chancellor Adenauer and other
B02 0260 West German officials to West Berlin. The Chancellor had as
B02 0270 much business there as Ulbricht had in East Berlin- and was certainly
B02 0280 less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of Gerhard
B02 0290 Eisler.   The British and other replies to that Moscow note
B02 0300 pointed out efforts of the Communist authorities "to integrate East
B02 0310 Berlin into East Germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting
B02 0320 to make it the capital of East Germany". They insisted on
B02 0330 the "fundamental fact" that "the whole of Berlin has a quadripartite
B02 0340 status".   This is far from acknowledging or recognizing
B02 0350 those efforts as an accomplished fact. There remains, of course, the
B02 0360 question of what the West can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent
B02 0370 the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts.   One ground
B02 0380 of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over
B02 0390 into West Berlin as Communist "vopos" try to gun down fleeing
B02 0400 unarmed residents. Another remained when an American Army car was
B02 0410 recovered but with a broken glass. The glass may seem trivial but Communist
B02 0420 official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed.
B02 0430    Remembering the step-by-step fate of Danzig and the
B02 0440 West German misgivings about "salami" tactics, it is to be hoped
B02 0445 that
B02 0450 the dispatch of General Clay to West Berlin as President Kennedy's
B02 0460 representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future
B02 0470 indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed. #PRAIRIE
B02 0480 NATIONAL PARK# Thousands of buffalo ("bison" they will
B02 0490 never be to the man on the street) grazing like a mobile brown throw-rug
B02 0500 upon the rolling, dusty-green grassland. A horizon even and seamless,
B02 0510 binding the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth.   That
B02 0520 picture of the American prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of
B02 0530 those who have studied the conquest of the American continent as any
B02 0540 later cinema image of the West made in live-oak canyons near Hollywood.
B02 0550 For it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the
B02 0560 endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of Americans
B02 0570 the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the
B02 0580 Ohio and Mississippi valleys began to fill.   The National
B02 0590 Park Service now proposes to preserve an area in Pottawatomie County,
B02 0600 northeast Kansas, as a "Prairie National Park". There the
B02 0610 buffalo would roam, to be seen as a tapestry, not as moth-eaten zoo
B02 0620 specimens. Wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved.
B02 0630 Grasslands would extend, unfenced, unplowed, unbroken by silo or barn-
B02 0640 as the first settlers saw them.   The Park Service makes
B02 0650 an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new
B02 0655 park.
B02 0660 American history should clinch the case when Congress is asked to
B02 0670 approve. #WHISKY ON THE AIR# A Philadelphia distiller is currently
B02 0680 breaching the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising
B02 0690 on ~TV and radio. Starting with small stations not members of
B02 0700 the National Association of Broadcasters, the firm apparently is seeking
B02 0710 to break down the anti-liquor barriers in major-market stations.
B02 0720    Probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional
B02 0730 action requiring the Federal Communications Commission
B02 0740 to ban such advertising through its licensing power.   The National
B02 0750 Association of Broadcasters code specifically bars hard-liquor
B02 0760 commercials. Past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this
B02 0770 policy. Even the Distilled Spirits Institute has long had a specific
B02 0780 prohibition.   Why, then, with these voluntary barricades and
B02 0790 some state laws barring liquor ads, is it necessary to seek congressional
B02 0800 action? Simply because the subverting action of firms that are
B02 0810 not members of the Distilled Spirits Institute and of radio and ~TV
B02 0820 stations that are not members of the ~NAB tends to spread.
B02 0830    Soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want
B02 0840 to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly
B02 0850 from the efforts of non-code competitors.   Although the
B02 0860 false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly
B02 0870 no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which ~TV
B02 0880 soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied, there is a sad difference
B02 0890 between enticing a viewer into sipping Oopsie-Cola and gulling him
B02 0900 into downing bourbon.   A law is needed. #NEW YORK: DEMOCRATS'
B02 0910 CHOICE# Registered Democrats in New York City this year have
B02 0920 the opportunity to elect their party's candidates for Mayor and
B02 0930 other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization.
B02 0940    In the central contest, that for Mayor, they may have found
B02 0950 some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other.
B02 0960    Mayor Robert F& Wagner must, as his opponents demand, assume
B02 0970 responsibility for his performance in office. While all citizens
B02 0980 share in blame for lax municipal ethics the Wagner regime has seen serious
B02 0990 problems in the schools, law enforcement and fiscal policies. The
B02 1000 Mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record.
B02 1010    State Controller Arthur Levitt, on the other hand, cannot effectively
B02 1020 deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders
B02 1030 who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than
B02 1040 in the city's welfare. They, too, have links with the city's
B02 1050 ills.   Both men are known to be honest and public-spirited. Mayor
B02 1060 Wagner's shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed
B02 1070 than those of Mr& Levitt who left an impression of quiet competence
B02 1080 in his more protected state post.   As Mayor, Mr& Levitt
B02 1090 might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters
B02 1100 would like. His election, on the other hand, would unquestionably
B02 1110 strengthen the "regulars".   Mr& Wagner might or might
B02 1120 not be a "new" Mayor in this third term, now that he is free of
B02 1130 the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls "bosses". These
B02 1140 are, of course, the same people whose support he has only now rejected
B02 1150 to seek the independent vote.   But his reelection would strengthen
B02 1160 the liberal Democrats and the labor unions who back him.
B02 1170    If this choice is less exciting than New York Democrats may wish,
B02 1180 it nevertheless must be made. The vote still gives citizens a voice
B02 1190 in the operation of their government and their party.
B02 1200 #LITTLE WAR, BIG TEST# Both Mr& ~K's have so far continued
B02 1210 to speak softly and carry big sticks over Laos.   President
B02 1220 Kennedy, already two quiet demands down, still refused Thursday to
B02 1230 be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to Moscow. But at the same
B02 1240 time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the
B02 1250 fighting. And Secretary Rusk, en route to Bangkok, doubtless is
B02 1260 trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of Australian
B02 1270 or Thai ~SEATO forces.   For Mr& Kennedy, speaking
B02 1280 softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad
B02 1290 situation. The new President is in no position to start out his dealings
B02 1300 with Moscow by issuing callable bluffs. He must show at the outset
B02 1310 that he means exactly what he says.   In this case he has put
B02 1320 the alternatives clearly to Mr& Khrushchev for the third time. At
B02 1330 his press conference Mr& Kennedy said, "All we want in Laos
B02 1340 is peace not war **h a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn".
B02 1350 At the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in
B02 1360 unprovocative but ready position.   Since Laos is of no more purely
B02 1370 military value to Moscow itself than it is to Washington, this
B02 1380 approach might be expected to head off Mr& Khrushchev for the moment.
B02 1390 But because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in
B02 1400 Laos, the Soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride- a course
B02 1410 that would appear to cost him little on the spot, but would bog Washington
B02 1420 in a tactical mess.   As wars go, Laos is an extremely
B02 1430 little one. Casualties have been running about a dozen men a day. The
B02 1440 hard core of the pro-Communist rebel force numbers only some 2,000
B02 1450 tough Viet Minh guerrilla fighters. But for the United States and
B02 1460 its ~SEATO allies to attempt to shore up a less tough, less combat-tested
B02 1470 government army in monsoon-shrouded, road-shy, guerrilla-th'-wisp
B02 1480 terrain is a risk not savored by Pentagon planners.
B02 1490 But if anything can bring home to Mr& Khrushchev the idea that he
B02 1500 will not really get much enjoyment from watching this
B02 1505 Braddock-against-the-Indians
B02 1510 contest, it will probably be the fact that ~SEATO
B02 1520 forces are ready to attempt it- plus the fact that Moscow has something
B02 1530 to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations
B02 1540 with Washington.   Fortunately both the Republicans and America's
B02 1550 chief Western allies now are joined behind the neutral Laos
B02 1560 aim of the President. Actually it would be more accurate to say that
B02 1570 the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the British
B02 1580 policy of seeking to achieve a neutral Laos via the international bargaining
B02 1590 table.   It is ironic that Washington is having to struggle
B02 1600 so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable.
B02 1610 The State Department tacitly rejected the neutral Laos idea after
B02 1620 the Geneva conference of 1954, and last year Washington backed the
B02 1630 rightist coup that ousted neutral Premier Souvanna Phouma.   But
B02 1640 since last fall the United States has been moving toward a pro-neutralist
B02 1650 position and now is ready to back the British plan for a cease-fire
B02 1660 patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of
B02 1670 interested powers.   The road to a guaranteed-neutral, coup-proof
B02 1680 Laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation's terrain.
B02 1690 But for the safety of Southeast Asia, and for the sake of the
B02 1700 Laotian people- who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority
B02 1710 now engaged in the fighting- this last big effort to seal that
B02 1720 country from the cold war had to be made. The world awaits Mr& Khrushchev's
B02 1730 choice of alternatives. #A VOTE FOR EDUCATIONAL ~TV#
B02 1740 The Senate's overwhelming (64-13) vote to support locally controlled
B02 1750 educational ~TV efforts should be emulated in the lower
B02 1760 house.   Twice previously the Senate has approved measures backing
B02 1770 ~ETV and the House has let them die. But this year prospects
B02 1780 may be better. The House communications subcommittee is expected to
B02 1790 report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds.
B02 1800    This year's Senate measure would provide each state and the
B02 1810 District of Columbia with $1,000,000 to be used in support of private,
B02 1820 state, or municipal ~ETV efforts. The funds would be used
B02 1830 for equipment, not for land, buildings, or operation.   The relatively
B02 1840 few communities that have educational stations have found them
B02 1850 of considerable value. But, lacking money from commercial sponsors, the
B02 1855 stations have had
B02 1860 difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service.
B02 1870 Other communities- the ones to be aided most by the Senate bill-
B02 1880 have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial
B02 1890 cost of equipment.
B03 0010 #A GOOD MAN DEPARTS GOODBY, MR& SAM# Sam Rayburn was a good man,
B03 0020 a good American, and, third, a good Democrat.   He was all
B03 0030 of these rolled into one sturdy figure; Mr& Speaker, Mr& Sam,
B03 0040 and Mr& Democrat, at one and the same time.   The House was
B03 0050 his habitat and there he flourished, first as a young representative,
B03 0060 then as a forceful committee chairman, and finally in the post for which
B03 0070 he seemed intended from birth, Speaker of the House, and second
B03 0080 most powerful man in Washington.   Mr& Rayburn was not an easy
B03 0090 man to classify or to label. He was no flaming liberal, yet the New
B03 0100 Deal, the Fair Deal and the New Frontier needed him. He was
B03 0110 not a rear-looking conservative, yet partisans of that persuasion will
B03 0120 miss him as much as any.   Two of the vital qualities demanded
B03 0130 of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence
B03 0140 and that he keep his word. Sam Rayburn took unnumbered secrets with
B03 0150 him to the grave, for he was never loquacious, and his word, once
B03 0160 given, was not subject to retraction. It might be added that as he kept
B03 0170 his word so he expected that others keep theirs.   The demonstration
B03 0180 of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical. His leadership
B03 0190 was not for audiences. A growl, a nod, was usually enough. When it
B03 0200 was not, one of the great dramas of Washington would be presented.
B03 0210 He would rise in the well of the House, his chin upon his chest, his
B03 0220 hands gripping the side of a desk, and the political and legislative
B03 0230 chatter would subside into silence.   He spoke briefly, sensibly,
B03 0240 to the point and without oratorical flourishes He made good, plain
B03 0250 American common sense and the House usually recognized it and acted
B03 0260 upon it.   These public efforts were rare because Mr& Rayburn
B03 0270 normally did his counseling, persuading and educating long before
B03 0280 an issue reached its test on the House floor. He expected Democrats
B03 0290 to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them. With
B03 0300 his long service he had a long memory, an excellent thing in a political
B03 0310 leader.   {He was, of course, in the House for a very long
B03 0320 time. There are only two men remaining in Congress who, with Rayburn,
B03 0330 voted for the declaration of war against Germany in 1917. To
B03 0340 almost two generations of Americans it must have seemed as though the
B03 0350 existence of Mr& Sam coincided with that of the House}.
B03 0360 And it was the House he loved. To be presiding officer of it was the
B03 0370 end of his desire and ambition. The Senate to him was not the "upper
B03 0380 body" and he corrected those who said he served "under" the
B03 0390 president. He served "with" him.   Sound the roll of those
B03 0400 with whom he served and who preceded him in death. Woodrow Wilson,
B03 0410 with whom he began his years in Washington, Warren G& Harding,
B03 0420 Calvin Coolidge, ~FDR, with whom he managed a social revolution.
B03 0430 And those still with us, Herbert C& Hoover, Harry S& Truman,
B03 0440 Dwight D& Eisenhower and John F& Kennedy.   He was
B03 0450 a fighter for those of his own party. Mr& Truman has only to recall
B03 0460 the "hopeless" campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan
B03 0470 he was and the first experience of Mr& Kennedy with Congress would
B03 0480 have been sadder than it was had not Mr& Sam been there. As it
B03 0490 was, his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration.
B03 0500    With Republican presidents, he fought fair. He was
B03 0510 his own man, not an automatic obstructionist. He kept his attacks
B03 0520 on Republicanism for partisan campaigns, but that is part of the game
B03 0525 he
B03 0530 was born to play.   Under any name- Mr& Speaker, Mr&
B03 0540 Democrat, Mr& Sam- he was a good man. #~UN OFF THE CONGO TRACK#
B03 0550 Thirteen Italian airmen who went to the Congo to serve the
B03 0560 cause of peace under the United Nations banner have instead met violent
B03 0570 death at the hands of Congolese troops supposedly their friends.
B03 0580    In 18 months, no more grisly incident has been reported from that
B03 0590 jungle. Simply out of bloodlust, their murderers dismembered the
B03 0600 bodies and tossed the remains into the river. The excuse was offered
B03 0610 for them that they had mistaken the Italians for Belgian mercenaries.
B03 0620 In other words, atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central
B03 0630 government might be condoned, had the victims been serving the cause
B03 0640 of dissident Katanga.   Does this suggest that the Congo
B03 0650 is fit for nationhood or that ~UN is making any progress whatever
B03 0660 toward its goal of so making it? To the contrary, through the past
B03 0665 six
B03 0670 weeks violence has been piled upon violence. Mass rapes, troop mutinies,
B03 0680 uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures,
B03 0690 given no sanction by any political authority, have become almost
B03 0700 daily occurrences. Yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is
B03 0710 not the work of Katanga. It happens in the territory of the Leopoldville
B03 0720 government, which is itself a fiction, demonstrably incapable
B03 0730 of governing, and commanding only such limited credit abroad as ~UN
B03 0740 support gives it.   The main question raised by the incident is
B03 0750 how much longer will ~UN bury its head in the sand on the Congo
B03 0760 problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in
B03 0770 present terms? The probable answer is that it will do so just as long
B03 0780 as Russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young African
B03 0790 nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting
B03 0800 ruin on Central Africa.   Right now, they are pushing
B03 0810 a resolution which would have ~UN use its forces to invade and subjugate
B03 0820 Katanga. That notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several
B03 0830 points of view. The ~UN army is too weak, too demoralized for
B03 0840 the task. Further, it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it
B03 0850 is now garrisoned. Last, it makes no sense to deliver Katanga, the one
B03 0860 reasonably solid territory, into the existing chaos.   The Congo
B03 0870 should have been mandated, because it was not ready for independence.
B03 0880 The idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed
B03 0890 over wisdom. It is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because
B03 0900 it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism. But if
B03 0910 any realism and feeling for truth remain in the General Assembly, it
B03 0920 is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and
B03 0930 urge some new approach. Otherwise, ~UN will march blindly on to
B03 0940 certain defeat. #FEATHERBED REVERSAL# A recent editorial discussing
B03 0950 a labor-management agreement reached between the Southern Pacific
B03 0960 Co& and the Order of Railroad Telegraphers has been criticized
B03 0970 on the grounds that it was not based on complete information.
B03 0980 The editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that
B03 0990 the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed
B03 1000 40 hours' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction
B03 1010 in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year. Our comment
B03 1020 was that this was "featherbedding" in its ultimate form and that
B03 1030 sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such
B03 1040 an agreement. The statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad
B03 1050 had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers, but
B03 1060 that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life.
B03 1070    Additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad
B03 1080 gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need.
B03 1090 Also, normal personal attrition would make the job reduction provision
B03 1100 more or less academic.   The situation with regard to the Southern
B03 1110 Pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable
B03 1120 to other situations in other industries. The solution reached in
B03 1130 the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally
B03 1140 included in a series of union demands.
B03 1150 #MEDITATIONS FROM A FALLOUT SHELTER# Time was when the house of delegates
B03 1160 of the American Bar association leaned to the common sense
B03 1170 side. But the internationalists have taken over the governing body of
B03 1180 the bar, and when the lads met in St& Louis, it was not to grumble
B03 1190 about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the United Nations
B03 1200 was scarcely less than wonderful, despite an imperfection here and
B03 1210 there.   It was, the brief writers decided, "man's best hope
B03 1220 for a peaceful and law abiding world". Peace, it's wonderful, and
B03 1230 "world law", it's wonderful, too, and shouldn't we get an international
B03 1240 covenant extending it into space, before the Russians put
B03 1250 some claim jumper on the moon?   Meanwhile, in Moscow, Khrushchev
B03 1260 was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build
B03 1270 a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of ~TNT, to knock
B03 1280 sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can't see the justice
B03 1290 of surrendering West Berlin to communism.   A nuclear pacifier
B03 1300 of these dimensions- roughly some six and a half times bigger
B03 1310 than anything the United States has triggered experimentally- would
B03 1320 certainly produce a bigger bang, and, just for kicks, Khrushchev might
B03 1330 use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from St&
B03 1340 Louis to the moon, where there wouldn't even be any beer to drink.
B03 1350    While he was at it, the philosopher of the Kremlin contributed
B03 1360 an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in
B03 1370 the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide.   "Fools",
B03 1380 he bayed, "what do you think you are doing"?   The
B03 1390 only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't
B03 1400 playing the marimba with our shoes in the United Nations, but
B03 1410 perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this
B03 1420 feeble effort.   Another evidence of the spreading rule of reason
B03 1430 was provided from Mexico City with the daily hijacking of an American
B03 1440 plane by a demented Algerian with a gun. The craft made the familiar
B03 1450 unwelcome flight to Havana, where, for some unknown reason, Castro
B03 1460 rushed to the airport to express mortification to the Colombian
B03 1470 foreign minister, a passenger, who is not an admirer of old Ten O'Clock
B03 1480 Shadow. The plane was sent back to the United States, for
B03 1490 a change, but Castro kept the crazy gunman, who will prove a suitable
B03 1500 recruit to the revolution.   Less respect for the legal
B03 1510 conventions was displayed by Castro's right hand man, Che Guevara,
B03 1520 who edified the Inter-American Economic and Social council meeting
B03 1530 in Montevideo by reading two secret American documents purloined
B03 1540 from the United States embassy at Caracas, Venezuela. The contents
B03 1550 were highly embarrassing to American spokesmen, who were on hand
B03 1560 to promise Latin Americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium.
B03 1570    Perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing
B03 1580 American diplomatic papers and planes, but the Kennedy administration
B03 1590 can always file a demurrer to the effect that, but for its own
B03 1600 incompetence in protecting American interests, these things would
B03 1610 not happen. The same can be said about the half-hearted Cuban invasion
B03 1620 mounted by the administration last April, which, we trust, is not
B03 1630 symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious
B03 1640 Khrushchev.   Pass the iron rations, please, and light another
B03 1650 candle, for it's getting dark down here and we're minded to read
B03 1660 a bit of world law just to pass the time away. #THE CUSTOMER LOSES
B03 1670 AGAIN# The board of suspension of the Interstate Commerce commission
B03 1680 has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates
B03 1690 on grain, as they had planned to do this month.   The request for
B03 1700 lower rates originated with the Southern railway, which has spent
B03 1710 a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which
B03 1720 it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional,
B03 1730 smaller car. By reducing rates as much as 60 per cent, it and
B03 1735 its
B03 1740 associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have
B03 1750 lost to truckers and barge lines.   The board's action shows
B03 1760 what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws.
B04 0010 #A SHOCK WAVE FROM AFRICA# WORD OF Dag Hammarskjold's death
B04 0020 in an African plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe.
B04 0030 As head of the United Nations he was the symbol of world peace, and
B04 0040 his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously. It was
B04 0050 on the eve of a momentous U&N& session to come to grips with cold
B04 0060 war issues. His firm hand will be desperately missed.   Mr&
B04 0070 Hammarskjold was in Africa on a mission of peace. He had sought
B04 0080 talks with Moise Tshombe, the secessionist president of Congo's Katanga
B04 0090 province where recent fighting had been bloody. He earnestly
B04 0100 urged a cease-fire.   The story of the fatal crash is not fully
B04 0110 known. The U&N&-chartered plane which was flying from the conference
B04 0120 city of Ndola in Northern Rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun
B04 0130 bullets last weekend and was newly repaired. Whether this, or
B04 0150 overt action, was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined.
B04 0160    The death of Mr& Hammarskjold removes the United Nations'
B04 0170 most controversial leader. He was controversial because he was uncompromising
B04 0180 for peace and freedom with justice. He courageously defended
B04 0190 the rights of small nations, and he stood his ground against the
B04 0200 savage attacks of the Communist bloc.   The Congo, in whose cause
B04 0210 he died, was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs. His policies
B04 0220 had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war
B04 0230 and workable solutions were beginning to take shape. When the recent
B04 0240 Katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions Mr& Hammarskjold, despite
B04 0250 the danger, flew to exert a calming influence. He gave his life
B04 0260 for his beliefs.   The U&N& session scheduled for today
B04 0270 will meet under the cloud of his passing. It is a crucial session with
B04 0280 the world on the edge of momentous developments.   If the manner
B04 0290 of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication
B04 0300 the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason
B04 0310 and justice. That is the hope of mankind. #MONUMENT TO TOGETHERNESS#
B04 0320 REACHING AGREEMENT on projects of value to the whole community
B04 0330 has long been one of Greater Miami's hardest tasks. Too
B04 0340 many have bogged down in bickering. Even when public bodies arrived at
B04 0350 a consensus, at least one dissenting vote has been usual.   So
B04 0360 we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity. All nine members of
B04 0370 the Inter-American Center Authority voted for Goodbody + Company's
B04 0380 proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center.
B04 0390    The widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms
B04 0400 of its contract. If the indenture is accepted, the authority will
B04 0410 proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue. Then Goodbody
B04 0420 will hand over a minimum of $15.5 million for developing the spacious
B04 0430 Graves Tract to house the center.   The next step awaits
B04 0440 approval today by the Metro commissioners as the members of the Dade
B04 0450 County Port Authority. They allotted $500,000 three years ago to
B04 0460 support Interama until its own financing could be arranged. Less than
B04 0470 half the sum has been spent, since the Interama board pinched pennies
B04 0480 during that period of painstaking negotiations. The balance is being
B04 0490 budgeted for the coming year.   Unanimity on Interama is not
B04 0500 surprising. It is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly
B04 0510 everyone is agreed. The City of Miami recently yielded a prior claim
B04 0520 of $8.5 million on the Graves Tract to clear the way for the project.
B04 0530 County officials have cooperated consistently. So have the people's
B04 0540 elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels.   Interama,
B04 0550 as it rises, will be a living monument to Greater Miami's
B04 0555 ability
B04 0560 to get together on worthwhile enterprises. #A SHORT REPORT AND
B04 0570 A GOOD ONE# PROGRESS, or lack of it, toward civil rights in
B04 0580 the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689-page compilation issued
B04 0590 last week by the United States Commission on Civil Rights.
B04 0600    Much happened in this field during the past 12 months. Each state
B04 0610 advisory committee documented its own activity. Some accounts are quite
B04 0620 lengthy but Florida's is the shortest of all, requiring only four
B04 0630 paragraphs.   "The established pattern of relative calm in the
B04 0640 field of race relations has continued in all areas", reported this
B04 0650 group headed by Harold Colee of Jacksonville and including two South
B04 0660 Floridians, William D& Singer and John B& Turner of Miami.
B04 0670    "No complaints or charges have been filed during the past
B04 0680 year, either verbally or written, from any individual or group.
B04 0690    "The committee continues to feel that Florida has progressed
B04 0700 in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in
B04 0710 its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from
B04 0720 time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights".   Problems
B04 0730 have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most
B04 0740 cases with understanding and restraint. The progress reported by the
B04 0750 advisory committee is real. While some think we move too fast and others
B04 0760 too slowly, Florida's record is a good one and stands out among
B04 0770 the 50. #WEST GERMANY REMAINS WESTERN# WEST GERMANY will
B04 0780 face the crucial tests that lie ahead, on Berlin and unification, with
B04 0790 a coalition government. This is the key fact emerging from Sunday's
B04 0800 national election.   Chancellor Adenauer's Christian Democratic
B04 0810 Party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough
B04 0820 to lose the absolute Bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957. In
B04 0830 order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival
B04 0840 parties which gained strength. Inevitably this means some compromise.
B04 0850    The aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired. Both
B04 0860 Willy Brandt's Social Democrats, who gained 22 seats in the
B04 0870 new parliament, and the Free Democrats, who picked up 23, will insist
B04 0880 on that before they enter the government.   Moon-faced Ludwig
B04 0890 Erhart, the economic expert, probably will ascend to the leadership
B04 0900 long denied him.   If he becomes chancellor, Dr& Erhart would
B04 0910 make few changes. The wizard who fashioned West Germany's astonishing
B04 0920 industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise. He is dedicated
B04 0930 to building the nation's strength and, as are all West Germans,
B04 0940 to a free Berlin and to reunion with captive East Germany.
B04 0950    What is in doubt as the free Germans and their allies consider the
B04 0960 voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result.
B04 0970 If the party of Adenauer and Erhart, with 45 per cent of the vote,
B04 0980 approaches the party of Willy Brandt, which won 36 per cent, the result
B04 0990 would be a stiffening of the old resolve. West Berlin's Mayor
B04 1000 Brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his
B04 1010 city and won votes by it.   The Free Democrats (12 per cent
B04 1020 of the vote) believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with
B04 1030 the Soviet Union, and more dealings with the Communist bloc.
B04 1040    The question left by the election is whether West Germany veers slightly
B04 1050 toward more firmness or more flexibility. It could go either
B04 1060 way, since the gains for both points of view were about the same.
B04 1070    Regardless of the decision two facts are clear. West Germany, with
B04 1080 its industrial and military might, reaffirmed its democracy and remains
B04 1090 firm with the free nations. And the career of Konrad Adenauer,
B04 1100 who upheld Germany's tradition of rock-like leaders which
B04 1105 Bismarck
B04 1110 began, draws near the end. #BETTER ASK BEFORE JOINING# AMERICANS
B04 1120 are a nation of joiners, a quality which our friends find endearing
B04 1130 and sometimes amusing. But it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn't
B04 1140 want to make a spectacle of himself.   For instance, so-called
B04 1150 "conservative" organizations, some of them secret, are sprouting
B04 1160 in the garden of joining where "liberal" organizations once took
B04 1170 root.   One specific example is a secret "fraternity" which
B04 1180 will "coordinate anti-Communist efforts". The principle is commendable
B04 1190 but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get
B04 1200 gulled.   According to The Chicago Tribune News Service,
B04 1210 State Atty& Gen& Stanley Mosk of California has devised a series
B04 1220 of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization
B04 1230 seeking his money and his name: _1._ Does it assail schools
B04 1240 and churches with blanket accusations? _2._ Does it attack other
B04 1250 traditional American institutions with unsupportable and wild charges?
B04 1260 _3._ Does it put the label of un-American or subversive on
B04 1270 everyone with whom it disagrees politically? _4._ Does it attempt
B04 1280 to rewrite modern history by blaming American statesmen for wars,
B04 1290 communism, depression, and other troubles of the world? _5._ Does
B04 1300 it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone
B04 1310 calls and letter writing campaigns? _6._ Do its spokesmen
B04 1320 seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the
B04 1330 principles they purport to advocate?   In some instances a seventh
B04 1340 question can be added: _7._ Does the organization show an
B04 1350 affinity for a foreign government, political party or personality in opposition
B04 1360 or preference to the American system?   If the would-be
B04 1370 joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists
B04 1380 who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic
B04 1390 apprehensions of Americans in a troubled time. FALLING somewhere
B04 1400 in a category between Einstein's theory and sand fleas- difficult
B04 1410 to see but undeniably there, nevertheless- is the tropical green
B04 1420 "city" of Islandia, a string of offshore islands that has almost
B04 1430 no residents, limited access and an unlimited future. The latter is
B04 1440 what concerns us all. Whatever land you can see here, from the North
B04 1450 tip end of Elliott Key looking southward, belongs to someone- people
B04 1460 who have title to the land. And what you can't see, the land
B04 1470 underneath the water, belongs to someone, too. The public. The only
B04 1480 real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water
B04 1490 land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater
B04 1500 land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment.
B04 1510 In the fairly brief but hectic history of Florida, the developers
B04 1520 of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours.
B04 1530 In this instance, happily, insistence is being made that our share
B04 1540 is protected. And until this protection is at least as concrete as,
B04 1550 say, the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at Miami Beach,
B04 1560 those who represent us all should agree to nothing.
B04 1570 #CLOSED DOORS IN CITY HALL#
B04 1580 The reaction of certain City Council members to
B04 1590 California's newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing.
B04 1600    We had assumed that at least this local legislative
B04 1610 body had nothing to hide, and, therefore, had no objections to making
B04 1620 the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available
B04 1630 to the public.   In the preamble to the open-meeting statutes,
B04 1640 collectively known as the Brown Act, the Legislature declares that
B04 1650 "the public commissions, boards and councils and other public agencies
B04 1660 in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business.
B04 1670 It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and
B04 1680 that their deliberations be conducted openly.   "The people
B04 1690 of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve
B04 1700 them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public
B04 1710 servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and
B04 1720 what is not good for them to know.   The full implementation of
B04 1730 these noble words, however, has taken the efforts of five sessions of
B04 1740 the Legislature. Since 1953 California has led the nation in enacting
B04 1750 guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted, but not
B04 1760 until this year did the lawmakers in Sacramento plug the remaining
B04 1770 loopholes in the Brown Act.   Despite the lip service paid by
B04 1780 local governments, the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted
B04 1790 by reservations and rationalizations. When all else fails, it
B04 1800 is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations.
B04 1810    We submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law- and one
B04 1820 of its principal aims. Without public scrutiny the deliberations
B04 1830 of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily. But the
B04 1840 citizens would, of course, never be sure that the decisions that resulted
B04 1850 were as correct as they were expeditious.
B05 0010 #HELP WHEN NEEDED# @ IF THE Dominican Republic achieves
B05 0020 free, democratic government, it will be due in large part to the U&S&
B05 0030 show of force that enabled President Balaguer to prevent a threatened
B05 0040 restoration of Trujillo dictatorship.   Outwardly, Ciudad
B05 0050 Trujillo is calm. None of the Trujillo family remains. Mr&
B05 0060 Balaguer is in control, and opposition leaders have no further excuse
B05 0070 to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections
B05 0080 in the spring.   Had U&S& warships not appeared off
B05 0090 the Dominican coast, there is every possibility that the country would
B05 0100 now be wracked by civil war. Ultimately either the Trujillos would
B05 0110 have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions
B05 0120 favorable to a takeover by Dominican elements responsive to Castro
B05 0130 in Cuba.   Within the Organization of American States,
B05 0140 there may be some criticism of this unilateral American intervention
B05 0150 which was not without risk obviously. But there was no complaint from
B05 0160 the Dominican crowds which lined Ciudad Trujillo's waterfront
B05 0170 shouting, "Vive Yankees"! More, the U&S& action was hailed
B05 0180 by a principal opposition leader, Dr& Juan Bosch, as having saved
B05 0190 "many lives and many troubles in the near future".   Mr&
B05 0200 Balaguer's troubles are by no means over. He will need the help
B05 0210 of all ~OAS members to eradicate, finally, the forces of authoritarianism,
B05 0220 pro-Trujillo and pro-Castro alike. In cooperating toward
B05 0230 that objective, ~OAS might move with the speed and effectiveness
B05 0240 demonstrated by the United States. @ #MATTER OF SURVIVAL# @
B05 0250 THOSE watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial
B05 0260 unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor
B05 0270 split in 1935.   Now, as then, it is a matter of jobs. Craft
B05 0280 unions seek work that industrial unions claim, such as factory maintenance.
B05 0290    The issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession
B05 0300 from the American Federation of Labor of its industrial union
B05 0310 members. That breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the American
B05 0320 Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations.
B05 0330 Or that's what it looked like at the time.   But automation
B05 0340 and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition
B05 0350 for jobs. Walter Reuther, leader of the industrial union faction
B05 0360 of the ~AFL-~CIO, says another two years of this squabbling
B05 0370 will be disastrous for all American labor.   Whether it could
B05 0380 be as disastrous for American labor as, say, Jimmy Hoffa of the
B05 0390 Teamsters, is a matter of conjecture. But the jurisdictional disputes
B05 0400 that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for
B05 0410 labor.   Engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition
B05 0420 of national survival, this country can have little patience with
B05 0430 labor's family feuds. The concept of labor as a special class is
B05 0440 outmoded, and in the task confronting America as bastion of the free
B05 0450 world, labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself
B05 0460 to survive. @ #DETERRENT# @ THE Army, Navy and Air
B05 0470 Force, among others, may question Secretary Freeman's claim that
B05 0480 the high estate of United States agriculture is the "strongest
B05 0490 deterrent" to the spread of communism. But the secretary insists that
B05 0500 the success of the American farmer is the "greatest single source
B05 0510 of strength" in the struggle to insure freedom around the world.
B05 0520    Mr& Freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on
B05 0530 a recent world trade trip people were more awed by America's capacity
B05 0540 to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production- or
B05 0550 even by the Soviet's successes in space. This shouldn't surprise
B05 0560 the secretary; American taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses
B05 0570 for a long, long time.   In fact, over the years, the American
B05 0580 farmer's capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large
B05 0590 dollar. And thus far, Mr& Freeman has offered very little relief.
B05 0600    The 1961 feed grain program, which the secretary sponsored,
B05 0610 has been declared a billion dollar fiasco. In exchange for higher price
B05 0620 supports, growers pledged reduction in planted acreage. But the
B05 0630 farmers outsmarted Washington by shortening the distance between the
B05 0640 rows and pouring on the fertilizer.   The result: $1.1 billion
B05 0650 added to the deficit in the federal budget. Perhaps, as Mr& Freeman
B05 0660 says, American agriculture may stop the Communists, but it is also
B05 0670 swindling the American taxpayer. @ #WHAT'S WRONG AT STATE#
B05 0680 @ A SENATE subcommittee headed by Sen& Jackson of Washington
B05 0690 has been going over the State Department and has reached some
B05 0700 predictable conclusions. The department needs a clearer "sense of
B05 0710 direction" at the top and it needs fewer, but better, people, Sen&
B05 0720 Jackson says.   The subcommittee is not alone in questioning
B05 0730 the effectiveness of the department. President Kennedy has indicated
B05 0740 his dissatisfaction with its performance.   But those who would
B05 0750 revitalize so complex an organization must, first of all, overcome the
B05 0760 resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures,
B05 0770 suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes.   Nor does Sen&
B05 0780 Jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in
B05 0790 the White House of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the
B05 0800 study of foreign policy. This tends to create friction and confusion
B05 0810 and has not made it easier for Secretary Rusk to restore vigor and
B05 0820 initiative among his subordinates.   But competent observers believe
B05 0830 he is making progress, particularly toward what Sen& Jackson
B05 0840 lists as the primary need- "a clearer understanding of where our
B05 0850 vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them".
B05 0860    The Jackson report will provide some of the political support
B05 0870 Mr& Rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel
B05 0880 engaged, as Sen& Jackson puts it, "in work that does not really
B05 0890 need doing". Mr& Rusk should also draw comfort from Sen& Jackson's
B05 0900 recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national
B05 0910 security problems be improved. Self-criticism is a rare but needed
B05 0920 commodity in Congress. @ #BETTING MEN# @ FORECASTING
B05 0930 economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist.
B05 0940 But now apparently the job of Secretary of Labor requires that he
B05 0950 be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment
B05 0960 trends.   James P& Mitchell, when he was the head of the department,
B05 0970 promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn't drop below
B05 0980 three million a couple of years ago. He lost, but settled for a cake
B05 0990 in the shape of a fedora.   His successor, Secretary Goldberg,
B05 1000 also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which
B05 1010 has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months. No
B05 1020 betting man, Mr& Goldberg says he's merely "putting my neck out
B05 1030 again" by predicting the rate will go down this month. He is basing
B05 1040 his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened
B05 1050 its stride- a new record high in personal income, an increase
B05 1060 in housing starts, a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for
B05 1070 durable goods.   Mr& Mitchell had an excuse for losing- the
B05 1080 steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated. Mr& Goldberg
B05 1090 has less reason for missing. The economy seems to be sailing along on
B05 1100 an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an
B05 1110 end so they can't be blamed in November. The odds thus appear favorable
B05 1120 that the secretary's neck may be spared. @ #LITTLE RESISTANCE#
B05 1130 @ CAMBODIA'S chief of state, who has been accused of
B05 1140 harboring Communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for
B05 1150 neighboring South Viet Nam and Thailand, insists he would be very
B05 1160 unhappy if communism established its power in Southeast Asia.
B05 1170    But so convinced of communism's inevitable triumph is Prince
B05 1180 Sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel. "I have to see the
B05 1190 facts", is the way the prince puts it. And from that point of vantage
B05 1200 he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-Western
B05 1210 posture.   Prince Sihanouk's powers of prognostication
B05 1220 some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the
B05 1230 courage of his convictions.
B05 1240 #BOTTOM SIGHTED# @ COMMERCE Secretary Hodges seems to have
B05 1250 been cast in the role of pacemaker for official Washington's economic
B05 1260 forecasters. Weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second
B05 1270 quarter of this year while his colleagues in the Cabinet were shaking
B05 1280 their heads in disagreement. Recently Treasury Secretary Dillon and
B05 1290 Labor Secretary Goldberg fell into line with Mr& Hodges' appraisal,
B05 1300 though there has been some reluctance to do so at the White
B05 1310 House.   And now Mr& Hodges has pioneered further into the
B05 1320 economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped
B05 1330 sliding and that it should start going upward from this point. He
B05 1340 is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump.
B05 1350    The secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail
B05 1360 sales. February's volume was 1 per cent above January's for the
B05 1370 first pickup since last October, although it's still 1.5 per cent
B05 1380 off from February 1960.   Corroborating Mr& Hodges' figures
B05 1390 was the Federal Reserve Board's report of the large sales increase
B05 1400 in the nation's department stores for the week ending March 4.
B05 1410 In Newark, for example, this gain was put at 26 per cent above the
B05 1420 year-earlier level. Of course, some of the credit for the sale boost
B05 1430 must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that Easter
B05 1440 comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960.   Another optimistic
B05 1450 sign, this one from the Labor Department, was the report that
B05 1460 the long rise in unemployment compensation payments "was interrupted
B05 1470 for the first time in the week ending Feb& 25". Initial claims
B05 1480 for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8,100 in the week
B05 1490 ending March 4.   Mr& Hodges is so hopeful over the outlook
B05 1500 that he doesn't think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes.
B05 1510 Well, we can't have everything. Prosperity for the whole nation
B05 1520 is certainly preferred to a tax cut. @ #IN NEW JERSEY, TOO#
B05 1530 @ NEW JERSEY folk need not be told of the builder's march to
B05 1540 the sea, for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles
B05 1550 of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that
B05 1560 remain. Now the Stone Harbor bird sanctuary, 31 acres of magic attraction
B05 1570 for exotic herons, is threatened, but the battlefront extends
B05 1580 far beyond our state.   Against the dramatic fight being waged
B05 1590 for preservation of 30 miles of Cape Cod shoreline, the tiny tract
B05 1600 at Stone Harbor may seem unimportant. But Interior Secretary Udall
B05 1610 warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few
B05 1620 surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment
B05 1630 of all as public preserves.   The move for establishment
B05 1640 of a national seashore park on 30,000 acres of Cape Cod, from Provincetown
B05 1650 to Chatham, is strengthened by President Kennedy's interest
B05 1660 in that area. But preservation of the natural beauty of the Cape
B05 1670 is of more than regional concern, for the automobile age has made it the
B05 1680 recreation spot of people from all over the country.   By comparison,
B05 1690 Stone Harbor bird sanctuary's allies seem less formidable,
B05 1700 for aside from the Audubon Society, they are mostly the snowy,
B05 1710 common and cattle egrets and the Louisiana, green, little blue and
B05 1720 black-crowned herons who nest and feed there. But there is hope, for
B05 1730 Conservation Commissioner Bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the
B05 1740 kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its
B05 1750 park space.   The desirability of preserving such places as the
B05 1760 Cape dunes and Stone Harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every
B05 1770 year. Public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is
B05 1780 growing. But that heritage is shrinking even faster. @ #NO JOYRIDE#
B05 1790 @ MUCH of the glamor President Kennedy's Peace Corps
B05 1800 may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by Sargent
B05 1810 Shriver, the head corpsman. Anybody who is expecting a joyride
B05 1820 should, according to Mr& Shriver, get off the train right now.
B05 1830    First of all, the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling.
B05 1840 It will be a 16-hour training day. Then off to a remote place in
B05 1850 an underdeveloped country where the diet, culture, language and living
B05 1860 conditions will be different. And the pay, of course, will be nil.
B05 1870    Despite all this, the idea apparently has captured the imagination
B05 1880 of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by
B05 1890 the response than anybody else.
B06 0010    The study of the St& Louis area's economic prospects prepared
B06 0020 for the Construction Industry Joint Conference confirms and
B06 0030 reinforces both the findings of the Metropolitan St& Louis Survey
B06 0040 of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the Missouri-Illinois
B06 0050 countryside.   St& Louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing
B06 0060 and in some places stagnant mid-continent region. Slackened
B06 0070 regional demand for St& Louis goods and services reflects the region's
B06 0080 relative lack of purchasing power. Not all St& Louis industries,
B06 0090 of course, have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood.
B06 0100 But for those which do, the slow growth of the area has a retarding
B06 0110 effect on the metropolitan core. The city has a stake in stimulating
B06 0120 growth and purchasing power throughout outstate Missouri and Southern
B06 0130 Illinois.   Gov& Dalton's new Commerce and Industry
B06 0140 Commission is moving to create a nine-state regional group in a collective
B06 0150 effort to attract new industry. That is one approach. Another
B06 0160 would be to take the advice of Dr& Elmer Ellis, president of
B06 0170 the University of Missouri, and provide for an impartial professional
B06 0180 analysis of Missouri's economy. He says the state, in order to
B06 0190 proceed with economic development, must develop an understanding of how
B06 0200 the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the
B06 0210 national economy. @   The research center of the University's
B06 0220 School of Business and Public Administration is prepared to undertake
B06 0230 the analysis Dr& Ellis has been talking about. He and Dean
B06 0240 John W& Schwada of the Business School outlined the project at
B06 0250 a recent conference. The University can make a valuable contribution
B06 0260 to the state's economic development through such a study.
B06 0270 In Southern Illinois, the new federal program of help to economically
B06 0280 depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth. The Carbondale
B06 0290 Industrial Development Corp& has obtained a $500,000 loan
B06 0300 to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate
B06 0310 production that will provide 500 new jobs. Carbondale is in the
B06 0315 Herrin-Murphysboro-West
B06 0320 Frankfort labor market, where unemployment
B06 0330 has been substantially higher than the national average. The Federal
B06 0340 program eventually should have a favorable impact on Missouri's depressed
B06 0350 areas, and in the long run that will benefit St& Louis as
B06 0355 well. @
B06 0360    Politics-ridden St& Clair county in Illinois presents
B06 0370 another piece of the problem of metropolitan development. More industrial
B06 0380 acreage lies vacant in St& Clair county than in any other
B06 0390 jurisdiction in the St& Louis area. The unstable political situation
B06 0400 there represents one reason new plants shy away from the East Side.
B06 0410    And then there is St& Louis county, where the Democratic
B06 0420 leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning,
B06 0430 of the important relationship between proper land use and economic
B06 0440 growth. St& Louis county under its present leadership also has
B06 0450 largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform, and permitted
B06 0460 parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests. Some
B06 0470 plant-location specialists take these signs to mean St& Louis
B06 0480 county doesn't want industry, and so they avoid the area, and more
B06 0490 jobs are lost.   Metropolitan St& Louis's relatively slow
B06 0500 rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political, business,
B06 0510 civic and other leaders on both sides of the Mississippi. Without
B06 0520 a great acceleration in the metropolitan area's economy, there will
B06 0530 not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters, and St&
B06 0540 Louis will slip into second-class status. #AN EXCESS OF ZEAL#
B06 0550 Many of our very best friends are reformers. Still we must confess
B06 0560 that sometimes some of them go too far. Take, for example, the reformers
B06 0570 among New York City's Democrats. Having whipped Mr& De
B06 0580 Sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of Tammany Hall,
B06 0590 they have changed the name to Chatham Hall. Even though headquarters
B06 0600 actually have been moved into the Chatham building, do they believe
B06 0610 that they can make the new name stick?   Granted that the Tammany
B06 0620 name and the Tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political
B06 0630 shame, the sachems of the Hall also have a few good marks to
B06 0640 their credit. But it is tradition rather than the record which balks
B06 0650 at the expunging of the Tammany name. After all, it goes back to the
B06 0660 days in which sedition was not un-American, the days in which the Sons
B06 0670 of St& Tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force
B06 0680 and violence- the British government that is.   Further, do
B06 0690 our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent
B06 0700 to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo? They will- when they
B06 0710 give up the donkey and the elephant. Instead of attempting the impossible,
B06 0720 why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger's
B06 0730 stripes are not black? That might go over. #THE FAGET CASE# The
B06 0740 White House itself has taken steps to remove a former Batista official,
B06 0745 Col& Mariano Faget,
B06 0750 from his preposterous position as interrogator
B06 0760 of Cuban refugees for the Immigration Service.   The
B06 0770 Faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds. The Kennedy
B06 0780 Administration had assured anti-Castro Cubans that it would have
B06 0790 nothing to do with associates of Dictator Batista. Using a Batista
B06 0800 man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic
B06 0810 forces which alone can effectively oppose Castro.   Moreover,
B06 0820 Col& Faget's information on Cuba was too outdated to be
B06 0830 useful in "screening" Castro agents; the Colonel fled to the
B06 0840 friendly haven of the Dominican dictatorship as soon as Castro seized
B06 0850 power. And while he had headed Batista's anti-Communist
B06 0855 section,
B06 0860 the Batista regime did not disturb the Communists so much as more open
B06 0865 opponents who were alleged to be Communists.   Responsibility
B06 0880 for the Faget appointment rests with Gen& J& M& swing, an
B06 0890 Eisenhower appointee as head of the Immigration Service. Gen& Swing
B06 0900 has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the
B06 0910 prerogatives of his office. His official term expired last summer.
B06 0920 Some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend,
B06 0930 Congressman Walter of Pennsylvania, at a moment when the Kennedy
B06 0940 Administration was diligently searching for all the House votes it
B06 0950 could get.   Congressman Walter has been all-powerful in immigration
B06 0960 matters, but he has announced plans to retire in 1962. At that
B06 0970 point the Administration will have little reason to hang onto Gen&
B06 0980 Swing. The Faget case was the kind of salvage job the Administration
B06 0990 should not have to repeat. #MR& EISENHOWER, POLITICIAN# As
B06 1000 President, Dwight D& Eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from
B06 1010 the strife of partisan politics. As a former President, however, Mr&
B06 1020 Eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during
B06 1030 a New York Republican rally, and generally missed his target.
B06 1040    Mr& Eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost
B06 1050 by a Peace Corps girl in Nigeria to attack the entire Corps as a
B06 1060 "juvenile experiment" and to suggest sending a Corps member to the
B06 1070 moon. This was juvenile ridicule. Nowhere did the speaker recognize
B06 1080 the serious purpose of the Corps or its welcome reception abroad. His
B06 1090 words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name
B06 1100 to the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships dedicated to the same goal
B06 1110 of international understanding.   The former President blithely
B06 1120 ignored recent history in speaking of "dollarette" dollars under
B06 1130 Kennedy Administration fiscal policies. It was the Eisenhower Administration
B06 1140 which produced the largest peacetime deficit.   Finally,
B06 1150 Mr& Eisenhower found nothing but confusion in Washington.
B06 1160 This statement recalls the 1959 Berlin crisis, when President Eisenhower
B06 1170 first told reporters that Berlin could not be defended with conventional
B06 1180 weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the
B06 1190 picture too. The crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion
B06 1200 has hardly been compounded.   Ex-Presidents, relieved of accountability
B06 1210 for policy, sometimes seem to feel free of accountability
B06 1220 for their words. Some of former President Truman's off-the-cuff
B06 1230 discourses have been in that vein. Nobody can deny the right of former
B06 1240 Chief Executives to take part in politics, but the American people
B06 1250 expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership
B06 1260 and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility. This is a matter
B06 1270 of respect for the Presidency. Mr& Eisenhower's New York speech
B06 1280 does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship.
B06 1290 #QUEEN OF THE SEAS# The Queen Mary has long been a symbol of
B06 1300 speed, luxury, and impeccable British service on the high seas. Reports
B06 1310 that the venerable liner, which has been in service since 1936, was
B06 1320 to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us. But the Cunard
B06 1330 line, influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment, has
B06 1340 decided to keep the Queen Mary in service until next Spring at least.
B06 1350    A new queen, with the prosaic title of ~Q3, had been planned
B06 1360 for several years to replace the Queen Mary. The British government,
B06 1370 concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding
B06 1380 industry, had put through a bill to give Cunard loans and grants totaling
B06 1390 $50,400,000 toward the $84,000,000 cost of a new 75,000-ton passenger
B06 1400 liner.   Since 1957, more and more trans-Atlantic passengers
B06 1410 have been crossing by air. Economy class fares and charter flights
B06 1420 have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines. Competition
B06 1430 from other steamship lines has cut Cunard's share of sea passengers
B06 1440 from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked
B06 1450 drop of profits on the Atlantic run.   The Cunard line has
B06 1460 under consideration replacing the Queen Mary with a ship smaller than
B06 1470 75,000 tons. This would be cheaper to operate and could be used for
B06 1480 cruises during the lean winter months. Also under consideration is
B06 1490 an increased investment in Cunard Eagle Airways which has applied to
B06 1500 serve New York.   The decline of the Cunard line from its position
B06 1510 of dominance in Atlantic travel is a significant development
B06 1520 in the history of transportation. #MISSION TO VIET NAM# Gen& Maxwell
B06 1530 Taylor's statement in Saigon that he is "very much encouraged"
B06 1540 about the chances of the pro-Western government of Viet Nam
B06 1550 turning back Communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement
B06 1560 that he will not recommend dispatching United States troops to
B06 1570 bolster the Vietnamese Army. Gen& Taylor will report to President
B06 1580 Kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to South Viet
B06 1590 Nam and, judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the Far East,
B06 1600 he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of Vietnamese
B06 1610 military, economic, political and other resources.   There was
B06 1620 good reason for Gen& Taylor to make an inspection trip at this time.
B06 1630 Communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their
B06 1640 activities and the great flood of the Mekong River has interposed a
B06 1650 new crisis. South Viet Nam's rice surplus for next year- more than
B06 1660 300,000 tons- may have been destroyed. The Viet Cong, the Communist
B06 1670 rebels, may have lost their stored grain and arms factories.
B06 1675 The
B06 1680 rebels may try to seize what is left of the October harvest when the
B06 1690 floods recede and the monsoon ends in November.   Nothing that
B06 1700 is likely to happen, however, should prompt the sending of United
B06 1710 States soldiers for other than instructional missions. The Indochina
B06 1720 struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954, when Gen& Ridgway
B06 1730 estimated
B06 1740 it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win
B06 1750 a war the French were losing. It is a war to stay out of today, especially
B06 1760 in view of the fact that President Ngo Dinh Diem apparently
B06 1770 does not want United States troops. He may want additional technical
B06 1780 help, and this should be forthcoming. South Viet Nam has received
B06 1790 $1,450,000,000 in United States aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance
B06 1800 has been stepped up since Vice President Lyndon B& Johnson's
B06 1810 visit last May.   Gen& Taylor, the President's
B06 1820 special military adviser, is a level-headed officer who is not likely
B06 1830 to succumb to propaganda or pressure. It is probable that his recommendations
B06 1840 will be informed and workable, and that they will not lead to
B06 1850 involving the United States in an Asian morass.
B06 1860    Gov& John M& Dalton, himself a lawyer and a man of long
B06 1870 service in government, spoke with rich background and experience when
B06 1880 he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the
B06 1890 Missouri General Assembly, or quit accepting fees from individuals
B06 1900 and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the
B06 1910 government and who are retained, not because of their legal talents,
B06 1920 but because of their government influence.
B07 0010 #THE U& N&'S 'GRAVEST CRISIS'# Ambassador Stevenson yesterday
B07 0020 described the U& N&'s problem of electing a temporary
B07 0030 successor to the late Dag Hammarskjold as "the gravest crisis the
B07 0040 institution has faced". Of course it is. If the decision goes wrong,
B07 0050 it may be- as Mr& Stevenson fears- "the first step on the
B07 0060 slippery path downhill" to a U& N& without operational responsibilities
B07 0070 and without effective meaning.   The integrity of the
B07 0080 office not merely requires that the Secretary General shall be, as
B07 0090 the Charter puts it, "the chief administrative officer of the Organization",
B07 0100 but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions
B07 0110 from any government or any other authority "external to
B07 0120 the Organization". In other words, the Secretary General is to be
B07 0130 a nonpartisan, international servant, not a political, national one.
B07 0140 He should be, as Dag Hammarskjold certainly was, a citizen of the
B07 0150 world.   The Charter does stipulate that "due regard" shall
B07 0160 be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on "as wide a geographical
B07 0170 basis as possible". The United States and its allies have
B07 0180 had no objection to this. What they have objected to is the attempt
B07 0190 of the Russians to make use of the tragedy of Dag Hammarskjold's
B07 0200 death to turn the entire U& N& staff from the Secretary down
B07 0210 into political agents of the respective countries from which they come.
B07 0220    The controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic
B07 0230 origin of the deputies of the Secretary General and, more particularly,
B07 0240 around the nature of his relationship with them. Although
B07 0250 the United States and the U& S& S& R& have been arguing
B07 0260 whether there shall be four, five or six top assistants, the most important
B07 0270 element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the
B07 0280 manner in which these deputies are to do their work.   If any one
B07 0290 of them has any power to veto the Secretary General's decisions
B07 0300 the nature of the organization will have changed. If they give him advice
B07 0310 when he asks it, or if they perform specified duties under his direction,
B07 0320 the nature of the U& N& will not of necessity change.
B07 0330 The Secretary General must have, subject to the constitutional direction
B07 0340 of the Security Council and the General Assembly, the power
B07 0350 to act, to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled
B07 0360 by advisers and assistants acting on someone else's instructions.
B07 0370    This is the root issue for which the United States should stand.
B07 0380 We should not become confused or let our public become confused over
B07 0390 irrelevant questions of number or even of geography. What we must
B07 0400 have, if the United Nations is to survive, is as nonpolitical, nonpartisan
B07 0410 an organization at the top as human beings can make it, subject
B07 0420 to no single nation's direction and subservient to no single nation's
B07 0430 ambition. #WHAT THE NEW CHARTER DOES# The new City Charter,
B07 0440 which should get a Yes vote as Question No& 1 on Nov& 7, would
B07 0450 not make a good Mayor out of a bad one. There is no such magic
B07 0460 in man-made laws. But it would greatly strengthen any Mayor's executive
B07 0470 powers, remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of
B07 0480 inaction in the Board of Estimate, increase his budget-making authority
B07 0490 both as to expense and capital budgets, and vest in him the right
B07 0500 to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy.
B07 0510    Lawmaking power is removed from the Board of Estimate
B07 0515 and made
B07 0520 a partnership responsibility of the City Council and the Mayor. Thus
B07 0530 there is a clearer division of authority, administrative and legislative.
B07 0540 The board is diminished in both respects, while it retains control
B07 0550 over zoning, franchises, pier leases, sale, leasing and assignment
B07 0560 of property, and other trusteeship functions. The board will be able
B07 0570 to increase, decrease, add or eliminate budget items, subject to the
B07 0580 Mayor's veto; but the City Council will now share fully this
B07 0590 budget-altering power. Overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes
B07 0600 will require concurrence by board and Council, and a two-thirds vote.
B07 0610    The Controller retains his essential "fiscal watchdog" functions;
B07 0620 his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed.
B07 0630 He loses now-misplaced tax collection duties, which go to the Finance
B07 0640 Department. On net balance, in spite of Controller Gerosa's
B07 0650 opposition to the new Charter as an invasion of his office, the Controller
B07 0660 will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government
B07 0670 than he has now.   Borough Presidents, while retaining
B07 0680 membership in the Board of Estimate, lose their housekeeping functions.
B07 0690 Highways go to a new Department of Highways, sewers to the Department
B07 0700 of Public Works, such street cleaning as Borough Presidents
B07 0710 now do (in Queens and Richmond) to the Sanitation Department.
B07 0720    Some fiscal changes are important. The expense (operating) budget
B07 0730 is to be a program budget, and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy
B07 0740 (with the Mayor approving) in fund transfers within a department.
B07 0750 The capital budget, for construction of permanent improvements, becomes
B07 0760 an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises;
B07 0770 but, as a second-look safeguard, each new project must undergo
B07 0780 a Board of Estimate public hearing before construction proceeds.
B07 0790    A road block to desirable local or borough improvements, heretofore
B07 0800 dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on
B07 0810 progress, is removed by making these a charge against the whole city
B07 0820 instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected. This will
B07 0830 have a beneficial effect by expediting public business; it will also
B07 0840 correct some injustices.   Enlargement of the City Council
B07 0850 and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow.
B07 0860 #INTER-AMERICAN PRESS# The Inter-american Press Association,
B07 0870 which blankets the Western Hemisphere from northern Canada to Cape
B07 0880 Horn, is meeting in New York City this week for the first time in
B07 0890 eleven years. The I& A& P& A& is a reflection of the problems
B07 0900 and hopes of the hemisphere; and in these days this inevitably
B07 0910 means a concentration on the effects of the Cuban revolution.
B07 0920 As the press in Cuba was gradually throttled by the Castro regime,
B07 0930 more and more Cuban publishers, editors and correspondents were forced
B07 0940 into exile. The I& A& P& A& found itself driven from journalism
B07 0950 into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall
B07 0960 of the Castro Government and the return of the Cuban press to the
B07 0970 freedom it knew before Batista's dictatorship began in 1952.
B07 0980 Freedom of the press was lost in Cuba because of decades of corruption
B07 0990 and social imbalances. In such conditions all freedoms are lost.
B07 1000 This, in more diplomatic language, is what Adlai Stevenson told the
B07 1010 newspaper men of Latin America yesterday on behalf of the United States
B07 1020 Government. He felt able to end on a note of hope. He sees evidence
B07 1030 of fair winds for the ten-year Alliance for Progress plan with
B07 1040 its emphasis on social reforms. No group can contribute more to the
B07 1050 success of the program than the editors and publishers of the Inter-American
B07 1060 Press Association. #MEETING IN MOSCOW# The Twenty-second
B07 1070 Soviet Communist Party Congress opens in Moscow today in a
B07 1080 situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago
B07 1090 when this meeting was first announced. According to the original program,
B07 1100 Premier Khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the Kremlin
B07 1110 this morning to be filled with admiration or rage- depending
B07 1120 upon individual or national politics- because of the "bold program
B07 1130 for building communism in our time" which the Congress will adopt.
B07 1140 But far from being concerned about whether or not Russia will have
B07 1150 achieved Utopia by 1980, the world is watching Moscow today primarily
B07 1160 for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear Armageddon in
B07 1170 the immediate future.   The evident contradiction between the rosy
B07 1180 picture of Russia's progress painted by the Communist party's
B07 1190 program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by Premier
B07 1200 Khrushchev's Berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that
B07 1210 the program may be severely altered. Whether it is or not, the propaganda
B07 1220 impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted
B07 1230 at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated.
B07 1240 And there must be many Soviet citizens who know what is going on
B07 1250 and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised
B07 1260 for 1980 they and their children must first survive.   This
B07 1270 Congress will see Premier Khrushchev consolidating his power and
B07 1280 laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness
B07 1290 remove him from the scene in the next few years. The widespread purge
B07 1300 that has taken place the past twelve months or so among Communist
B07 1310 leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who
B07 1320 will dominate the Congress, and the Central Committee it will elect,
B07 1330 will all have passed the tightest possible Khrushchev screening, both
B07 1340 for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job.
B07 1350 #DR& CONANT'S CALL TO ACTION# Dr& James B& Conant has
B07 1360 earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer.
B07 1370 His earlier reports considered the American public schools
B07 1380 basically sound and not in need of drastic change. Now, a close look
B07 1390 at the schools in and around the ten largest cities, including New York,
B07 1400 has shattered this optimism. Dr& Conant has come away shocked
B07 1410 and angry. His new book, entitled "Slums and Suburbs", calls for
B07 1420 fast and drastic action to avert disaster.   There is room for
B07 1430 disagreement concerning some of Dr& Conant's specific views. His
B07 1440 strong opposition to the transfer of Negro children to schools outside
B07 1450 their own neighborhood, in the interest of integration, will be
B07 1460 attacked by Negro leaders who have fought for, and achieved, this open
B07 1470 or permissive enrollment. Dr& Conant may underestimate the psychological
B07 1480 importance of even token equality.   His suggestion that
B07 1490 the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical,
B07 1500 law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges
B07 1510 themselves- even though what he is recommending is already taking
B07 1520 shape as a trend.   But these are side issues to a powerful
B07 1530 central theme. That theme cuts through hypocrisies, complacency and
B07 1540 double-talk. It labels the slums, especially the Negro slums, as dead-end
B07 1550 streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters. The villains
B07 1560 of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters,
B07 1570 and Dr& Conant accuses employers and labor unions alike. The facts,
B07 1580 he adds, are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling
B07 1590 bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration
B07 1600 rather than on real improvement of the schools, regardless of
B07 1610 the color of their students.   A call for action "before it
B07 1620 is too late" has alarming implications when it comes from a man who,
B07 1625 in his
B07 1630 previous reports on the schools, cautioned so strongly against extreme
B07 1640 measures. These warnings must not be treated lightly. Dr& Conant's
B07 1650 conscientious, selfless efforts deserve the nation's
B07 1655 gratitude.
B07 1660 He has served in positions of greater glamour, both at home and abroad;
B07 1670 but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward
B07 1680 report on the state of the public schools.
B07 1690 #AND NOW- MORE JUNK MAIL# A fascinating letter has just reached
B07 1700 this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk mail.
B07 1710 He was delighted to learn that the Post Office Department is now
B07 1720 going to expand this service to deliver mail from Representatives
B07 1730 in Congress to their constituents without the use of stamps, names, addresses
B07 1740 or even zone numbers. In accordance with legislation passed
B07 1750 at the last session of Congress, each Representative is authorized to
B07 1760 deliver to the Post Office in bulk newsletters, speeches and other
B07 1770 literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district. This means
B07 1780 an added burden to innumerable postmen, who already are complaining
B07 1790 of heavy loads and low pay, and it presumably means an increased postal
B07 1800 deficit, but, our correspondent writes, think of the additional junk
B07 1810 mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis.
B07 1820 @ #OUR CREDITORS DO NOT FORGET US# Letter writing is a dying
B07 1830 art. Occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and
B07 1840 many are written by companies to one another, but these are mostly
B07 1850 typewritten. Most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly
B07 1860 be called a letter.
B08 0010    Old, tired, trembling the woman came to the cannery. She had,
B08 0020 she said, heard that the plant was closing. It couldn't close, she
B08 0030 said. She had raised a calf, grown it beef-fat. She had, with her own
B08 0040 work-weary hands, put seeds in the ground, watched them sprout, bud,
B08 0050 blossom, and get ready to bear. She was ready to kill the beef, dress
B08 0060 it out, and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup, broth,
B08 0070 hash, and stew against the winter. She had done it last year, and
B08 0080 the year before, and the year before that, and she, and her people
B08 0090 were dependent upon these cans for food.   This did not happen in
B08 0100 counties of North Georgia, where the rivers run and make rich the
B08 0110 bottom land. Nor in South Georgia, where the summer sun shines warmly
B08 0120 and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields.
B08 0130    This happened in Decatur, DeKalb County, not 10 miles from the
B08 0140 heart of metropolitian Atlanta.   And now, the woman, tired and
B08 0150 trembling, came here to the DeKalb County cannery. "Is it so the
B08 0160 cannery is going to close"?   O& N& Moss, 61, tall,
B08 0170 grey as a possum, canning plant chief since 1946, didn't know what
B08 0180 to say. He did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this
B08 0190 summer. He did say he was out of cans, the No& 3's, but "I requisitioned
B08 0200 22,000". He said he had No& 2's enough to last two
B08 0210 weeks more.   Threat of closing the cannery is a recent one. A
B08 0220 three-man committee has recommended to Commission Chairman Charles
B08 0230 O& Emmerich that the DeKalb County cannery be closed. Reason:
B08 0240 the cannery loses $3,000 yearly.   But DeKalb citizens, those
B08 0250 who use the facilities of the cannery, say the cannery is not supposed
B08 0260 to make any money.   "The cannery", said Mrs& Lewellyn
B08 0270 Lundeen, an active booster of the cannery since its opening during
B08 0280 the war and rationing years of 1941, to handle the "victory garden"
B08 0290 produce, "is a service to the taxpayer. And one of the best services
B08 0300 available to the people who try to raise and can meat, to plant,
B08 0310 grow vegetables and put them up. It helps those people who help themselves.
B08 0320    "The county, though, seems more interested in those
B08 0330 people who don't even try, those who sit and draw welfare checks and
B08 0340 line up for surplus food".   A driver of a dairy truck, who
B08 0350 begins work at 1 a&m& finishes before breakfast, then goes out and
B08 0360 grows a garden, and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family
B08 0370 of five, asked, "What in the world will we do"?   "What
B08 0380 in the world", echoed others, those come with the beans, potatoes,
B08 0390 the tomatoes, "will any of us do"?   Moss, a man who knows
B08 0400 how much the cannery helps the county, doesn't believe it will close.
B08 0410 But he is in the middle, an employe of DeKalb, but on the side
B08 0420 of the people.   The young married people; the old couples. The
B08 0430 dairy truck driver; the old woman with the stew.   "Don't
B08 0440 ask me if I think the cannery helps", he said. "Sir, I know
B08 0450 the cannery helps".
B08 0460    Most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard.
B08 0470 When a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or
B08 0480 hardship it is not always easy to say, "Just forget it". There
B08 0490 is one thing I know; a person will never have spiritual poise and inner
B08 0500 peace as long as the heart holds a grudge. I know a man who held
B08 0510 resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades. Several years
B08 0520 ago I was his pastor. One night, at the close of the evening service,
B08 0530 he came forward, left his resentment at the altar and gave his
B08 0540 heart to God. After almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story
B08 0550 of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on
B08 0560 his land.   "We tried to settle this dispute", he said, "but
B08 0570 could never come to an agreement. I settled it tonight", he continued.
B08 0580 "I leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has
B08 0590 been lifted off my heart, I have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven
B08 0600 my neighbor".   Forgiveness is the door through which a
B08 0610 person must pass to enter the Kingdom of God. You cannot wear the banner
B08 0620 of God and at the same time harbor envy, jealousy and grudges in
B08 0630 your heart. Henry van Dyke said, "Forgive and forget if you can;
B08 0640 but forgive anyway".   Jesus made three things clear about
B08 0650 forgiveness. We must, first of all, be willing to forgive others before
B08 0660 we can secure God's forgiveness. "For if ye forgive men their
B08 0670 trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye
B08 0680 forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive
B08 0690 your trespasses". Matthew 6:14-15. It will do no good to seek
B08 0700 God's forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong.
B08 0710    Then, Jesus indicated that God's forgiveness is unlimited.
B08 0720 In the prayer Jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these
B08 0730 words, "Forgive us our debts". When a person meets God's requirements
B08 0740 for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven. God's mercy
B08 0750 and patience will last forever. Forgiveness implies more than a person
B08 0760 wanting his past sins covered by God's love. It also implies
B08 0770 that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past.
B08 0780 We want the past forgiven, but at the same time we must be willing for
B08 0790 God to direct the future.   Finally, we must be willing to forgive
B08 0800 others as many times as they sin against us. Once Peter asked,
B08 0810 "How oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Till
B08 0820 seven times? Jesus saith unto him, until seventy times seven".
B08 0830 Matthew 18:21-22.   Jesus not only taught forgiveness, He
B08 0840 gave us an example of it on the cross. With all the energy of his broken
B08 0850 body he prayed, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what
B08 0860 they do". Luke 23:34.
B08 0870    She's been in and out of my house for a dozen years now, although
B08 0880 she's still a teen-ager who looks like a baby, she is getting
B08 0890 married. Her mother, now dead, was my good friend and when she came to
B08 0900 tell us about her plans and to show off her ring I had a sobering wish
B08 0910 to say something meaningful to her, something her mother would wish
B08 0920 said. For a while there was such shrill girlish commotion I couldn't
B08 0930 have made myself heard if I'd had the equivalent of the message
B08 0940 to Garcia. But when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been
B08 0950 through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young
B08 0960 female- six girls sprawled on one bed, drinking Cokes and giggling-
B08 0970 she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute.   "How
B08 0980 do you know you love somebody enough to get married"? she asked.
B08 0990    It was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have
B08 1000 ever asked: How can you be sure?   "Aren't you sure"?
B08 1010 I asked, looking at her searchingly. I wanted to grab her by the
B08 1020 arm and beg her to wait, to consider, to know for certain because life
B08 1030 is so long and marriage is so important. But if she were just having
B08 1040 a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten
B08 1050 her out of a really good marriage. Besides, in all honesty, I don't
B08 1060 know how you can be sure. I don't know any secret recipe for certainty.
B08 1070 In the fevered, intoxicating, breathless state of being in love
B08 1080 the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships
B08 1090 are sometimes obscured. I knew of but one test and I threw it
B08 1100 out to her for what it was worth.   "Does he ever bore you"?
B08 1110 I asked.   "Bore me"? she was shocked. Oh, no-o! Why,
B08 1120 he's so darling and **h"   "I mean", I went on ruthlessly,
B08 1130 "when he's not talking about you or himself or the wonders
B08 1140 of love, is he interesting? Does he care about things that matter
B08 1150 to you? Can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island
B08 1160 for years and years and still find him fascinating?   Because,
B08 1170 honey, I thought silently, there are plenty of desert islands in
B08 1180 every marriage- long periods when you're hopelessly stranded, together.
B08 1190 And if you bore each other then, heaven help you.   She came
B08 1200 back the other day to reassure me. She has studied and observed and
B08 1210 she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting.
B08 1220    She asked if I had other advice and, heady with success,
B08 1230 I rushed it in, I hope not too late. Be friends with your mother-in-law.
B08 1240 Jokes, cartoons and cynics to the contrary, mothers-in-law make
B08 1250 good friends.
B08 1260    I do not know Dr& Wilson Sneed well. But I was deeply moved
B08 1270 by his letter of resignation as rector of St& Luke's Church
B08 1280 in Atlanta. It was the cry of not just one heart; it spoke for many
B08 1290 in the clergy, I suspect. The pulpit is a lonely place. Who stops
B08 1300 to think of that?   Imagine the searching and the prayer that
B08 1310 lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service
B08 1320 to this majestic church. "Such a church needs vigor and vitality
B08 1330 in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments",
B08 1340 he told his members.   A minister should not stay "beyond the
B08 1350 time that his leadership should benefit" his church, he wrote, "**h
B08 1360 for he becomes ordinary **h". @ ## And so the young minister
B08 1370 resigned, to go and study and pray, having never passed a day, he
B08 1380 told his parishioners, when "I did not gain from you far more than
B08 1390 I ever gave to you".   His very honest act called up the recent
B08 1400 talk I had with another minister, a modest Methodist, who said:
B08 1410 "I feel so deeply blessed by God when I can give a message of love
B08 1420 and comfort to other men, and I would have it no other way: and
B08 1430 it is unworthy to think of self. But oh, how I do sometimes need just
B08 1440 a moment of rest, and peace, in myself".   A man who gives
B08 1450 himself to God and to the believers of his church takes upon himself
B08 1460 a life of giving. He does not expect to get great riches or he would
B08 1470 not have chosen to answer the call to preach. The good ones are not
B08 1480 motivated to seek vainly, nor are they disposed to covet comfort, or they
B08 1490 would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity.
B08 1500 Theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards. ## Yet we who
B08 1510 lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation
B08 1520 of the infinite through him- we who readily accept his sacrifice
B08 1530 as our due, we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is
B08 1540 in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul. We press
B08 1550 him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions
B08 1560 with his word, and God's. We do not defeat the good ones
B08 1570 with this cruelty, but we add to their burden, while expecting them
B08 1580 to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance
B08 1590 and a few bucks a week, American cash. If we break the minister
B08 1600 to our bit, we are buying back our own sins. If he won't break, we
B08 1610 add to the stress he bears.   And a minister of all men is most
B08 1620 conscious that he is mere man- prone to the stresses that earthly
B08 1630 humanity is heir to. We expect him to be noble, and to make us so-
B08 1640 yet he knows, and tries to tell us, how very humble man must be.
B08 1650    We expect bestowal of God's love through him. But how little love
B08 1660 we give him. The church truly is not a rest home for saints, but a
B08 1670 hospital for sinners. Yet every Sunday we sinners go to that emergency
B08 1680 room to receive first aid, and we leave unmindful that the man who
B08 1690 ministered to us is a human being who suffers, too.
B09 0010    Mr& Podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each
B09 0020 summer at Loon Lake. The narrow fringe of sadness that ran around
B09 0030 it only emphasized the pleasure.   The evening was not always
B09 0040 spent in the same way. This year, on a night cool with the front of September
B09 0050 moving in, but with plenty of summer still about, the Podgers
B09 0060 were holding a neighborhood gathering in the Pod. The little cottage
B09 0070 was bursting with people of all ages.   In the midst of it all,
B09 0080 Mr& Podger came out on the Pod porch, alone. He had that day
B09 0090 attended a country auction, and he had come back with a prize.
B09 0100 The prize was an old-fashioned, woven cloth hammock, complete with cross-top
B09 0110 pillow, fringed side pieces, and hooks for hanging. Mrs& Podger
B09 0120 had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for
B09 0130 it, and there it was, slung in a vine-shaded corner, the night breeze
B09 0140 rippling its fringe with a slow, caressing movement.   Mr&
B09 0150 Podger sat down in it, pushed himself back and forth in one or two
B09 0160 slow, rhythmic motions, and then swung his feet up into it. He closed
B09 0170 his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly
B09 0180 over him. Suddenly one young voice rose above the others. "But",
B09 0190 it said, "do you always <know> when you're happy"?
B09 0200 The voice sank back into the general tangle of sound, but the question
B09 0210 stayed in Mr& Podger's mind. Here, in the cool, autumn-touched
B09 0220 evening, Mr& Podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly
B09 0230 contented and at peace. #@# It had begun with the blue jay
B09 0240 feather. Walking along the lake before breakfast, Mr& Podger had
B09 0250 seen the feather, and the bird that had lost it in flight. The winging
B09 0260 spread of blue had gone on, calling harshly, into the wood. The
B09 0270 small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet. All
B09 0280 day long Mr& Podger, who was a straw-hat man in the summer, had
B09 0285 worn
B09 0290 the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield. Would a blue
B09 0300 feather in a man's hat make him happy all day? Hardly. But it
B09 0310 was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning
B09 0320 sunshine, linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by
B09 0330 the lake.   Then, since the auction was being held nearby, he had
B09 0340 walked to it. And there, on the way, had been the box turtle, that
B09 0350 slow, self-contained, world-ignoring relic of pre-history, bent, for
B09 0360 reasons best known to itself, on crossing the road. It was doing very
B09 0370 well, too, having reached the center, and was pursuing its way with commendable
B09 0380 singleness of purpose when Mr& Podger saw hazard approaching
B09 0390 in the shape of a flashy little sports car. Would the driver see
B09 0400 the turtle? Would he take pains to avoid it?   Mr& Podger
B09 0410 took no chances. Taking off his hat and signaling the driver with
B09 0420 it, Mr& Podger stepped into the road, lifted the surprised turtle
B09 0430 and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking
B09 0440 suddenness.   The turtle immediately withdrew into its private
B09 0450 council room to study the phenomenon. But Mr& Podger and the
B09 0460 driver of the sports car waved at each other. Here in the cool darkness
B09 0470 Mr& Podger could still feel the warmth of midday, could still
B09 0480 see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road, could still see the
B09 0490 friendly grin on the young, sun-browned face as the driver looked back
B09 0500 over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight.
B09 0510    Where was the driver now? What was he doing? And the turtle?
B09 0520 Mr& Podger smiled. For a few brief minutes they had all been
B09 0530 part of one little drama. The three would never meet again, but for
B09 0540 some reason or other Mr& Podger was sure he would always remember
B09 0550 the incident.   Then there had been the auction itself. Mr&
B09 0560 Podger heard again, at will, the voice of the auctioneer, the voices
B09 0570 of the bidders, and finally the small boy who had been so interested
B09 0580 in Mr& Podger's hammock purchase.   "I like them things,
B09 0590 too", he had said. "We got one at home. You know what? If
B09 0600 you're lyin' out in the hammock at night, and it gets kinda cool-
B09 0610 you know- you just take these sides with the fringe on- see-
B09 0620 and wrap 'em right over you. I do it, lots o' times- I like to
B09 0630 lie in a hammock at night, by myself, when it's all quiet. **h The
B09 0640 wind moves it a little bit- you know **h". #@# Mr& Podger
B09 0645 had
B09 0650 thanked him gravely, and now he made use of the advice. As he pulled
B09 0660 the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon, Mr& Podger
B09 0670 saw that thin, attractive, freckled little face again, and hoped that
B09 0680 the boy, too, was lying in a cool, fringed-wrapped quiet.   Alacrity,
B09 0690 the Podger cat, came by the hammock, rubbed her back briefly
B09 0700 against it, and then, sure of a welcome, hopped up. She remarked that
B09 0710 she found the night wind a little chilly, and Mr& Podger took her
B09 0720 inside the fringe. Soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree
B09 0730 crickets, rivaled the hum of voices from inside the Pod.   Mr&
B09 0740 Podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen
B09 0750 door opened and Pam burst out. "Dad"! she said. "It's
B09 0760 getting so chilly we've lighted a fire, and we're going to tell
B09 0770 a round robin story- a nice, scary one. We need you to start it. Why
B09 0780 are you out here all by yourself? Aren't you happy"?
B09 0790    Mr& Podger opened his cocoon and emerged, tucking Alacrity under
B09 0800 his arm to bring her in by the fire. "Of course I am", he said.
B09 0810 "Never happier in my life. I just came out here to know it".
B09 0820 _DALLAS_ As the South begins another school year, national and even
B09 0830 world
B09 0840 attention is directed at the region's slow progress toward racial
B09 0850 equality in the public schools.   Desegregation is beginning in
B09 0860 two more important Southern cities- Dallas and Atlanta. In each
B09 0870 city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public
B09 0880 opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment.
B09 0890    These programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully.
B09 0900 The programs do not take sides on the issue itself. They point
B09 0910 out simply that "it is the law of the land".   The two
B09 0920 cities have the examples of Little Rock and New Orleans to hold up
B09 0930 as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes
B09 0940 of desegregation. Even better, they have the examples of Nashville
B09 0950 and Houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs.
B09 0960 In each case there was an initial act of violence. In Nashville, a
B09 0970 school was dynamited. In Houston, there were a few incidents of friction
B09 0980 between whites and Negroes, none of which were serious.   In
B09 0990 each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government
B09 1000 halted the threats of more serious incidents.   The Nashville
B09 1010 plan, incidentally, has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable
B09 1020 and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled South.
B09 1030 It is a "stair-step" plan, in which desegregation begins in
B09 1040 the first grade. Each year another grade is added to the process, until
B09 1050 finally all 12 grades are integrated. The schedules are flexible
B09 1060 so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant
B09 1070 or realizes that it is something that has to be done, "so why
B09 1080 not now".   The program has worked well in both Nashville and
B09 1090 Houston. It met a serious rebuff in New Orleans, where the two schools
B09 1100 selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by
B09 1110 white parents. Another attempt will be made this year in New Orleans
B09 1120 to resume the program.   Generally, throughout the South,
B09 1125 there is a
B09 1130 growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every
B09 1140 step of desegregation is met.   Perhaps the most eloquent move
B09 1150 toward removal of racial barriers has been in Dallas. During the summer,
B09 1160 Negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants
B09 1170 and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments. It was part
B09 1180 of a citywide move toward full integration.   So successful has
B09 1190 been this program, worked out by white and Negro civic leaders, that
B09 1200 further extensions are expected in the next few months. Hotels, for
B09 1210 example, are ready to let down the bars. Already, at least one hotel
B09 1220 has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis. Several conventions
B09 1230 have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated
B09 1240 basis.   This is a radical change in attitude from the conditions
B09 1250 which prevailed several years ago, when a series of bombings was directed
B09 1260 against Negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods
B09 1270 of Dallas.   It is also symptomatic of a change in attitude
B09 1280 which appears to be spreading all across the South. Southern
B09 1290 whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence
B09 1300 to try to stop Negroes from claiming equal rights. They insist
B09 1310 they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in Alabama
B09 1320 when the Freedom Riders sought to break down racial discrimination
B09 1330 in local bus depots.   All across the South there are signs
B09 1340 that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves
B09 1350 would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant
B09 1360 attitude toward it.   There are many causes for this change. One
B09 1370 of the most important is economic. Business leaders are aware now
B09 1380 that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence. They are putting
B09 1390 strong pressure on their police departments to keep order. In the
B09 1400 past these same Southerners were inclined to look the other way.
B09 1410    And as the businessmen have begun to act, a real sense of
B09 1415 co-operation
B09 1420 has sprung up. This co-operation has emboldened other Southern whites
B09 1430 to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation. They
B09 1440 realize that by acting in concert, rather than individually, they will
B09 1450 not be picked out as objects of retaliation- economic and
B09 1460 otherwise.
B09 1470    Since moving from a Chicago suburb to Southern California a
B09 1480 few months ago, I've been introduced to a new game called Lanesmanship.
B09 1490 Played mostly on the freeways around Los Angeles, it goes like
B09 1500 this:   A driver cruising easily at 70 m&p&h& in Lane
B09 1510 ~A of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead. Traffic
B09 1520 in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes
B09 1530 a tentative fender into Lane ~B, which is heavily populated by cars
B09 1540 also moving at 70 m&p&h&.   The adjacent driver in Lane
B09 1550 ~B has three choices open to him. He can (1) point his car resolutely
B09 1560 at the invading fender and force the other driver back into Lane
B09 1570 ~A; (2) slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes;
B09 1580 or (3) alternately accelerate and decelerate, thus keeping the
B09 1590 first driver guessing as to his intentions, thereby making a fascinating
B09 1600 sport of the whole affair.   The really remarkable thing to
B09 1610 me is that most California natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down
B09 1620 and permit the invading car free access. Whether or not this is done
B09 1630 out of enlightened self-preservation, I don't know. But it is done,
B09 1640 consistently and I'm both surprised and impressed. #@# This
B09 1650 could never happen in my native Chicago. There such soggy acquiesence
B09 1660 would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood. In
B09 1670 Chicago, the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor
B09 1680 in an effort to force the other car back. Failing this, he would pull
B09 1690 alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly.
B09 1700    This negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways, however,
B09 1710 does an injustice to Southern California drivers. At the risk
B09 1720 of losing my charge-a-plate at Marshall Field and Company, I would
B09 1730 like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype. After three months
B09 1750 of research, I can state unequivocally that Los Angeles drivers are
B09 1760 considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers I've
B09 1770 ever encountered.   During one recent day of driving about Los
B09 1780 Angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers
B09 1790 stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible
B09 1800 side street.
B10 0010 _MIAMI, FLA&, MARCH 17._ An out-of-town writer came up to Paul
B10 0020 Richards today and asked the Oriole manager if he thought his ball
B10 0030 club would be improved this year.   Now Richards, of course, is
B10 0040 known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go. He can often make the
B10 0050 complex ridiculously simple, and vice versa. This happened to be
B10 0055 vice versa, but even so, the answer
B10 0060 was a masterpiece.   "It's a whole lot easier", he said,
B10 0070 "to increase the population of Nevada, than it is to increase the
B10 0080 population of New York city". And with that he walked off to give
B10 0090 instruction to a rookie pitcher.   "That is undoubtedly a hell
B10 0100 of a quote", said the writer, scratching his head. "Now, if I
B10 0110 can just figure out what he's talking about, I'll use it". #TWO
B10 0120 SPOTS OPEN# This was just Richard's way of saying that last
B10 0130 year the Birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open.
B10 0140 Some brilliant rookies nailed them down, so that this spring just two
B10 0150 spots, left and right field, are really up for grabs.   It should
B10 0160 be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots
B10 0170 that were open last year, but so far it hasn't worked that way.
B10 0180    This angle of just where the Orioles can look for improvement this
B10 0190 year is an interesting one. You'd never guess it from the way they've
B10 0200 played so far this spring, but there remains a feeling among some
B10 0210 around here that the Orioles still have a chance to battle for the
B10 0220 pennant in 1961.   Obviously, if this club is going to move from
B10 0230 second to first in the American League, it will have to show improvement
B10 0240 someplace. Where can that improvement possibly come from?
B10 0250    You certainly can't expect the infield to do any better than
B10 0260 it did last year. #ROBBY COULD BE BETTER# Brooks Robinson is great,
B10 0270 and it is conceivable that he'll do even better in 1961 than he
B10 0280 did in 1960. You can't expect it, though. Robby's performance last
B10 0290 year was tremendous.   It's the same with Ron Hansen and
B10 0300 jim Gentile. If they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no
B10 0310 complaint. They shouldn't be asked to carry any more of the burden.
B10 0320    Hansen will be getting a late spring training start, which might
B10 0330 very well set him back. He got off to an exceptional start last season,
B10 0340 and under the circumstances probably won't duplicate it.
B10 0350    There are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching
B10 0360 to him last year. They don't expect to stop him, just slow him
B10 0370 down some with the bat. He'll still be a top player, they concede,
B10 0380 because he's got a great glove and the long ball going for him. But
B10 0390 they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production. #BREEDING
B10 0400 MIGHT MOVE UP# Gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs.
B10 0410 Don't ask him more.   I have a hunch Marv Breeding might move
B10 0420 up a notch. But even so, he had a good year in 1960 and won't do
B10 0430 too much better.   So, all in all, the infield can't be expected
B10 0440 to supply the added improvement to propel the Birds from second
B10 0450 to first.   And the pitching will also have trouble doing better.
B10 0470 Richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and
B10 0480 experience last season.   Where, then, can we look for improvement?
B10 0500    "From Triandos, Brandt and Walker", answers Richards.
B10 0510 "They're the ones we can expect to do better".   The
B10 0520 man is right, and at this time, indications are that these three are
B10 0530 ready for better seasons.   Triandos hasn't proved it yet, but
B10 0540 he says he's convinced his thumb is all right. He jammed it this
B10 0550 spring and has had to rest it, but he says the old injury hasn't bothered
B10 0560 him. If he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years,
B10 0570 the club will have to be better off offensively.   I'm still
B10 0580 not convinced, though, I'll have to see more of him before predicting
B10 0590 that big year for him. Hank Foiles, backed up by Frank House
B10 0610 who will be within calling distance in the minors, make up better second
B10 0620 line catching than the Birds had all last year, but Gus is still
B10 0630 that big man you need when you start talking pennant.   To me,
B10 0635 Brandt
B10 0640 looks as though he could be in for a fine year. He hasn't played
B10 0650 too much, because Richards has been working on him furiously in batting
B10 0660 practice. He's hitting the ball hard, in the batting cage, and
B10 0670 his whole attitude is improved over this time last year.   When
B10 0680 he came to Baltimore, he was leaving a team which was supposed to win
B10 0690 the National League pennant, and he was joining what seemed to be
B10 0700 a second division American League club. He was down, hard to talk
B10 0705 to,
B10 0710 and far too nonchalant on the field. As of now, that all seems behind
B10 0720 him. He's been entirely different all spring.   And Walker
B10 0730 looks stronger, seems to be throwing better than he did last year. Let
B10 0740 him bounce back, and he could really set up the staff.   So,
B10 0750 if the Orioles are to improve, Brandt, Triandos and Walker will have
B10 0760 to do it.   So far the platoons on left and right fielders don't
B10 0770 seem capable of carrying the load.   Of course, this isn't
B10 0780 taking into consideration the population of Nevada and New York
B10 0790 city, but it's the way things look from here at this point.
B10 0800    Is the mother of an "autistic" child at fault? (The "autistic"
B10 0810 child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self.
B10 0820 He tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects-
B10 0830 and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people.) Did his
B10 0840 mother make him this way?   Some people believe she did.
B10 0850    We think differently. We believe that autism, like so many other conditions
B10 0860 of defect and deviation, is to a large extent inborn. A mother
B10 0870 can help a child adapt to his difficulties.   Sometimes she
B10 0880 can- to a large extent- help him overcome them. But we don't think
B10 0890 she creates them. We don't think she can make her child defective,
B10 0900 emotionally disturbed or autistic.   The mother of a difficult
B10 0910 child can do a great deal to help her own child and often, by sharing
B10 0920 her experiences, she can help other mothers with the same problem.
B10 0930 Since little is known about autism, and almost nothing has been written
B10 0940 for the layman, we'd like to share one experienced mother's comments.
B10 0950 She wrote: #TOTAL DISINTEREST# "As the mother of an autistic
B10 0960 child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything,
B10 0970 I have to manipulate my son's fingers for him when he
B10 0980 first
B10 0990 plays with a new toy. He wants me to do everything for him.   "You
B10 1000 don't believe that autistic children become autistic because of
B10 1010 something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats
B10 1020 them. But I do and my psychiatrist does, too. I know, that my
B10 1030 son wants control and direction, but being autistic myself I cannot give
B10 1040 full control or direction.   "One thing I notice which I
B10 1050 have seldom heard mentioned. This is that autistic people don't enjoy
B10 1060 physical contact with others- for instance, my children and I.
B10 1070 When I hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is
B10 1080 as straight and stiff as a board. He pushes and straightens himself
B10 1090 as if he can't stand the feeling of being held. Physical contact is
B10 1100 uncomforatble for him"!   This mother is quite correct. As
B10 1110 a rule, the autistic child doesn't enjoy physical contact with others.
B10 1120 Parents have to find other ways of comforting him. For the young
B10 1130 child this may be no more than providing food, light or movement. As
B10 1140 he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object
B10 1150 (his "magic" thing). Or certain words or rituals that child and
B10 1160 adult go through may do the trick. The answer is different for each autistic
B10 1170 child, but for most there is an answer. Only ingenuity will uncover
B10 1180 it. #WHAT FUTURE HOLDS# "Dear Doctors: We learned this
B10 1190 year that our older son, Daniel, is autistic. We did not accept the
B10 1200 diagnosis at once, but gradually we are coming to. Fortunately, there
B10 1210 is a nursery school which he has been able to attend, with a group
B10 1220 of normal children.   "I try to treat Daniel as if he were normal,
B10 1230 though of course I realize he is far from that at present. What
B10 1240 I do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible.
B10 1250 I try to give him as many normal experiences as possible.
B10 1260    "What is your experience with autistic children? How do they
B10 1270 turn out later"?   Many autistic children grow up to lead
B10 1280 relatively normal lives. Certainly, most continue to lack a certain warmth
B10 1290 in communication with other people, but many adjust to school, even
B10 1300 college, to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood. #SINGLE-COLOR
B10 1310 USE#
B10 1320 _QUESTION_- <A first grader colors pictures one solid color,
B10 1330 everything- sky, grass, boy, wagon, etc&. When different colors
B10 1340 are used, she is just as likely to color trees purple, hair green,
B10 1350 etc&>.   <The other children in the class use this same coloring
B10 1360 book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color. Should
B10 1370 I show my daughter how things should be colored? She is an aggressive,
B10 1380 nervous child. Is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help
B10 1390 her outgrow these traits?> _ANSWER_- Her choice of one color
B10 1400 means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring, without having
B10 1410 reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects.
B10 1420 This immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature
B10 1430 for the first grade.   No, coloring isn't exactly something
B10 1440 you teach a child. You sometimes give them a little demonstration,
B10 1450 a little guidance, and suggestions about staying inside the lines. But
B10 1460 most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only
B10 1470 a very little demonstration.
B10 1480    SEEN in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest
B10 1490 in an old art: embroidery. Possibly responsible for this is the incoming
B10 1500 trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms, which seems slated to
B10 1510 replace the one-color look to which we have been accustomed. Just as
B10 1520 a varitinted Oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme,
B10 1530 so may some of the newest versions of embroidery.   One such,
B10 1540 in fact, is a rug. Though not actually crewel embroidery, it has
B10 1550 that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue, pink, bronze
B10 1560 and gold and a sauterne background. The twirled, stylized design of
B10 1570 winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns
B10 1580 used so extensively for upholstery during the Jacobean period in
B10 1590 England.   Traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing
B10 1600 more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available
B10 1610 in this country. The work is executed in England (by hand) and
B10 1620 can be worked in any desired design and color.   Among some recent
B10 1630 imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on
B10 1640 which were depicted salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens
B10 1650 and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color.
B10 1660 #CHINESE INFLUENCE# For a particularly fabulous room which houses
B10 1670 a collection of fine English Chippendale furniture, fabric wall panels
B10 1680 were embroidered with a typically Chinese-inspired design of this
B10 1690 revered Eighteenth Century period. Since the work is done by hand,
B10 1700 the only limitation, it is said, "is that of human conception".
B10 1710    Modern embroidered panels, framed and meant to be hung on the
B10 1720 wall, are another aspect of this trend. These have never gone out of
B10 1730 style in Scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here and
B10 1740 there in shops which specialize in handicrafts. An amateur decorator
B10 1750 might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings, and, by
B10 1760 picking up her living room color scheme, add a decorative do-it-yourself
B10 1770 note to the room.
B11 0010    California Democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962
B11 0020 model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling
B11 0030 in a thousand district headquarters, party clubrooms and workers'
B11 0040 backyards.   They seem darned proud of it.   And they're
B11 0050 confident that the ~GOP, currently assailed by dissensions
B11 0060 within the ranks, will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood
B11 0070 of this grassroots-fueled machine. #@# Their meeting at San
B11 0080 Francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the California
B11 0090 Democratic Council directorate. But it will include 200-odd officeholders,
B11 0100 organization leaders and "interested party people".
B11 0110    Out of this session may come: _1_- Plans for a dramatic,
B11 0120 broad-scale party rally in Los Angeles next December that would enlist
B11 0130 top-drawer Democrats from all over the country. _2_- Blueprints
B11 0140 for doubling the ~CDC's present 55,000 enrollment. _3_-
B11 0150 Arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing convention in
B11 0160 Fresno next Jan& 26-28. _4_- And proposals for a whole series
B11 0170 of lesser candidate-picking conventions in the state's 38 new Congressional
B11 0180 districts.   At the head of the ~CDC is an unorthodox,
B11 0190 39-year-old amateur politico, Thomas B& Carvey Jr&,
B11 0200 whose normal profession is helping develop Hughes Aircraft's moon
B11 0210 missiles. He's approached his Democratic duties in hard-nosed engineering
B11 0220 fashion. #@# Viewed from afar, the ~CDC looks like
B11 0230 a rather stalwart political pyramid: its elected directorate fans out
B11 0240 into an array of district leaders and standing committees, and thence
B11 0250 into its component clubs and affiliated groups- 500 or so.
B11 0260 Much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every
B11 0270 "volunteer" Democratic organization of any consequence belongs to
B11 0280 the ~CDC. #@# Moreover, the entire state Democratic hierarchy,
B11 0290 from Gov& Brown on down to the county chairmen, also participates
B11 0300 in this huge operation.   Contrarily, Republican "volunteers"
B11 0310 go their separate ways, and thus far have given no indication
B11 0320 that they'd be willing to join forces under a single directorate,
B11 0330 except in the most loose-knit fashion.   Carvey believes that
B11 0340 reapportionment,
B11 0350 which left many Democratic clubs split by these new district
B11 0360 boundaries, actually will increase ~CDC membership. Where
B11 0370 only one club existed before, he says, two will flourish henceforth.
B11 0380    Biggest organizational problem, he adds, is setting up ~CDC
B11 0390 units in rock-ribbed Democratic territory. Paradoxically the council
B11 0400 is weakest in areas that register 4- and 5-to-1 in the party's
B11 0410 favor, strongest where Democrats and Republicans compete on a fairly
B11 0420 even basis.   Like most Democratic spokesmen, Carvey predicts
B11 0430 1962 will be a tremendously "partisan year". Hence the attention
B11 0440 they're lavishing on the ~CDC.   In all probability, the
B11 0450 council will screen and endorse candidates for the Assembly and for
B11 0460 Congress, and then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary
B11 0470 favorites. This bodes heated contests in several districts where
B11 0480 claims have already been staked out by Democratic hopefuls who don't
B11 0490 see eye-to-eye with the ~CDC.   Naturally, the statewide
B11 0500 races will provide the major test for the expanding council.   Shunted
B11 0510 aside by the rampant organizers for John F& Kennedy last
B11 0520 year, who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the Presidential
B11 0530 campaign, the ~CDC plainly intends to provide the party's
B11 0540 campaign muscle in 1962. There is evidence that it will be happily received
B11 0550 by Gov& Brown and the other constitutional incumbents. #@#
B11 0560 Carvey considers that former Vice President Nixon would be Brown's
B11 0570 most formidable foe, with ex-Gov& Knight a close second.
B11 0580 But the rest of the ~GOP gubernatorial aspirants don't worry
B11 0590 him very much.   In his ~CDC work, Carvey has the close-in
B11 0600 support and advice of one of California's shrewdest political strategists:
B11 0610 former Democratic National Committeeman Paul Ziffren,
B11 0620 who backed him over a Northland candidate espoused by Atty& Gen&
B11 0630 Stanley Mosk. (Significantly, bitter echoes of the 1960 power struggle
B11 0640 that saw Mosk moving into the national committee post over Ziffren
B11 0650 are still audible in party circles.) #@# NOTE: We've
B11 0660 just received an announcement of the 54th Assembly district post-reapportionment
B11 0670 organizing convention Wednesday night in South
B11 0680 Pasadena's War Memorial Bldg&, which graphically illustrates the
B11 0690 ~CDC's broad appeal. State Sen& Dick Richards will keynote;
B11 0700 state and county
B11 0710 committeemen, ~CDC directors and representatives,
B11 0720 members of 16 area clubs, and "all residents" have been invited.
B11 0740    This is going to be a language lesson, and you can master it in
B11 0750 a few minutes. It is a short course in Communese.   It works
B11 0760 with English, Russian, German, Hungarian or almost any other foreign
B11 0770 tongue. Once you learn how to translate Communese, much of each
B11 0780 day's deluge of news will become clearer. At least, I have found it
B11 0790 so. #@# For some compulsive reason which would have fascinated
B11 0800 Dr& Freud, Communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably
B11 0810 impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves. They
B11 0820 accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves
B11 0830 are most guilty.   President Kennedy's latest warning to the
B11 0840 Communist world that the United States will build up its military
B11 0850 strength to meet any challenge in Berlin or elsewhere was somewhat surprisingly,
B11 0860 reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the
B11 0870 Iron Curtain. Then the Communese reply came back from many mouthpieces
B11 0890 with striking consistency.   Now listen closely:
B11 0900 Moscow radio from the Literary Gazette in English to England:
B11 0910 #@# "President Kennedy once again interpreted the Soviet proposals,
B11 0920 to sign a peace treaty with Germany as a threat, as part of
B11 0930 the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism. Evidently
B11 0940 the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred
B11 0960 up in the West have been planned long in advance. The West Berlin
B11 0970 crisis is being played up artificially because it is needed by the
B11 0980 United States to justify its arms drive".   The Soviet news
B11 0990 agency ~TASS datelined from New York in English to Europe:
B11 1000    "President Kennedy's enlargement of the American military
B11 1010 program was welcomed on Wall Street as a stimulus to the American
B11 1020 munitions industry. When the stock exchange opened this morning,
B11 1030 many dealers were quick to purchase shares in Douglas, Lockheed and
B11 1040 United Aircraft and prices rose substantially. Over 4 million shares
B11 1050 were sold, the highest figures since early June. (Quotations follow".)
B11 1060    ~TASS datelined Los Angeles, in English to Europe:
B11 1070    "Former Vice President Nixon came out in support of
B11 1080 President Kennedy's program for stepping up the arms race. He also
B11 1090 demanded that Kennedy take additional measures to increase international
B11 1100 tension: specifically to crush the Cuban revolution, resume
B11 1110 nuclear testing, resist more vigorously admission of China to its lawful
B11 1120 seat in the United Nations, and postpone non-military programs at
B11 1130 home".   ~TASS from Moscow in English to Europe:
B11 1140    "The American press clamored for many days promising President
B11 1150 Kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic and foreign problems
B11 1160 confronting the United States. In fact, the world heard nothing
B11 1170 but sabre-rattling, the same exercises which proved futile for the
B11 1180 predecessors of the current President. If there were no West Berlin
B11 1190 problem, imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping
B11 1200 up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems
B11 1210 besetting the United States and its ~NATO partners. Washington
B11 1220 apparently decided to use an old formula, by injecting large
B11 1230 military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the U&S& economy
B11 1240 after a prolonged slump". #@# And now, for Communist
B11 1250 listeners and readers:   Moscow Radio in Russian to the ~USSR:
B11 1260    "The U&S& President has shown once again that
B11 1270 the United States needs the fanning of the West Berlin crisis
B11 1280 to justify the armaments race. As was to be expected Kennedy's latest
B11 1290 speech was greeted with enthusiasm by revenge-seeking circles in Bonn,
B11 1300 where officials of the West German government praised it".
B11 1310    Moscow Novosti article in Russian, datelined London:
B11 1320    "U&S& pressure on Britain to foster war hysteria over the status
B11 1330 of West Berlin has reached its apogee. British common sense is
B11 1340 proverbial. The present attempts of the politicians to contaminate
B11 1350 ordinary Britons shows that this British common sense is unwilling to
B11 1360 pull somebody else's chestnuts out of the fire by new military adventures".
B11 1370 #@# East Berlin (Communist) radio in German to Germany:
B11 1380    "A better position for negotiations is the real point
B11 1390 of this speech. Kennedy knows the West will not wage war for West
B11 1400 Berlin, neither conventional nor nuclear, and negotiations will come
B11 1410 as certainly as the peace treaty. Whenever some Washington circles
B11 1420 were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always
B11 1430 succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the Pentagon and in Bonn.
B11 1440 In Kennedy's speech are cross currents, sensible ones and senseless
B11 1450 ones, reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the President's
B11 1460 advisers and the political and economic forces behind them.
B11 1470 Well, dear listeners, despite all the shouting, there will be no war
B11 1480 over West Berlin".   Moscow ~TASS in Russian datelined
B11 1490 Sochi:   "Chairman Khrushchev received the U&S& President's
B11 1500 disarmament adviser, John McCloy. Their conversation
B11 1510 and dinner passed in a warm and friendly atmosphere".   Now,
B11 1520 to translate from the Communese, this means:   The "West Berlin"
B11 1530 crisis is really an East Berlin crisis. #@# The crisis
B11 1540 was artificially stirred up by the Kremlin (Wall Street) and the
B11 1550 Red Army (Pentagon) egged on by the West Germans (East Germans).
B11 1560    The reason was to speed up domestic production in the ~USSR,
B11 1570 which Khrushchev promised upon grabbing power, and try to end
B11 1580 the permanent recession in Russian living standards.   Chairman
B11 1590 Khrushchev (Kennedy) rattles his rockets (sabre) in order to cure
B11 1600 his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position. His advisers
B11 1610 in the Politburo (White House) are engaged in a great struggle
B11 1620 of opinions, so he is not always consistent.   The Soviet Union
B11 1630 will fight neither a conventional nor a nuclear war over Berlin,
B11 1640 and neither will its Warsaw Pact allies. The West has no intention
B11 1650 of attacking Russia.   Chairman Khrushchev and John McCloy
B11 1660 had a terrible row at Sochi.   See, Communese is easy- once
B11 1670 you get onto it.
B11 1680    Aug& 4, 1821, nearly a century after Benjamin Franklin founded
B11 1690 the Pennsylvania Gazette- a century during which it had undergone
B11 1700 several changes in ownership and a few brief suspensions in publication-
B11 1710 this paper made its first appearance as the Saturday Evening
B11 1720 Post. The country was now full of Gazettes and Samuel C& Atkinson
B11 1730 and Charles Alexander, who had just taken over Franklin's
B11 1740 old paper, desired a more distinctive name.   When founded by Franklin
B11 1750 the Gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name
B11 1760 its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually
B11 1770 contained more and more fiction, poetry, and literary essays. In the
B11 1780 middle of the century, with a circulation of 90,000, the Post was one
B11 1790 of the most popular weeklies in the country. But during the second half
B11 1800 of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 Cyrus
B11 1810 H& K& Curtis purchased it- "paper, type, and all"-
B11 1820 for $1,000 it was a 16-page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and
B11 1830 initialed miscellany, and with only some 2,000 subscribers.   Little
B11 1840 more than a fine old name, valuable principally because of the
B11 1850 Franklin tradition, the Saturday Evening Post was slow to revive.
B11 1860 But Curtis poured over $1 million into it and in time it again became
B11 1870 one of the most popular weeklies of the country.

B11 2020 anxious to hear about those dazzling days on the Great White Way. All

B12 0010    SING SING'S prisoner strike was motivated by a reasonable
B12 0020 purpose, a fair break from parole boards. But once the strike trend
B12 0030 hits hoosegows, there is no telling how far it may go. Inmates might
B12 0040 even demand the 34-hour week, all holidays off and fringe benefits including
B12 0050 state contributions toward lawyers' fees. Some day we might
B12 0060 see a Federation of Prison and Jail Inmates, with a leader busily
B12 0070 trying to organize reformatory occupants, defendants out on bail, convicts
B12 0080 opposed to probation officers, etc&. _@_ A three-day confinement
B12 0090 week, with a month's vacation and shorter hours all around
B12 0100 could be an ultimate demand from cell occupants of the nation, with
B12 0110 fringe benefits including: _1._ Wider space between iron bars
B12 0120 and agreement by prison boards to substitute rubber in 20 per cent of
B12 0130 metal. _2._ An agreement allowing convicts to pass on type of locks
B12 0140 used on prison doors. In case of a deadlock between prison boards
B12 0150 and inmates, a federal arbitration board to include a "lifer" and
B12 0160 two escapees should decide the issue. _3._ Specific broadening of
B12 0170 travel rights. _4._ The right to leave the hoosegow any time to
B12 0180 see a lawyer instead of waiting for a lawyer to make a trip to the prison.
B12 0190 _5._ Recognition of Prisoners Union rule that no member of
B12 0200 an iron or steel workers union be permitted to repair a sawed-off bar
B12 0210 without approval and participation of representative of the cell occupant.
B12 0220 _6._ No warden or guard to touch lock, key or doorknob except
B12 0230 when accompanied by a prisoners' committee with powers of veto.
B12 0240 _7._ State and federal approval of right to walk out at any time
B12 0250 when so voted by 51 per cent of the prisoners. #@# The death of
B12 0260 Harold A& Stevens, oldest of the Stevens brothers, famed operators

B12 0290 with brothers Frank, Joe and William, took over at the death of their
B12 0300 father, Harry M& Stevens, who put a few dollars into a baseball

B12 0500 _WASHINGTON_- Rep& Frelinghuysen, ~R-5th Dist&, had a
B12 0510 special reason for attending the reception at the Korean Embassy for
B12 0520 Gen& Chung Hee Park, the new leader of South Korea.   Not
B12 0530 only is Mr& Frelinghuysen a member of the House Foreign Affairs
B12 0540 Committee, but he is the grandson of the man who was instrumental
B12 0550 in opening relations between the United States and Korea, Frederick
B12 0560 T& Frelinghuysen, secretary of state in the administration of Chester
B12 0570 A& Arthur. In addition Rep& Frelinghuysen's brother

B12 0590 /2,.   Next year is the 80th anniversary of the signing of
B12 0600 the treaty between Korea and the United States and experts in Seoul

B12 0620 who was secretary of state in 1883 and 1884, and Gen& Lucius
B12 0630 Foote, who was the first minister to Korea.   They enlisted the
B12 0640 help of the New Jersey congressman, who has been able to trace the

B12 0690 96 conferences, attended 35 official breakfasts and dinners, studied
B12 0700 and signed 285 official papers and personally took 312 telephone calls.
B12 0710    In addition, he said, he has answered more than 400 messages
B12 0720 of congratulations which led him to the comment that he himself had decided
B12 0730 he wouldn't send another congratulatory message for the rest
B12 0740 of his life. _@_ Sen& Case ~R-N&J&, has received a
B12 0750 nice "thank you" note from a youngster he appointed to the Air Force

B12 0770 wrote, "though the fourth-class system is no fun". He invited Mr&
B12 0780 Case to stop by to say hello if he ever visited the academy and
B12 0790 then added that he was on the managerial staff of the freshman football
B12 0800 team   "We have just returned from Roswell, N&M&, where
B12 0810 we were defeated, 34 to 9", the young man noted. "We have a

B12 0830 SAM# Among the many stories about the late Speaker Rayburn is
B12 0840 one from Rep& Dwyer, ~R-6th Dist&. Mrs& Dwyer's husband,
B12 0850 M& Joseph Dwyer, was taking a 10-year-old boy from Union County
B12 0860 on the tour of the Capitol during the final weeks of the last session.
B12 0870 They ran across Mr& Rayburn and the youngster expressed a
B12 0880 desire to get the Speaker's autograph.   Mr& Dwyer said that
B12 0890 although it was obvious that Mr& Rayburn was not well he stopped,
B12 0900 gave the youngster his autograph, asked where he was from and expressed
B12 0910 the hope that he would enjoy his visit to Congress.   Two
B12 0920 days later Mr& Rayburn left Washington for the last time.
B12 0930    THE 350th anniversary of the King James Bible is being
B12 0940 celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the New Testament,
B12 0950 the first part of the New English Bible, undertaken as a new
B12 0960 translation of the Scriptures into contemporary English.   Since
B12 0970 it was issued in the spring of 1611, the King James Version has
B12 0980 been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations
B12 0990 of the Bible. However, Biblical scholars frequently attested
B12 1000 to its numerous inaccuracies, as old manuscripts were uncovered
B12 1010 and scholarship advanced.   This resulted in revisions of the King
B12 1020 James Bible in 1881-85 as the English Revised Version and in
B12 1030 1901 as the American Standard Version. Then in 1937 America's
B12 1040 International Council of Religious Education authorized a new revision,
B12 1050 in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages.
B12 1060 Undertaken by 32 American scholars, under the chairmanship
B12 1070 of Rev& Dr& Luther A& Weigle, former dean of Yale University
B12 1080 Divinity School, their studies resulted in the publishing of the
B12 1090 Revised Standard Version, 1946-52. #NOT RIVAL# The New English
B12 1100 Bible (the Old Testament and Apocrypha will be published at a
B12 1110 future date) has not been planned to rival or replace the King James
B12 1120 Version, but, as its cover states, it is offered "simply as the Bible
B12 1130 to all those who will use it in reading, teaching, or worship".
B12 1140    Time, of course will testify whether the new version will have
B12 1150 achieved its purpose. Bible reading, even more so than good classical
B12 1160 music, grows in depth and meaning upon repetition.   If this
B12 1170 new Bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout
B12 1180 the years, it will not survive the ages as has the King James
B12 1190 Version.   However, an initial perusal and comparison of some
B12 1200 of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to
B12 1210 speak well of the efforts of the British Biblical scholars. One is
B12 1220 impressed with the dignity, clarity and beauty of this new translation
B12 1230 into contemporary English, and there is no doubt that the meaning of
B12 1240 the Bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary
B12 1250 language than in the frequently
B12 1260 archaic words and phrases of the
B12 1270 King James.   For example, in the third chapter of Matthew, verses
B12 1280 13-16, describing the baptism of Jesus, the 1611 version reads:
B12 1290    "Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John,
B12 1300 to be baptized of him.   "But John forbad him, saying, I have
B12 1310 need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?   "And
B12 1320 Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it
B12 1330 becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him.
B12 1340    "And Jesus, when he was baptized went up straightway out of the
B12 1350 water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit
B12 1360 of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him". #CLEARER
B12 1370 MEANING# Certainly, the meaning is clearer to one who is not
B12 1380 familiar with Biblical teachings, in the New English Bible which reads:
B12 1390 "Then Jesus arrived at Jordan from Galilee, and he came
B12 1400 to John to be baptized by him. John tried to dissuade him. 'Do you
B12 1410 come to me'? he said; 'I need rather to be baptized by you'.
B12 1420 Jesus replied, 'let it be so for the present; we do well to
B12 1430 conform this way with all that God requires'. John then allowed him
B12 1440 to come. After baptism Jesus came up out of the water at once, and
B12 1450 at that moment heaven opened; he saw the Spirit of God descending
B12 1460 like a dove to alight upon him";   (the paragraphing, spelling
B12 1470 and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version.)
B12 1480 Among the most frequently quoted Biblical sentences are the Beatitudes
B12 1490 and yet so few persons, other than scholars, really understand the
B12 1500 true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by Jesus at the beginning
B12 1510 of the Sermon on the Mount.   To illustrate, the first blessing
B12 1520 in the King James Bible reads: "Blessed are the poor in
B12 1530 spirit; for their's is the kingdom of heaven". The new version
B12 1540 states: "How blest are those who know that they are poor; the
B12 1550 kingdom of Heaven is theirs".   Some of the poetic cadence of
B12 1560 the older version certainly is lost in the newer one, but almost anyone,
B12 1570 with a fair knowledge of the English language, can understand the
B12 1580 meaning, without the necessity of interpretation by a Biblical scholar.
B12 1590 To a novice
B12 1600 that is significant.   In the second and third
B12 1610 chapters of Revelation the new version retains, however, the old phrase
B12 1620 "angel of the church" which Biblical scholars have previously
B12 1630 interpreted as meaning bishop. This is not contemporary English. #MOSTLY
B12 1640 CONTEMPORARY# For the most part, however, the new version is
B12 1650 contemporary and, as such, should be the means for many to attain a
B12 1660 clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds
B12 1670 of years ago by the first followers of Christ.   Originally
B12 1680 recorded by hand, these words have been copied and recopied, translated
B12 1690 and retranslated through the ages. Discoveries recently made of
B12 1700 old Biblical manuscripts in Hebrew and Greek and other ancient writings,
B12 1710 some by the early church fathers, in themselves called for a restudy
B12 1720 of the Bible. To have the results recorded in everyday usable
B12 1730 English should be of benefit to all who seek the truth.   There
B12 1740 is one danger, however. With contemporary English changing with the
B12 1750 rapidity that marks this jet age, some of the words and phrases of the
B12 1760 new version may themselves soon become archaic. The only answer will
B12 1770 be continuous study.   The New Testament offered to the public
B12 1780 today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made up
B12 1790 of representatives of the Church of England, Church of Scotland,
B12 1800 Methodist Church, Congregational Union, Baptist Union, Presbyterian
B12 1810 Church of England, Churches in Wales, Churches in Ireland,
B12 1820 Society of Friends, British and Foreign Bible Society and National
B12 1830 Society of Scotland.   Prof& C& H& Dodd, 76, a Congregational
B12 1840 minister and a leading authority on the New Testament,
B12 1850 is general director of the project and chairman of the New Testament
B12 1860 panel.
B13 0010    Sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but
B13 0020 kind to the feet. That is why it is important to invest in comfortable,
B13 0030 airy types of shoes.   There are many soft and light shoe
B13 0040 leathers available. Many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness
B13 0050 achieved via unlined leathers. Softness is found in crushed
B13 0060 textures.   Styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with
B13 0070 elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape. Heels place emphasis on
B13 0080 the
B13 0090 long legged silhouette. Wine glass heels are to be found in both high
B13 0100 and semi-heights. Stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored
B13 0110 shoes. Just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage
B13 0120 pumps. #COOLEST SHADE# While white is the coolest summer shade,
B13 0130 there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend
B13 0140 with any wardrobe color.   In the tintable group are high and
B13 0150 little heels, squared and oval throats, and shantung-like textures.
B13 0160    Don't overlook the straws this year. They come in crisp basket
B13 0170 weaves in natural honey hues, along with lacey open weaves with a
B13 0180 lustre finish in natural, white, black and a whole range of colors. In
B13 0190 the casual field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved wood in
B13 0200 a variety of styles. For added comfort some of the Italian designed
B13 0210 sandals have foam padded cushioning.   The citrus tones popular
B13 0220 in clothing are also to be found afoot. Orange and lemon are considered
B13 0230 important as are such pastels as blue and lilac. In a brighter nautical
B13 0240 vein is Ille de France blue. Contrast trim provides other touches
B13 0250 of color. Spectators in white crush textures dip toe and heel
B13 0260 in smooth black, navy and taffy tan. #DESIGNED FOR EASE# Designed
B13 0270 for summer comfort are the shoes illustrated. At the left is a pair
B13 0280 of dressy straw pumps in a light, but crisp texture. In a lacey open
B13 0290 weave shoes have a luster finish, braided collar and bow highlight on
B13 0300 the squared throat. At right is a casual style in a crushed unlined
B13 0310 white leather. Flats have a scalloped throat.
B13 0320    An electric toothbrush (Broxodent) may soon take its place next
B13 0330 to the electric razor in the American bathroom. The brush moves up
B13 0340 and down and is small enough to clean every dental surface, including
B13 0350 the back of the teeth. In addition, the motor has the seal of approval
B13 0360 of the Underwriters Laboratories, which means it is safe.
B13 0370 The unit consists of a small motor that goes on as soon as it is plugged
B13 0380 in. The speed is controlled by pressing on the two brake buttons
B13 0390 located where the index finger and thumb are placed when holding the
B13 0400 motor. The bushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable
B13 0410 so that every member of the family can have his own.
B13 0420 Most of us brush our teeth by hand. The same can be said of shaving
B13 0430 yet the electric razor has proved useful to many men.   The electric
B13 0440 toothbrush moves in a vertical direction, the way dentists recommend.
B13 0450 In addition, it is small enough to get into crevices, jacket and
B13 0460 crown margins, malposed anteriors, and the back teeth. The bristles
B13 0470 are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel.
B13 0480    It is conceivable that Broxodent could do a better job than ordinary
B13 0490 bushing, especially in those who do not brush their teeth properly.
B13 0500 Several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented
B13 0510 with the device. The results were good although they are difficult
B13 0520 to compare with hand brushing, particularly when the individual
B13 0530 knows how to brush his teeth properly. The electric gadget is most helpful
B13 0540 when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly,
B13 0550 bedfast with a chronic disease, or are handicapped by disorders
B13 0560 such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy.   But for many of
B13 0570 us, it will prove an enjoyable luxury. It is not as convenient as the
B13 0580 old type toothbrush and the paste tends to shimmy of the bristles. Since
B13 0590 the apparatus is new, it requires experimentation and changes in
B13 0600 technique. #TURN OVER# @ writes: Does numbness in the left
B13 0610 hand at night, which awakens the person, indicate brain tumor? _REPLY_
B13 0620 No. This is a common symptom and the cause usually is pressure
B13 0630 on the nerve leading to the affected hand. The pressure may come from
B13 0640 muscles, tendons, or bones anywhere from the neck to the hand. #STEAM
B13 0650 BATHS# @ writes: Do steam baths have any health value?
B13 0660 _REPLY_ No, other than cleaning out the pores and making the sweat
B13 0670 glands work harder. An ordinary hot bath or shower will do the same.
B13 0680 #SEWING BRINGS NUMBNESS# @ writes: What makes my hands numb
B13 0690 when sewing? _REPLY_ There are many possibilities, including
B13 0700 poor circulation, a variety of neurological conditions, and functional
B13 0710 disorders. This manifestation may be an early sign of multiple sclerosis
B13 0720 or the beginning of sewer's cramp. #BRACE FOR SCIATICA# @
B13 0730 writes: Does a brace help in sciatica? _REPLY_ A back brace
B13 0740 might help, depending upon the cause of sciatica. #CHOLESTEROL AND
B13 0750 THYROID# @ writes: Does the cholesterol go down when most of
B13 0760 the thyroid gland is removed? _REPLY_ No. It usually goes up.
B13 0770 The cholesterol level in the blood is influenced by the glands of the
B13 0780 body. It is low when the thyroid is overactive and high when the gland
B13 0790 is sluggish. The latter is likely to occur when the thyroid is removed.
B13 0810    The gap between the bookshelf and the record cabinet grows smaller
B13 0820 with each new recording catalogue.   There's more reading
B13 0830 and instruction to be heard on discs than ever before, although the spoken
B13 0840 rather than the sung word is as old as Thomas Alva Edison's
B13 0850 first experiment in recorded sound. Edison could hardly have guessed,
B13 0860 however, that Sophocles would one day appear in stereo.   If
B13 0870 the record buyer's tastes are somewhat eclectic or even the slightest
B13 0880 bit esoteric, he will find them satisfied on educational records. And
B13 0890 he will avoid eye-strain in the process.   Everything from poetry
B13 0900 to phonetics, history to histrionics, philosophy to party games
B13 0910 has been adapted to the turntable.   For sheer ambition, take the
B13 0920 Decca series titled modestly "Wisdom". Volumes One and Two,
B13 0930 selected from the sound tracks of a television series, contain "conversations
B13 0940 with the elder wise men of our day".   These sages
B13 0950 include poet Carl Sandburg, statesman Jawaharlal Nehru and sculptor
B13 0960 Jacques Lipchitz, in Volume One, and playwright Sean O'Casey,
B13 0970 David Ben-Gurion, philosopher Bertrand Russell and the late Frank
B13 0980 Lloyd Wright in the second set. Hugh Downs is heard interviewing
B13 0990 Wright, for an added prestige fillip.   There's more specialization
B13 1000 and a narrower purpose in two albums recently issued by Dover
B13 1010 Publications. Dover "publishes" what the company calls "Listen
B13 1020 and Learn" productions designed to teach foreign languages.
B13 1030 Previous presentations have been on French, Spanish, Russian, Italian,
B13 1040 German and Japanese.   But the firm has recognized the tight
B13 1050 dollar and the tourist's desire to visit the "smaller, less-traveled
B13 1060 and relatively inexpensive countries", and is now prepared to
B13 1070 teach modern Greek and Portuguese through recordings. The respective
B13 1080 vocabularies "essential for travel" are available in separate
B13 1090 albums.   Thanks to Spoken Arts Records, history buffs may hear
B13 1100 Lincoln's "most memorable speeches and letters" in a two-disc
B13 1110 set, interpreted by Lincoln authority and lecturer Roy P& Basler.
B13 1120 As a comtemporary bonus, the set includes Carl Sandburg's address
B13 1130 at a joint session of Congress, delivered on Lincoln's birthday
B13 1140 two years ago.   For those who "like poetry but never get
B13 1150 around to reading it", the Library of Congress makes it possible
B13 1160 for poets to be heard reading their own work. The program was instituted
B13 1170 in 1940, and releases are available only from the Recording Laboratory
B13 1180 of the Library of Congress, Washington 25, D& C& A catalogue
B13 1190 is available on request.   Newest on the list are John
B13 1200 Ciardi, W& D& Snodgrass, I& A& Richards, Oscar Williams,
B13 1210 Robert Hillyer, John Hall Wheelock, Stephen Vincent Benet,
B13 1220 Edwin Muir, John Peal Bishop and Maxwell Bodenheim. Two poets
B13 1230 are paired on each record, in the order given above.   Decca is
B13 1240 not the only large commercial company to impart instruction. ~RCA
B13 1250 Victor has an ambitious and useful project in a stereo series called
B13 1260 "Adventures in Music", which is an instructional record library
B13 1270 for elementary schools. Howard Mitchell and the National Symphony
B13 1280 perform in the first two releases, designed for grades one and two. Teaching
B13 1290 guides are included with each record.
B13 1300    In an effort to fortify himself against the unforseen upsets sure
B13 1310 to arise in the future, Herbert A& Leggett, banker-editor of
B13 1320 the Phoenix "Arizona Progress", reflects upon a few of the depressing
B13 1330 experiences of the feverish fifties.   One of the roughest
B13 1335 was the
B13 1340 ~TV quiz shows, which gave him inferiority complexes. Though
B13 1350 it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out
B13 1360 to be frauds and phonies, it did irreparable damage to the ego of the
B13 1370 editor and many another intelligent, well-informed American.
B13 1380 But the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer
B13 1390 who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a $2,000,000
B13 1400 profit on the stock market. Every man who dabbles in the market to
B13 1410 make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses could at the time
B13 1420 hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so
B13 1430 dumb. Investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic
B13 1440 dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best seller book
B13 1450 to make some dough.   People who take us for suckers are like
B13 1460 the Westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form
B13 1470 of a number of bull's-eye achievements. The promoter who wanted
B13 1480 to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it. His
B13 1490 answer was simple but honest. He just shot at the board and then drew
B13 1500 circles around the holes to form a bull's-eye.
B13 1510    One of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2-year-old child
B13 1520 is a lack of verbal communication. The child understands no. He senses
B13 1530 his mother's disapproval. But explanations leave him confused and
B13 1540 unmoved.   If his mother loves him, he clings to that love as
B13 1550 a ballast. It motivates his behavior. He wants Mommy to think him
B13 1560 a good boy. He doesn't want her to look frowningly at him, or speak
B13 1570 to him angrily. This breaks his heart. He wants to be called sweet,
B13 1580 good, considerate and mother's little helper. But even mother's
B13 1590 loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior.   His desires
B13 1600 are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother's
B13 1610 love for him and what she expects of him, in order to overcome them.
B13 1620 His own inner voice, which should tell him what not to do, has not developed.
B13 1630 It won't develop until he has words with which to clothe it.
B13 1640 The conscience is non-existent in the 2-year-old.   What can
B13 1650 a mother do then to prevent misbehavior? She can decrease the number
B13 1660 of temptations. She can remove all knick-knacks within reach. The
B13 1670 fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be.   She
B13 1680 should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly
B13 1690 desirable to the child. If he can't play with Mommy's magazines,
B13 1700 he should have some old numbers of his own. If Daddy's books
B13 1710 are out of bounds his own picture books are not. Toys he has can be
B13 1720 made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator
B13 1730 and gas stove.   During this precarious period of development the
B13 1740 mother should continue to influence the growth of the child's conscience.
B13 1750 She tells him of the consequences of his behavior. If he bites
B13 1760 a playmate she says, "Danny won't like you". If he snatches
B13 1770 a toy, she says, "Caroline wants her own truck just as you do".
B13 1780    There is no use trying to "Explain" to a 2-year-old. Actions
B13 1790 speak louder. Remove temptations. Remove the child from the scene
B13 1800 of his misbehavior. Substitute approved objects for forbidden ones
B13 1810 and keep telling him how he is to act. He won't submit to his natural
B13 1820 desires all the time, and it's Mother's love that is responsible
B13 1830 for his good behavior.
B14 0010    This is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities
B14 0020 and colleges schedule what they call "Homecoming Day".
B14 0030 They seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes.
B14 0040    The football opponent on homecoming is, of course, selected with
B14 0050 the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a Christian
B14 0060 when thrown to one of the emperor's lions. It is true, of
B14 0070 course, the uncertainties of life being what they are, that as now and
B14 0080 then the Christian killed the lion, homecoming days have been ruined
B14 0090 by a visiting team.   Even with all possible precaution, homecomings
B14 0100 are usually rather cruel and sad, and only the perpetually ebullient
B14 0110 and the continually optimistic are made happy by them.   More
B14 0120 often than not, as the Old Grad wanders along the old paths, his
B14 0130 memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside
B14 0140 him becomes an ache and a pain. He can smell again the perfume she
B14 0150 wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter, and can smell again the
B14 0160 aroma of autumn- fallen leaves, the wine of cool air, and the nostalgia
B14 0170 of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall. #UNDERGRADUATES#
B14 0180 It is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple
B14 0190 of undergraduates, faces alight, holding hands and talking happily
B14 0200 as they come along, oblivious of him, or throwing him the most fleeting
B14 0210 and casual of glances, such as they would give a tethered goat. Usually,
B14 0220 they titter loudly after they have passed by.   His dream
B14 0230 goes. He feels, suddenly, the weight of the fat that is on him. His
B14 0240 bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous. His bifocals blur.
B14 0250 His legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary, as if he had
B14 0260 walked for miles, instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the
B14 0270 old campus paths. Bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is
B14 0280 like unripe persimmons in his mouth.   It is not much better if
B14 0290 he meets with old classmates. Too often, unless he hails them, they
B14 0300 pass him by. He recalls with a wry smile the wit who said, on returning
B14 0310 from a homecoming reunion, that he would never go again because all
B14 0320 his class had changed so much they didn't even recognize him.
B14 0330    If they do meet and recognize one another, slap backs and embrace,
B14 0340 the moment soon is done. After all, when one has asked whatever became
B14 0350 of old Joe and Charlie **h when one has inquired who it was Sue
B14 0360 Brown married and where it is they now live **h when questions are asked
B14 0370 and answered about families and children, and old professors **h when
B14 0380 the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted **h that does
B14 0390 it. #MIDDLE-AGED SPREAD# By then one begins to notice the middle-age
B14 0400 spread; the gray hairs, the eyeglasses, bodies that are too thin
B14 0410 or too heavy; the fading signs of old beauty; the athlete of by-gone
B14 0415 years who wears a size 46 suit and puffs
B14 0420 when he has finished a sentence
B14 0430 of any length **h then, it is time to break it up and move on.
B14 0440    It is, if anything, worse on the old player **h   He sits
B14 0450 in the stands and he doesn't like that. Enough of his life was spent
B14 0460 there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator
B14 0470 in the crowd. He always feels lonely. A team feels something.
B14 0480 On a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next
B14 0490 to him. In the stands he is lonely and lost, no matter how many are about
B14 0500 him.   He sits there remembering the tense moment before the
B14 0510 ball was snapped; the churning of straining feet, the rasp of the
B14 0520 canvas pants; the smell and feel of hot, wet woolen sleeves across his
B14 0530 face. He remembers the desperate, panting breath; the long runs
B14 0540 on the kick-offs; the hard, jolting tackles; the breakthrough; the
B14 0550 desperate agony of goal-line stands. And so, he squirms with each
B14 0560 play, remembering his youth.   But it is no use. It is gone.
B14 0570    No matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and
B14 0580 strength, they can never be recaptured again.
B14 0590    Since the obvious is not always true, the Republican National
B14 0600 Committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that
B14 0610 it occurred, as suspected, in the larger cities.   Of 40 cities
B14 0620 with populations of 300,000 and more, Mr& Kennedy carried 26 and Mr&
B14 0630 Nixon 14. There are eight states in which the largest urban vote
B14 0640 can be the balance of power in any close election. These are New
B14 0650 York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Illinois
B14 0660 and Minnesota. In 1952 Mr& Eisenhower won all but Missouri.
B14 0670 Yet, in 1960 all eight gave majorities to Mr& Kennedy.
B14 0680    Republican research broke down the vote in Philadelphia. Mr& Nixon,
B14 0690 despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups, failed
B14 0700 to do so. His visit to Warsaw, Poland, after the Russian journey
B14 0710 in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the Polish vote which,
B14 0720 in several cities, is substantial. Yet, the ~GOP breakdown discovered
B14 0730 that in Philadelphia Mr& Nixon received but 21 per cent of
B14 0740 the so-called "Polish" vote; 30 per cent of the "Irish" vote,
B14 0750 and 18 per cent of the "Negro" vote. #'TASK FORCE'#
B14 0760 A ~GOP "task force' committee will seek to find out how its
B14 0770 party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities.
B14 0780    The task force might make a start in Washington with Republican
B14 0790 congressional leaders. These gentlemen already have done the party
B14 0800 harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas
B14 0810 and by their criticism of Mr& Kennedy for talking about a recession
B14 0820 and unemployment. This error was compounded by declaring the recession
B14 0830 to be "a statistical one", and not a reality. The almost six
B14 0840 million persons without jobs and the two million working part-time do
B14 0850 not consider themselves and their plight as statistical. They did not
B14 0860 view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by Secretary of Labor
B14 0870 Goldberg as politics, which the ~GOP declared it to be. The
B14 0880 people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take
B14 0890 an interest in their misery.   Senator Mundt's gross distortion
B14 0900 of President Eisenhower's conversation into a denunciation
B14 0910 of President Kennedy as too left wing, a statement Mr& Eisenhower
B14 0920 declared to be entirely false, is another case in point. If the Republicans
B14 0930 and Southern Democrats join to defeat medical care for the
B14 0940 old under the Social Security program, they will thereby erect still
B14 0950 another barrier to ~GOP hopes in the cities. #ERRORS REPEATED#
B14 0960 The present Republican leadership as practiced by Mundt, Goldwater,
B14 0970 Bridges, Dirksen, et al, is repeating the errors of the party
B14 0980 leadership of the 1930s. In that decade the partisan zeal to defend Mr&
B14 0990 Hoover, and the party's failure to anticipate or cope with the
B14 1000 depression, caused a great majority of Americans to see the Republican
B14 1010 party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human
B14 1020 beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic
B14 1030 crash.   The Republican party was not lacking in humanity,
B14 1040 but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear
B14 1050 devoid of any consideration for people in trouble. Farmers called their
B14 1060 mule-drawn pickup trucks "Hoover carts". Smokers reduced to
B14 1070 "the makings", spoke of the sack tobacco as "Hoover dust".
B14 1080    One may be sure the present Republican congressional leadership
B14 1090 hasn't meant to repeat this error. But it is in the process of so
B14 1100 doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade John
B14 1110 F& Kennedy. That this is not good politics is underscored by the
B14 1120 latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of the people like
B14 1130 the way in which the new President is conducting the nation's business.
B14 1140    The most articulate Republicans are those who, in their
B14 1150 desire to get back at Mr& Kennedy, already have created the image
B14 1160 of a Republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed
B14 1170 and the unemployed, and which is even more unwilling to help old people
B14 1180 who need medical care. If they also defeat the school bill, the
B14 1190 ~GOP task force won't have much research to do. It will early
B14 1200 know why the party won't win back city votes.
B14 1210    The 1962 General Assembly has important business to consider.
B14 1220 The tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in
B14 1230 any responsible manner.   After the Griffin-Byrd political troup
B14 1240 has completed the circuit in November in the name of a Pre-Legislative
B14 1250 Forum, this is going to be the most politically oriented Legislature
B14 1260 in history.   Every legislator from Brasstown Bald to
B14 1270 Folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny
B14 1280 as a test of his political allegiances, not his convictions.
B14 1290    Hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system
B14 1300 stands less chance than ever. And just how far can the Legislature
B14 1310 go toward setting up a self-insurance system for the state in the
B14 1320 midst of a governor's race"?   How unpartisan will be the
B14 1325 recommendations
B14 1330 of Lt& Gov& Garland Byrd's Senate Committee
B14 1340 on Government Operations?   The situation already was bad because
B14 1350 the Legislature moved the governor's race forward a few months,
B14 1360 causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual.   But
B14 1370 when former Gov& Marvin Griffin and Lt& Gov& Byrd accepted
B14 1380 the invitations of the Georgia State Chamber of Commerce to join
B14 1390 the tour next November, the situation was aggravated.   Neither
B14 1400 had a choice other than to accept the invitation. To have refused
B14 1410 would have been political suicide. And it may be that one or both men
B14 1420 actually welcomed the opportunity, when the bravado comments are cast
B14 1430 aside.   The Georgia State Chamber of Commerce tried to guard
B14 1440 against the danger of eliminating potential candidates. It wanted
B14 1450 the State Democratic Executive Committee to pick the "serious
B14 1460 candidates".   But State Party Chairman James Gray of Albany
B14 1470 said no, and he didn't mince any words. "They are just asking
B14 1480 too much", he said. We can't think of anyone else who would want
B14 1490 to separate serious candidates from other candidates, either.
B14 1500    There are other dangers:   Politics is an accelerating game.
B14 1510 "If an opponent accuses you of lying, don't deny it. Say he is
B14 1520 a horse thief", runs an old adage.   These men are spenders.
B14 1530 If either one ever started making promises, there is no telling where
B14 1540 the promises would end. Griffin's Rural Roads Authority and Byrd's
B14 1550 60,000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper's oaths.
B14 1560    The trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such
B14 1570 a good one. Why not have them travel the state in November debating?
B14 1580 It would present a forum for them in almost every community.
B14 1590    But further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governor's
B14 1600 race being run in the next Legislature, the spectre of big spending
B14 1610 programs, the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin.
B14 1620 There isa way out of this. The Chamber has not arranged a pre-legislative
B14 1630 forum. It has arranged a campaign for governor.   If
B14 1640 it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed
B14 1650 next spring, and then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates,
B14 1660 it can provide a service to the state.   But the Legislature should
B14 1670 be granted the opportunity to compelte its work before choosing
B14 1680 up sides for the race.
B14 1690    Former British Prime Minister Attlee says Eisenhower was
B14 1700 not a
B14 1710 "great soldier". Ike's somewhat like George Washington.
B14 1720 Both won a pretty fair-sized war with a modest assist from British strategy.
B14 1730    Congressmen returning from recess say the people admire
B14 1740 President Kennedy so much, they're even willing to heed his call
B14 1750 to sacrifice- and give up his program.   Slogan of the John
B14 1760 Birch Society: "Paddle your own canoe. The guy who makes the
B14 1770 motor boats may be a Communist".   A Republican survey says
B14 1775 Kennedy
B14 1780 won the '60 election on the religious issue. Too many people were
B14 1790 afraid if the ~GOP won, they'd have to spend all their time praying.
B15 0010    The Providence Journal editorial (Jan& 25) entitled "East
B15 0020 Greenwich Faces a Housing Development Problem" points to a
B15 0030 dilemma that faces communities such as ours. Your suggested solution,
B15 0040 it seems to me, is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your
B15 0050 generally realistic attitude toward, and endorsement of, sound planning.
B15 0060    First of all there is ample area in East Greenwich already
B15 0070 zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested.
B15 0080 This land is in various stages of development in several locations
B15 0090 throughout the town. The demand for these lots can be met for some
B15 0100 time to come. This would seem to indicate that we are trying neither
B15 0110 "to halt an influx of migrants" nor are we "setting up such standards
B15 0120 for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy
B15 0130 land and build in the new sites".   What we are attempting to
B15 0140 do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density
B15 0150 residential areas and industrial and commercial development. It
B15 0160 is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial
B15 0170 development to help pay governmental costs. Bostitch, Inc& is
B15 0180 approximately half way through a 10-year exemption of their real estate
B15 0190 tax. The wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter,
B15 0200 but this particular instance is, in my opinion, completely satisfactory.
B15 0210 The 1960 tax book for East Greenwich indicates a valuation for this
B15 0220 property in excess of two million dollars. With our current $3 per
B15 0230 hundred tax rate, it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you
B15 0240 suggest a community should "try to develop a modest industrial plant"
B15 0250 as the best way to meet these problems.   In order to attract
B15 0260 additional industry that is compatible with this community it is
B15 0270 all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly
B15 0280 balance in the tax structure. As this tax base grows so then can your
B15 0290 medium and low density residential areas grow. Mr& Richard Preston,
B15 0300 executive director of the New Hampshire State Planning and
B15 0310 Development Commission, in his remarks to the Governors Conference
B15 0320 on Industrial Development at Providence on October 8, 1960, warned
B15 0330 against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce
B15 0340 the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when
B15 0350 he said: "If this is the fundamental reason for a community's
B15 0360 interest or if this is the basic approach, success if any will be difficult
B15 0370 to obtain". He went on to say: "In the first place, industry
B15 0380 per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities.
B15 0390 It is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased
B15 0400 municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be".
B15 0410    While Councilman Olson cited the anticipated increase in school
B15 0420 costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer, the impact upon
B15 0430 a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes
B15 0440 to find alarm in uncontrolled growth. We in East Greenwich have the
B15 0450 example of two neighboring communities, one currently utilizing double
B15 0460 sessions in their schools, and the other facing this prospect next year.
B15 0470 It has already been reported in your newspapers that the East Greenwich
B15 0480 School Committee is considering additions to at least one
B15 0490 elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations
B15 0500 for a school population that we know will increase. If they are to
B15 0510 be commended for foresight in their planning, what then is the judgment
B15 0520 of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage?
B15 0530 Where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies
B15 0540 within the community that you have called for in other editorials?
B15 0550 I submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not
B15 0560 facing the facts of life.   The "fruitful course" of metropolitanization
B15 0570 that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of
B15 0580 East Greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it
B15 0590 was called. For example: _1._ The East Greenwich Police Department
B15 0600 utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the Warwick Police
B15 0610 Department, thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and
B15 0620 ensuring police coordination in the Cowessett-East Greenwich-Potowomut
B15 0630 area of the two communities. _2._ The East Greenwich
B15 0640 Fire District services parts of Warwick as well as East Greenwich.
B15 0650 _3._ The taxpayers of East Greenwich appropriate sums of money,
B15 0660 as do other Kent County communities, for the support of the Kent
B15 0670 County Memorial Hospital, a regional facility. _4._ The East
B15 0680 Greenwich Free Library receives financial support from the town of
B15 0690 East Greenwich and the City of Warwick to supplement its endowment.
B15 0700 _5._ Feelers were put out last year to the City of Warwick,
B15 0710 as reported in your newspapers, suggesting investigation of a common rubbish
B15 0720 disposal area to service the Potowomut and Cowessett areas of
B15 0730 Warwick along with East Greenwich. _6._ East Greenwich was one
B15 0740 of the first Rhode Island towns to enter into contract agreement with
B15 0750 the Rhode Island Development Council for planning services we
B15 0760 could not provide for ourselves. _7._ The education program for retarded
B15 0770 children conducted by the East Greenwich school system has pupils
B15 0780 from at least one neighboring community.   I feel compelled
B15 0790 to write this because I am greatly concerned with the problem of community
B15 0800 growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town
B15 0810 such as East Greenwich. I believe it is an area in which professional
B15 0820 planners have failed to set adequate guide posts; and yet they cannot
B15 0830 ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly
B15 0840 all the planning programs they have devised. These programs are
B15 0850 volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must
B15 0860 stand aside while land developers tell them when, where, and in what
B15 0870 manner the community shall grow. We have far less to fear in the migrant
B15 0880 family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions.
B15 0890    Until professional planners meet this situation squarely
B15 0900 and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts,
B15 0910 I hope we in East Greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny.

B15 0930    I would like very much, on behalf of my husband and myself, to
B15 0940 send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the
B15 0950 Gabrielle Fund.   It is indeed true, as stated in the famous
B15 0960 novel of our day, "For Whom the Bell Tolls", that "no man
B15 0970 is an island, entirely of itself; every man is a piece of the continent,
B15 0980 a part of the main".   Thanks to the generosity of Mr&
B15 0990 Irving J& Fain, president of the Temple Beth El; Rev&
B15 1000 DeWitt Clemens, pastor of the Mathewson Street Methodist Church;
B15 1010 Mr& Felix Miranda, of the Imperial Knife Co&; and to Mrs&
B15 1020 Rozella Switzer, regional director of The National Conference
B15 1030 of Christians and Jews, who asked them to serve as a committee for
B15 1040 the fund. It is through them that we have become aware of the divine
B15 1050 humanity in man, and therefore, that most people are noble, helpful
B15 1060 and good.   Bless you my friends, for it is through love and service
B15 1070 that brotherhood becomes a reality. @
B15 1080    I am a sophomore at Mount Pleasant High School. My future
B15 1090 plans are to become a language teacher. Of course, having this desire,
B15 1100 I am very interested in education.   A few weeks ago, I read
B15 1110 in the Bulletin that there were to be given Chinese classes in Cranston.
B15 1120 The article also said that a person had to be 18 years old or
B15 1130 over, and must not be going to high school to attend these classes.
B15 1140    The following week, I read in the Sunday paper that the students
B15 1150 of Russia begin European and Asian languages in the seventh grade.
B15 1160    I wish you could see the situation as I see it. If Russian
B15 1170 pupils have to take these languages, how come American students have
B15 1180 a choice whether or not to take a language, but have to face so many
B15 1190 exceptions?   I do not think that America is like Russia,
B15 1200 not in the least! I am proud of my country, the small city I live
B15 1210 in, my wonderful parents, my friends and my school; but I am also
B15 1220 a young, able and willing girl who wants to study the Chinese language
B15 1230 but is not old enough.   Then people wonder why Russian pupils
B15 1240 are more advanced than American students. Well, there lies your answer.

B15 1260    At the height of the first snowstorm we had, it was impossible
B15 1270 for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency.   However,
B15 1280 the East Providence Rescue Squad made its way through to my
B15 1290 home in time of desperation.   Words cannot tell of the undivided
B15 1300 attention and comfort their service gave to me. The concern they
B15 1310 felt for me was such as I shall never forget and for which I will always
B15 1320 be grateful.   The rescue squad is to be praised immensely
B15 1330 for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather. Had they not gotten
B15 1340 me to the hospital when they did, perhaps I would not be here to
B15 1350 commend them at this time.   Many thanks for a job well
B15 1355 done. @
B15 1360    The Providence Sunday Journal article (Jan& 29) asking whether
B15 1370 American taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway
B15 1380 to pay for the care of war veterans who have non-service-connected disabilities
B15 1390 sounds as though The Providence Journal is desperate for
B15 1400 news. Usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front
B15 1410 page.   On the question of admission to Veterans Administration
B15 1420 hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected disabled
B15 1430 veterans, it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly
B15 1440 affected by war service. It can manifest itself before discharge from
B15 1450 service, or it can come out years later. There is one other point
B15 1460 we should never lose sight of: Many veterans who enter ~VA hospitals
B15 1470 as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected. No psychiatrist
B15 1480 could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its
B15 1490 effect in the ensuing years.   The arguments advanced by those individuals
B15 1500 and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically
B15 1510 curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the non-service-connected
B15 1520 case, seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with
B15 1530 the wishes of the general public.   I believe in priority for
B15 1540 service-connected disabled veterans in admission to ~VA hospitals.
B15 1550 But I don't believe we should close the door on nonservice-connected
B15 1560 patients. This matter is of great importance, and the outcome may
B15 1570 mean the difference between life or death, or at least serious injuries,
B15 1580 for many veterans.   Some critics say that the length of stay
B15 1590 in a hospital is too long. There's a reason for this length of stay.
B15 1600 First of all, the admitting physician in the ~VA hospital gets
B15 1610 the patient as a new patient. He has no experience with this veteran's
B15 1620 previous medical record. If the doctor is conscientious, he wants
B15 1630 to study the patient. As a result, it takes a little longer than
B15 1640 it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient.
B15 1650    Secondly, the ~VA physician knows that when the patient
B15 1660 leaves the hospital, he is no longer going to have a chance to visit
B15 1670 his patient. So he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects
B15 1680 of treatment or surgery.   The American public must be presented
B15 1690 with the facts concerning ~VA hospitalization. The public
B15 1700 should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a ~VA
B15 1710 hospital, the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other. The
B15 1720 responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a ~VA
B15 1730 hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital. An
B15 1740 adequate system of ~VA hospitals is better equipped to care for the
B15 1750 veterans than any 50 state hospitals. @
B15 1760    It seems that open season upon veterans' hospitalization is
B15 1770 once more upon us. The American Medical Association is once again
B15 1780 grinding out its tear-soaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the
B15 1790 Veterans Administration medical program to the American taxpayer.
B15 1800 Do they, the A&M&A&, offer any solution other than outright
B15 1810 abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world?
B15 1820    We veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand
B15 1830 for medical care at ~VA hospitals will grow proportionately as age
B15 1840 fosters illness. Nevertheless, we wonder at the stand of the A&M&A&
B15 1850 on the health problem confronting the aged. They opposed
B15 1860 the Forand bill, which would have placed the major burden of financial
B15 1870 support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction;
B15 1880 yet they supported the Eisenhower administration which will
B15 1890 cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars (matched
B15 1900 incidentally by a federal grant) to initiate.
B16 0010 #"A LOUSY JOB"# _CHICAGO, AUG& 9_- No doubt there have
B16 0020 been moments during every Presidency when the man in the White House
B16 0030 has had feelings of frustration, exasperation, exhaustion, and even
B16 0040 panic. This we can sympathetically understand. But no President ever
B16 0050 before referred to his as a "lousy job" [as Walter Trohan recently
B16 0060 quoted President Kennedy as doing in conversation with Sen&
B16 0070 Barry Goldwater].   During his aggressive campaign to win
B16 0080 his present position, Mr& Kennedy was vitriolic about this country's
B16 0090 "prestige" abroad. What does he think a remark like this "lousy"
B16 0100 one does to our prestige and morale?   If the President
B16 0110 of the United States really feels he won himself a "lousy job",
B16 0120 then heaven help us all. @ #QUESTIONS SHELTERS# _EVANSVILLE,
B16 0130 IND&, AUG& 5_- Defense Secretary Robert S& McNamara
B16 0140 has asked Congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters
B16 0150 costing about 200 million dollars. Why should Congress even consider
B16 0160 allowing such a sum for that which can give no protection?
B16 0170    Top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of
B16 0180 massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would
B16 0190 persist for a long time. The scientists have also warned that no life
B16 0200 above ground or underground, sheltered or unsheltered could be expected
B16 0210 to survive in an area at least 50 miles in diameter.   This
B16 0220 sum spent for foreign economic aid, the peace corps, food for peace,
B16 0230 or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries
B16 0240 would be an investment that would pay off in world peace, increased
B16 0250 world trade, and prosperity for every country on the globe.
B16 0260 Let us prepare for peace, instead of for a war which would mean the
B16 0270 end of civilization. @ #SHORT SHORTS ON THE CAMPUS# _CHICAGO,
B16 0280 AUG& 4_- It seems college isn't what it should be. I refer to
B16 0290 the attire worn by the students. Upon a visit to a local junior college
B16 0300 last week, I was shocked to see the young ladies wearing short shorts
B16 0310 and the young men wearing Bermuda shorts.   Is this what
B16 0320 our children are to come face to face with when they are ready for college
B16 0325 in a few years?
B16 0330 Education should be uppermost in their minds, but
B16 0340 with this attire how can anyone think it is so? It looks more like
B16 0350 they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering
B16 0360 themselves.   High school students have more sense of the
B16 0370 way to dress than college students. Many high school students go past
B16 0380 my house every day, and they look like perfect ladies and gentlemen.
B16 0390 No matter how hot the day, they are dressed properly and not in shorts.
B16 0395 @ #MASARYK AWARD#
B16 0400 _CHICAGO, AUG& 9_- The granting of
B16 0410 the Jan Masaryk award August 13 to Senator Paul Douglas is a bitter
B16 0420 example of misleading minorities.   Douglas has consistently
B16 0430 voted to aid the people who killed Masaryk, and against principles
B16 0440 Masaryk died to uphold. Douglas has voted for aid to Communists and
B16 0450 for the destruction of individual freedom [public housing, foreign aid,
B16 0460 etc&]. @ #SUBSIDIES FROM ~CTA# _OAK PARK, AUG&
B16 0470 8_- In today's "Voice", the ~CTA is urged to reduce fares
B16 0480 for senior citizens. Rising costs have increased the difficulties
B16 0490 of the elderly, and I would be the last to say they should not receive
B16 0500 consideration. But why is it the special responsibility of the ~CTA
B16 0510 to help these people?   Why should ~CTA regular riders
B16 0520 subsidize reduced transportation for old people any more than the
B16 0530 people who drive their own cars or walk to work should? The welfare
B16 0540 of citizens, old and young, is the responsibility of the community,
B16 0550 not only of that part of it that rides the ~CTA. ~CTA regulars
B16 0560 already subsidize transportation for school children, policemen,
B16 0570 and firemen. @ #MARKETING MEAT# _CHICAGO, AUG& 9_- In
B16 0580 reply to a letter in today's "voice" urging the sale of meat after
B16 0590 6 p& m&, I wish to state the other side of the story.   I
B16 0600 am the wife of the owner of a small, independent meat market. My husband's
B16 0610 hours away from home for the past years have been from 7 a&
B16 0620 m& to 7 p& m& the early part of the week, and as late as 8 or
B16 0630 9 on week-ends. Now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings-
B16 0640 and Sundays, too, for this is coming.   There is a trend to
B16 0650 packaging meat at a central source, freezing it, and shipping it to outlying
B16 0660 stores, where meat cutters will not be required. If a customer
B16 0670 wishes a special cut, it will not be available. We are slowly being
B16 0680 regimented to having everything packaged, whether we want it or not.
B16 0690    Most women, in this age of freezers, shop for the entire week
B16 0700 on week-ends, when prices are lower. Also, many working wives have children
B16 0710 or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them.
B16 0720 Independent market owners work six days a week; and my husband hasn't
B16 0730 had a vacation in 14 years. No, we are not greedy. But if we closed
B16 0740 the store for a vacation, we would lose our customers to the chain
B16 0750 stores in the next block.   The meat cutters' union, which has
B16 0760 a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area,
B16 0770 represents the little corner markets as well as the large supermarkets.
B16 0780 What it is trying to do is to protect the little man, too, as well
B16 0790 as trying to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores, with choice
B16 0800 of cut being made by the consumer, not the store. @ #THE LEGION
B16 0810 CONVENTION AND SIDNEY HOLZMAN# _CHICAGO, AUG& 9_- I, too,
B16 0820 congratulate the American Legion, of which I am proud to have been
B16 0830 a member for more than 40 years, on the recent state convention.
B16 0840    I regret that Bertha Madeira [today's "Voice"] obtained
B16 0850 incorrect information. Had I been granted the floor on a point of
B16 0860 personal privilege, the matter she raised would have been clarified.
B16 0870    The resolution under discussion at the convention was to require
B16 0880 the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the
B16 0890 American flag. Judges under the jurisdiction of the Chicago board of
B16 0900 election commissioners are instructed to do this.   The resolution
B16 0910 further asked that polling place proprietors affix an attachment
B16 0920 to their premises for the display of the flag.   It was my desire
B16 0930 to advise the membership of the Legion that the majority of polling
B16 0940 places are on private property and, without an amendment to the law,
B16 0950 we could not enforce this. My discussion with reference to the resolution
B16 0960 was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of
B16 0970 election and who properly discharge their duty and polling place proprietors
B16 0980 who make available their private premises, and not by innuendo
B16 0990 criticize them. At no time did I attempt to seek approval or commendation
B16 1000 for the members of the Chicago board of election commissioners
B16 1010 for the discharge of their duties. @ #TEACHING THE HANDICAPPED#
B16 1020 _CHICAGO, AUG& 7_- The Illinois Commission for Handicapped
B16 1030 Children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the Catholic
B16 1040 charities of the archdiocese of Chicago and DePaul university of
B16 1050 the establishment of the Institute for Special Education at the university
B16 1060 for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally
B16 1070 retarded children.   In these days of serious shortage
B16 1080 of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped
B16 1090 and mentally handicapped children, the establishment of such an institute
B16 1100 will be a major contribution to the field.   The Illinois
B16 1110 Commission for Handicapped Children, which for 20 years has had the
B16 1120 responsibility of coo^rdinating the services of tax supported and voluntary
B16 1130 organizations serving handicapped children, of studying the
B16 1135 needs
B16 1140 of handicapped children in Illinois, and of promoting more adequate
B16 1150 services for them, indeed welcomes this new important resource which will
B16 1160 help the people of Illinois toward the goal of providing an education
B16 1170 for all of its children. @ #FROM CANDLELIGHT CLUB# _MINNEAPOLIS,

B16 1210 one of our greatest entertainers and a really wonderful person. @
B16 1220 #MORE SCHOOL, LESS PAY# _CHICAGO, AUG& 7_- Is this,
B16 1230 perhaps,
B16 1240 one of the things that is wrong with our country?   Engineering
B16 1250 graduates of Illinois Institute of Technology are reported receiving
B16 1260 the highest average starting salaries in the school's history-
B16 1270 $550 a month.   My son, who has completed two years in engineering
B16 1280 school, has a summer job on a construction project as an unskilled
B16 1290 laborer. At a rate of $3.22 an hour he is now earning approximately
B16 1300 $580 a month.   Ironic, is it not, that after completing years
B16 1310 of costly scientific training he will receive a cut in pay from what
B16 1320 he is receiving as an ordinary unskilled laborer? @ #THE DUPONT
B16 1330 CASE# [<Editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this
B16 1340 page>.] _WASHINGTON, AUG& 4_- Your July 26 editorial regarding
B16 1350 the position of Attorney General Robert F& Kennedy on prospective
B16 1360 tax relief for du Pont stockholders is based on an erroneous
B16 1370 statement of fact. As a result, your criticism of Attorney General
B16 1380 Robert F& Kennedy and the department of justice was inaccurate,
B16 1390 unwarranted and unfair.   The editorial concerned legislative proposals
B16 1400 to ease the tax burden on du Pont stockholders, in connection
B16 1410 with the United States Supreme court ruling that du Pont must divest
B16 1420 itself of its extensive General Motors stock holdings. These proposals
B16 1430 would reduce the amount of tax that du Pont stockholders might
B16 1440 have to pay- from an estimated 1.1 billion dollars under present
B16 1450 law to as little as 192 million dollars.   Congressman Wilbur D&
B16 1460 Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, asked
B16 1470 the department of justice for its views on these legislative proposals
B16 1480 as they related to anti-trust law enforcement. The attorney general
B16 1490 responded by letter dated July 19. Copies of this letter were made
B16 1500 avaliable to the press and public.   In this letter, Mr& Kennedy
B16 1510 made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration-
B16 1520 what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti-trust
B16 1530 judgments. There are a number of other considerations besides
B16 1540 this one but it is for the Congress, not the department of justice,
B16 1550 to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation.
B16 1560    Yet your editorial said: "Now the attorney general
B16 1570 writes that no considerations 'justify any loss of revenue of this
B16 1580 proportion'". What Mr& Kennedy, in fact, wrote was: "It
B16 1590 is the department's view that no <anti-trust enforcement> considerations
B16 1600 justify any loss of revenue of this proportion".   The
B16 1610 editorial, by omitting the words <anti-trust enforcement>, totally
B16 1620 distorted Mr& Kennedy's views. The headline is offensive, particularly
B16 1630 in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial. @ #CONGRESSWOMAN
B16 1640 CHURCH# _WILMETTE, AUG& 7_- I concur most heartily
B16 1650 with today's letter on the futility of writing to Sen& Dirksen
B16 1660 and Sen& Douglas.   But when you write to Congresswoman
B16 1670 Church, bless her heart, your letter is answered fully and completely.
B16 1680 Should she disagree, she explains why in detail. When she agrees,
B16 1690 you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged.   I think
B16 1700 we have the hardest working, best representative in Congress. #HARMFUL
B16 1710 DRINKS# _DOWNERS GROVE, AUG& 8_- A recent news story
B16 1720 reported that Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin delayed 103 airplane
B16 1730 passengers 10 minutes in London while they finished their drinks.
B16 1740    They do our country great harm by such actions. Those in the public
B16 1750 eye should be good examples of American citizens while abroad.
B16 1760    The plane should have started at the scheduled time and left Sinatra
B16 1770 and Martin to guzzle. @ #TOWARD SOCIALISM# _PROVIDENCE,
B16 1780 AUG& 5_- Overt socialism means government ownership and management
B16 1790 of a nation's main industries. In covert socialism- toward
B16 1800 which America is moving- private enterprise retains the ownership
B16 1810 title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive
B16 1820 regulations actually controls them.   In order to attract
B16 1830 new industries, 15 states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build
B16 1840 government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise. This
B16 1850 is a step toward overt socialism.   Issuing bonds for plant construction
B16 1860 has brought new industries to certain regions.
B17 0010 #"WORKERS OF THE PARTY"# _TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- We are
B17 0020 writing in reference to a recent "suggestion" made to the staff
B17 0030 of the Public Health Nursing Service of Jersey City (registered
B17 0040 professional nurses with college background and varying experiences).
B17 0050 The day before Election Day, to which we are entitled as a legal holiday,
B17 0060 we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as "workers
B17 0070 of the party".   Being ethical and professional people
B17 0080 interested in community health and well-being, we felt this wasn't
B17 0090 a function of our position. Such tactics reek of totalitarianism!
B17 0100 As we understand, this directive was given to all city and county employes.
B17 0110    To our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed
B17 0120 because of political affiliation. We, therefore, considered the "suggestion"
B17 0130 an insult to our intelligence, ethics, Bill of Rights,
B17 0140 etc&. Our only obligation for this day is to vote, free of persuasion,
B17 0150 for the person we feel is capable in directing the public.
B17 0160    This is our duty- not as nurses or city employes- but as citizens
B17 0170 of the United States. @ #"PLUS-ONE" SHELTERS# _TO THE
B17 0180 EDITOR:_ Sir- I read of a man who felt he should not build
B17 0190 a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to
B17 0200 sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters. Does this man live in
B17 0210 a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves,
B17 0220 but ready to demand that "the community" help and protect them?
B17 0230    Community shelters are, of course, necessary for those
B17 0235 having
B17 0240 no space for shelter. If in a town of 2,000 private homes, half of
B17 0250 them have shelters, the need for the community shelters will be reduced
B17 0260 to that extent.   In designing his home fallout shelter there
B17 0270 is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home's occupants,
B17 0280 "plus-one"- so he will be able to take in a stranger. I
B17 0290 hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes
B17 0300 will have a change of heart, will get busy and be the first member of
B17 0310 our "plus-one" shelter club. @ #ESCAPE# _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0320 Sir- People continue to inquire the reason for the race for outer
B17 0330 space. It's simple enough from my point of view. I am for it.
B17 0340    It is the only method left for a man to escape from a woman's
B17 0350 world. @ #SUPPORTS KATANGA# _TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- When
B17 0360 the colonies decided upon freedom from England, we insisted, through
B17 0370 the Declaration of Independence, that the nations of the world recognize
B17 0380 us as a separate political entity. It is high time the United
B17 0390 States began to realize that the God-given rights of men set forth
B17 0400 in that document are applicable today to Katanga.   In the United
B17 0410 Nations Charter, the right of self-determination is also an essential
B17 0420 principle. This, again, applies to Katanga. The people of Katanga
B17 0430 had fought for, and obtained, their freedom from the Communist
B17 0440 yoke of Antoine Gizenga, and his cohorts. By political, economic, geographic
B17 0450 and natural standards, they were justified in doing so.
B17 0460    The United States and the U&N& denounce their own principles
B17 0470 when they defend the Communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge
B17 0480 the right of self-determination of the Katangans. @ #COUNTY
B17 0490 COLLEGE COSTS# _TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- Permit me to commend
B17 0500 your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county
B17 0510 colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers
B17 0520 have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit
B17 0530 them to.   The bill which passed the Assembly last May and
B17 0540 is now pending in the Senate should be given careful scrutiny. The procedure
B17 0550 for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges
B17 0560 and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers.
B17 0570    Under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county
B17 0580 college will be appointed; none will be elected. The trustees
B17 0590 will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board
B17 0600 of school estimate. This board will consist of two of the trustees
B17 0610 of the college, and the director and two members of the board of freeholders.
B17 0620 It will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college
B17 0630 and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders, which "shall
B17 0640 appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made
B17 0650 by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed, levied
B17 0660 and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes".
B17 0670    The approval of only three members of the board of
B17 0680 school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted
B17 0690 to the college. Since two of these could be trustees of the college,
B17 0700 actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected
B17 0710 official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue.
B17 0720 This is taxation without representation. @
B17 0730 #TAXING IMPROVEMENTS# _TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- Your editorial,
B17 0740 "Housing Speedup", is certainly not the answer to our slum problems.
B17 0750 The very rules and regulations in every city are the primary
B17 0760 case of slum conditions.   Change our taxing law so that no tax
B17 0770 shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties.
B17 0780 Then see what a boom in all trades, as well as slum clearance
B17 0790 at no cost to taxpayers, will happen. Our entire economy will have
B17 0800 a terrific uplift. @ #"NATURAL CAUSES"# _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0810 Sir- An old man is kicked to death by muggers. The medical examiner
B17 0820 states that death was due to "natural causes".   I once

B17 0840 it is listed as "death due to natural causes". @ #PRAISES
B17 0850 EXHIBIT# _TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- Every resident of this city
B17 0860 should visit the Newark Museum and see the exhibit "Our Changing
B17 0870 Skyline in Newark". It will be at the museum until March 30.
B17 0880    It is a revelation of what has been done, what is being done
B17 0890 and what will be done in Newark as shown by architects' plans, models
B17 0900 and pictures. It shows what a beautiful city Newark will become and
B17 0910 certainly make every Newarker proud of this city.   It should
B17 0920 also make him desire to participate actively in civic, school and religious
B17 0930 life of the community so that that phase of Newark will live
B17 0940 up to the challenge presented by this exhibit. @ #PARKWAY COURTESY#
B17 0950 _TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- I hasten to join in praise of the
B17 0960 men in the toll booths on the Garden State Parkway. Recently I traveled
B17 0970 the parkway from East Orange to Cape May and I found the most
B17 0980 courteous group of men you will find anywhere. One even gave my little
B17 0990 dog a biscuit. It was very refreshing. @
B17 1000 #"DEEP PEEP SHOW"# The viewers of the "deep Peep Show"
B17 1010 at 15th and ~M streets nw& have an added attraction- the view
B17 1020 of a fossilized cypress swamp. Twenty feet below the street level
B17 1030 in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site, a black
B17 1040 coal-like deposit has been encountered.   This is a black swamp
B17 1050 clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypress-like trees
B17 1060 were growing. The fossilized remains of many of these trees are found
B17 1070 embedded in the clay. Some of the stumps are as much as three feet
B17 1080 long, but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying
B17 1090 sediments. Although the wood has been changed to coal, much
B17 1100 of it still retains its original cell structure.   In the clay are
B17 1110 entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants
B17 1120 growing in the region at the time. These microfossils indicate the
B17 1130 swamp was "formed during the Lower Cretaceous period when dinosaurs
B17 1140 were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing.
B17 1150    The 15th Street deposit is not to be confused with
B17 1160 the nearby famous Mayflower Hotel cypress swamp on 17th Street reported
B17 1170 in <The Washington Post>, August 2, 1955, which was probably
B17 1180 formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger.
B17 1190 @ #WORKING FOR PEACE# Recently the secretary of the Friends
B17 1200 Committee on National Legislation was interviewed on the air.
B17 1210 While I respect his sincere concern for peace, he made four points
B17 1220 that I would like to question. _1._ He said, "Let's work for
B17 1230 peace instead of protection from aggression". I would ask, "Why
B17 1240 not do both"? Military power does not cause war; war is the result
B17 1250 of mistrust and lack of understanding between people. Are we not
B17 1260 late, especially those of us who call ourselves Friends, in doing enough
B17 1270 about this lack of understanding? _2._ As to protection,
B17 1280 the speaker disapproved of shelters, pointing out that fallout shelters
B17 1290 would not save everyone. Is this a reason for saving no one? Would
B17 1300 the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his
B17 1310 boat could not pick up everyone? _3._ The speaker suggested
B17 1320 that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face.
B17 1330 If the world comes to this, wouldn't it be the very time when courage
B17 1340 and American know-how would be needed to help survivors rebuild?
B17 1350 Many of our young people think it would. _4._ Lastly, the speaker
B17 1360 decried our organized program of emergency help calling it "Civilian
B17 1370 Defense". In 1950, Public Law 920 created Civil Defense
B17 1380 (different from Civilian-groups of World War /2,), a responsibility
B17 1390 of the Government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property
B17 1400 in disaster, natural or manmade.   Far from creating fear,
B17 1410 as the speaker suggests, preparedness- knowing what to do in an emergency-
B17 1420 gives people confidence. Civil Defense has far to go and
B17 1430 many problems to solve, but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer
B17 1440 tradition to be not only willing, but prepared to care for our own families
B17 1450 and help our neighbors in any disaster- storm, flood, accident
B17 1460 or even war? @ #PETS IN APARTMENTS# It seems rather peculiar
B17 1470 that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves
B17 1480 with the protection and companionship of dogs. I feel that few
B17 1490 burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone's apartment
B17 1500 if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide. In
B17 1510 addition, would not the young female public of Washington be afforded
B17 1520 a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets
B17 1530 if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash?   I grant that
B17 1540 the dog may not be really protective, based on his training, but if you
B17 1550 were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady
B17 1560 to molest, how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with
B17 1570 a dog? I would like to suggest that the landlords and Commissioners
B17 1580 get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting
B17 1590 dogs in apartments. @ #SIDEWALK CAFES# Use the terraces of the
B17 1600 Capitol for a sidewalk cafe? Could Senator Humphrey be serious
B17 1610 in his proposal? Is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists'
B17 1620 comfort?   Perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could
B17 1630 be extended. The Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials are rather bleak.
B17 1640 Why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel
B17 1650 too far to eat? Unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money
B17 1660 to support themselves during the off season. As an added suggestion
B17 1670 to balance the budget, the Government could sell advertising space
B17 1680 on the Washington Monument. It is visible throughout the city, and
B17 1690 men from Madison ave& would jump at the chance. @ #@# Sen&
B17 1700 Hubert Humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart. He, like
B17 1710 most of us, wants to be able to sit, to contemplate and be moved by
B17 1720 the great outdoors. Let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas
B17 1730 around fountains and gardens. Let us, like the French, have outdoor
B17 1740 cafes where we may relax, converse at leisure and enjoy the passing
B17 1750 crowd. @ #DISSENTING VIEWS OF SENATORS# Two strong dissents from
B17 1760 the majority report of the Joint Economic Committee (May 2) by
B17 1770 Senators Proxmire and Butler allege that the New Deal fiscal policy
B17 1780 of the Thirties did not work.
B18 0010 #FOR A NEUTRAL GERMANY# @ _SOVIETS SAID TO FEAR RESURGENCE OF
B18 0020 GERMAN MILITARISM_ @ _TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_
B18 0030 For the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large,
B18 0040 powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional
B18 0050 warfare of the past a nullity. The United States and Soviet
B18 0060 Russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations. Recent
B18 0065 statements
B18 0070 by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power
B18 0080 of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient
B18 0090 to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead
B18 0100 of negotiations.   President Kennedy was right when he said, "We
B18 0110 shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate".
B18 0120 I have just returned from a seven-week trip to Europe and
B18 0130 the Far East. It is quite evident that the people of Western Europe
B18 0140 are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war. The
B18 0150 fact is that the Italians, French and British know that they have
B18 0160 no defense against nuclear bombs. We have no right to criticize them,
B18 0170 as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war.
B18 0180 We should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access
B18 0190 into Berlin. It would be criminal folly if the Communists tried to
B18 0200 prevent us. But there is nothing we can do to stop Soviet Russia from
B18 0210 granting de facto recognition to East Germany. Soviet Russia has
B18 0220 been invaded twice by German troops in a generation. In the last war
B18 0230 Russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories
B18 0240 were devastated. _PROBABLE AGREEMENT_ The truth is that Communist
B18 0250 Russia fears the resurgence of German militarism. Berlin is merely
B18 0260 being used by Moscow as a stalking horse. Actually, the
B18 0265 Communists,
B18 0270 out of fear of a united and armed Germany, would probably be willing
B18 0280 to agree to a disarmed Germany that would be united and neutral
B18 0290 and have its independence guaranteed by the U& N&.   If
B18 0300 the Communists are sincere in wanting a united, neutral and disarmed
B18 0310 Germany, it might well be advantageous for the German people in this
B18 0320 nuclear age. It could provide security without cost of armaments and
B18 0330 increase German prosperity and lessen taxation. France and other Western
B18 0340 European nations likewise fear a rearmed Germany. If the German
B18 0350 people favor such a settlement we should not oppose Germany following
B18 0360 the example of Austria.   President Kennedy has urged a
B18 0370 peace race on disarmament that might be called "Operation Survival"
B18 0380 which has many facets. Why not make a beginning with a united and
B18 0390 disarmed Germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing
B18 0400 would be guaranteed by the Big Four powers and the United States?
B18 0410 A united Germany, freed of militarism, might be the first step toward
B18 0420 disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world. @ #MEETING
B18 0430 U& N& OBLIGATIONS# _TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK
B18 0440 TIMES:_ In your editorial of Sept& 30 "The Smoldering Congo"
B18 0450 you make the following comment: "Far too many states are following
B18 0460 the Russian example in refusing to pay their assessments. It
B18 0470 is up to the Assembly to take action against them. They are violating
B18 0480 their Charter obligation, the prescribed penalty for which is suspension
B18 0490 of membership or expulsion".   I would like to quote from
B18 0500 the Charter of the United Nations:   "Article 17, Section
B18 0510 1: The General Assembly shall consider and approve the budget
B18 0520 of the Organization.   "Section 2: The expenses of the
B18 0530 Organization shall be borne by the Members as apportioned by the General
B18 0540 Assembly.   "Article 19: A Member of the United Nations
B18 0550 which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions
B18 0560 to the Organization shall have no vote in the General Assembly if
B18 0570 the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions
B18 0580 due from it for the preceding two full years".   The U&
B18 0590 S& S& R& and her followers are careful in paying their obligations
B18 0600 to the regular budget. But they refuse, as do the Arab states,
B18 0610 to support the United Nations' expenses of maintaining the United
B18 0620 Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East as a buffer between
B18 0630 Egypt and Israel, and the U& N& troops in the Congo, which
B18 0640 expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the United Nations,
B18 0650 but by a special budget.   According to the official interpretation
B18 0660 of the Charter, a member cannot be penalized by not having the
B18 0670 right to vote in the General Assembly for nonpayment of financial
B18 0680 obligations to the "special" United Nations' budgets, and of
B18 0690 course cannot be expelled from the Organization (which you suggested
B18 0700 in your editorial), due to the fact that there is no provision in the
B18 0710 Charter for expulsion. @ #TO AID INTERNATIONAL LAW# @ _CONNALLY
B18 0720 AMENDMENT'S REPEAL HELD STEP TOWARD WORLD ORDER_ @ _TO THE
B18 0730 EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_ In your Sept& 27 editorial appraisal
B18 0740 of the work of the First Session of the Eighty-seventh Congress
B18 0750 you referred to the lack of "consciousness of destiny in a time
B18 0760 of acute national and world peril". Yet your list of things left
B18 0770 undone did not include repeal of the Connally amendment to this country's
B18 0780 domestic jurisdiction reservation to its Adherence to the Statute
B18 0790 of the International Court of Justice.   The Connally
B18 0800 amendment says that the United States, rather than the court, shall
B18 0810 determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction
B18 0820 of the United States in a case before the World Court to which
B18 0830 the United States is a party. If the case is thus determined by us
B18 0840 to be domestic, the court has no jurisdiction.   Since the Connally
B18 0850 amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other
B18 0860 party to a dispute with the United States, it also prevents us from
B18 0870 using the court effectively. Yet although the Kennedy Administration,
B18 0880 and the Eisenhower Administration before it, have both declared themselves
B18 0890 solidly for repeal of the Connally amendment, as contrary to
B18 0900 our best interests, no action has yet been taken.   Our "destiny"
B18 0910 in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit
B18 0920 of peace, with justice, under law. To achieve this destiny, acts
B18 0930 as well as words are needed- not only acts that lead to physical strength
B18 0940 but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect.
B18 0950    What better affirmative step could be taken to this end
B18 0960 than repeal of the Connally amendment- an act which could expose
B18 0970 the
B18 0980 United States to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self-judging
B18 0990 attitude toward the court, enable us to utilize it, and advance
B18 1000 in a tangible way the cause of international law and order?
B18 1010    We believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the
B18 1020 Eighty-seventh Congress should have included repeal by the Senate
B18 1030 of the Connally amendment. @ #FOR BETTER SUBWAY SERVICES# _TO
B18 1040 THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_ Many home-bound subway riders
B18 1050 utilizing the Flushing-Main Street express are daily confronted with
B18 1060 the sight of the local departing from the Woodside station as their
B18 1070 express comes to a stop, leaving them stranded and strained. To the
B18 1080 tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to Seventy-fourth Street
B18 1090 and change for the ~IND, this takes a daily toll of time and temper.
B18 1100    The Transit Authority has recently placed in operation
B18 1110 "hold" lights at ~BMT Thirty-ninth and Fifty-ninth Street
B18 1120 stations in Brooklyn. This "holds" the local until the express
B18 1130 passengers change trains. Without question, this time and temper saver
B18 1140 should be immediately installed at the Woodside station. @ #PHONE
B18 1150 SERVICE CRITICIZED# _TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_
B18 1160 As a business man I have to use the telephone constantly, from three
B18 1170 to four hours a day.   In the last few years the telephone company
B18 1180 has managed to automate many areas of their service. It has not
B18 1190 been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization
B18 1200 which has brought about new ways of dialing.   However, there
B18 1210 are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone
B18 1220 operators. I have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the
B18 1230 young ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls, special long-distance
B18 1240 calls, etc&. Either it is lack of training, lack of proper
B18 1250 screening when hiring, lack of management or possibly lack of interest
B18 1260 on the part of the telephone company, which does have a Government-blessed
B18 1270 monopoly.
B18 1280 #FAIR-PRICED FUNERAL# _TO THE EDITOR:_ I disagree with the
B18 1290 writer who says funeral services should be government-controlled.
B18 1295 The funeral
B18 1300 for my husband was just what I wanted and I paid a fair price, far
B18 1310 less than I had expected to pay. But the hospitals and doctors should
B18 1320 be. @ #HELPING RETARDED CHILDREN# _TO THE EDITOR:_ Recently
B18 1330 I visited the very remarkable Pilgrim School for retarded children.
B18 1340    Hazel Park donates its recreation center, five days a
B18 1350 week, to the school. There is no charge and no state aid. Kiwanis,
B18 1360 American Legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do
B18 1370 what they can to bring in dollars for its support.   There are
B18 1380 70 children there and the mothers donate one day a week to the school.
B18 1390 Reading, writing and simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts
B18 1400 as working in brass. They make beautiful objects.   Enough
B18 1410 trading stamps were collected to buy a 12-passenger station wagon. Southfield
B18 1420 schools furnish an old 45-passenger bus (the heater in which
B18 1430 needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need
B18 1440 the heat).   The school is located at 9-1/2 Mile road, Woodward
B18 1450 Heights. Visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated
B18 1460 mothers can do. @ #JOBS FOR CAVANAGH# _TO THE EDITOR:_ I
B18 1470 was surprised at Mayor Miriani's defeat, but perhaps Mayor-elect
B18 1480 Cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years
B18 1490 ago. Maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city
B18 1500 departments such as welfare, ~DPW and sanitation. Negligence in
B18 1510 garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great.   He
B18 1520 should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at
B18 1530 night. There should be better bus service and all of our city departments
B18 1540 and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling.
B18 1550    Our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and I have yet to
B18 1560 read of a conviction in a littering case.   Drunken truck drivers
B18 1570 in the city departments should be weeded out. Educate the city employes
B18 1580 to give real service to the public. After all, they are paid by
B18 1590 the public, they should be examples. @ #CHURCH FINDS NEWS FEATURES
B18 1600 ARE HELPFUL# _TO THE EDITOR:_ At a recent meeting of the Women's
B18 1610 Association of the Trumbull Ave& United Presbyterian
B18 1620 Church, considerable use was made of material from The Detroit News
B18 1630 on the King James version of the New Testament versus the New English
B18 1640 Bible.   Some members of the organization called attention
B18 1650 also to the article on hymns of inspiration, the Daily Prayer and
B18 1660 Three Minutes a Day, as being very helpful.   We feel that
B18 1670 The Detroit News is to be complimented upon arranging for articles
B18 1680 on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material
B18 1690 along wholesome lines. @ #RUDE YOUNGSTERS# _TO THE EDITOR:_
B18 1700 Thank you for the article by George Sokolsky on the public apathy
B18 1710 to impudence.   How old do you have to be to remember when Americans,
B18 1720 especially children, were encouraged to be polite? Why has
B18 1730 this form of gentility gone out of American life?   How can
B18 1740 we old-fashioned parents, who still feel that adults are due some respect
B18 1750 from children, battle the new type of advertising that appears on
B18 1760 ~TV without denying the children the use of television entirely?
B18 1770 Writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of "modern"
B18 1780 parents they have observed. From necessity, they are also inspired
B18 1790 by the "hard-sell" attitude of the sponsor, so, finally, it
B18 1800 is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste
B18 1810 of his advertising. @ #DUNES PARK ADVOCATE# _TO THE EDITOR:_

B19 0020 to
B19 0030 congratulate Inspector Trimmer and his efficient police troops in
B19 0040 cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles. We have now a quiet
B19 0050 city, fewer automobiles, less congestion, and fewer retail customers shopping
B19 0060 in center city. Good for Mr& Trimmer. Maybe he will help
B19 0070 to turn our fair city into a "ghost" town. @ #DEFENDS BIG TRUCKS#
B19 0080 _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ I worked on the Schuylkill
B19 0090 Expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock
B19 0100 and concrete there wouldn't be an Expressway. Without these massive
B19 0110 trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future.
B19 0120 Mr& George Hough (Oct& 30) sounds like a business man who waits
B19 0130 until the last minute to leave his home or shop. The trucks today
B19 0140 help pay for this highway. They try to keep within the speed limits.
B19 0150 Although today's trucks are as fast as passenger cars, a truck driver
B19 0160 has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road. @
B19 0170 #OUT OF SCHOOL AT 14# _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ The
B19 0180 letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school
B19 0190 at 14 should have signed his letter "SIMPLETON" instead of
B19 0200 "SIMPLICITUDE". Such kids only wind up among the unemployed
B19 0210 on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden. There are
B19 0220 lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates, but not for
B19 0230 the dropouts. What we need is more vocational training in high schools,
B19 0240 not more dropouts. @ #TWO WRONGS# _TO THE EDITOR OF THE
B19 0250 INQUIRER:_ I suppose I am missing some elementary point but I honestly
B19 0260 cannot see how two wrongs can make a right! I am referring
B19 0270 to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because
B19 0280 Russia is. Will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less
B19 0290 harmful to future generations of children? If an atom bomb in 1945
B19 0300 could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have
B19 0310 is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it.
B19 0320    As I see it, if war starts and we survive the initial attack
B19 0330 enough to be able to fight back, the nuclear weapons we now have-
B19 0340 at least the bombs- can inflict all the demage that is necessary. Why
B19 0350 do we need bigger and better bombs? I repeat, two wrongs do not
B19 0360 make a right. @ #'WE TREMBLE NOT'# _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 0370 Everyone should take time to read Martin Luther's Hymn
B19 0380 "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God".   Especially the
B19 0390 first half of the third verse: @ @ #OUT OF THE RACE# _TO
B19 0400 THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ To our everlasting shame, we led the
B19 0410 world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the
B19 0420 first bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   Having led the world
B19 0430 in this mad race I pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead
B19 0440 it out of the race.   Are we to be the master of the atom, or
B19 0450 will the atom be our master- and destroy us! @ #WHY TRUST JAGAN?#
B19 0460 _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ Just because Cheddi
B19 0470 Jagan, new boss of British Guiana, was educated in the United States
B19 0480 is no reason to think he isn't a Red. We have quite a few home-grown
B19 0490 specimens of our own. If we go all gooey over this newest Castro
B19 0500 (until he proves he isn't) we've got rocks in our heads. How
B19 0510 many times must we get burned before we learn? @ #RUSSIA AND U&N&#
B19 0520 _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ Just to remind the Communists
B19 0530 that the bombs dropped on Japan were to end a war not start
B19 0540 one. The war could have continued many years with many thousands killed
B19 0550 on both sides. Intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets
B19 0560 of destruction are frightening whether they fall on Japan, London
B19 0570 or Pearl Harbor. That is why the United Nations was formed so that
B19 0580 intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet
B19 0590 and solve problems without resorting to war.   Russia has showed
B19 0600 its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the
B19 0610 world. Why aren't the Soviets expelled from the U&N&? @
B19 0620 #BELATED TRIBUTE# _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ While
B19 0630 "better late than never" may have certain merits, the posthumous
B19 0640 award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to the late Dag Hammarskjold
B19 0650 strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation. Had
B19 0660 it been bestowed while the Secretary General of the United Nations
B19 0670 was living, unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in
B19 0680 pursuing a difficult and, in many ways, thankless task.   According
B19 0690 to one report, however, Mr& Hammarskjold was considered "too
B19 0700 controversial" a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last
B19 0710 spring. Actually, of course, that label "controversial" applied
B19 0720 only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world
B19 0730 organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the Soviet
B19 0740 Union.   At Khrushchev's door, therefore, can be placed
B19 0750 the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves
B19 0760 to be intimidated. It is well for us to remember that a wreath on a
B19 0770 coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed.
B19 0780 As has happened so often in the past, the ability to recognize
B19 0790 true greatness has been inadequate and tardy. @ #'PEOPLE TO PEOPLE'#
B19 0800 _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ Just a brief note of
B19 0810 appreciation to Vice President Johnson and Pakistani camel driver
B19 0820 Bashir Ahmad for providing a first-class example of "people to people"
B19 0830 good will. If only this could be done more often- with such
B19 0840 heartening results- many of the earth's "big problems" would
B19 0850 shrink to the insignificances they really are.   P& S&. Thanks
B19 0860 for your good coverage of Ahmad's visit, too! @ #EXPRESSWAY
B19 0870 ANSWER: EAST RIVER DRIVE# _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 0880 Your continuing editorials concerning the Schuylkill Expressway
B19 0890 are valuable; however, several pertinent considerations deserve recognition.
B19 0900    One of the problems associated with the expressway
B19 0910 stems from the basic idea. We shuffle a large percentage of the cars
B19 0920 across the river twice. They start on the East side of the Schuylkill,
B19 0930 have to cross over to the West to use the expressway and cross over
B19 0940 again to the East at their destination. Bridges, tunnels and ferries
B19 0950 are the most common methods of river crossings. Each one of these
B19 0960 is, by its nature, a focal point or a point of natural congestion. We
B19 0970 should avoid these congestion points or, putting it another way, keep
B19 0980 cars starting and ending on the East side of the river- on the East
B19 0990 side.   This can be accomplished by several logical steps:
B19 1000 _(1)_ Widen the East River Drive at least one lane. _(2)_
B19 1010 So widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage
B19 1020 problems. _(3)_ Paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead
B19 1030 directional lights as on our bridges. One additional lane would then
B19 1040 be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the
B19 1050 traffic carrying capability of the East River Drive by fifty percent.
B19 1060 _(4)_ This could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures
B19 1070 necessitated by the Schuylkill Expressway and without destroying
B19 1080 the natural beauty of the East River Drive. @ #SHADOW OVER
B19 1090 WASHINGTON SQUARE# _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ I wish
B19 1100 to advocate two drastic changes in Washington Square: _1._ Take
B19 1110 away George Washington's statue. _2._ Replace it with the
B19 1120 statue of one or another of the world's famous dictators.   There's
B19 1130 no sense in being reminded of times that were. Washington Square seems
B19 1140 not part of a free land. It may remind one of Russia, China or
B19 1150 East Berlin; but it can't remind one of the freedom that Washington
B19 1160 and the Continental soldiers fought for.   The Fairmount
B19 1170 Park Commission will no doubt approve my two proposals, because it
B19 1180 is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the Square.
B19 1190 The matter may seem a small thing to some people, I know, but it's
B19 1200 a very good start on the road to Totalitarianism **h The Commission
B19 1210 has posted signs in Washington Square saying:   {The
B19 1220 Feeding of Birds is Prohibited in This Square.}   <Fairmount
B19 1230 Park Commission>   Does each tentacle of the octopus of
B19 1240 City Government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers
B19 1250 an annoyance? If birds don't belong in a Square or Park, what
B19 1260 does? They are the most beautiful part of that little piece of Nature.
B19 1270 The trees are their homes; but the Commission does not share
B19 1280 such sentiments.   The whole official City apparently has an
B19 1290 intense hatred toward birds. Starlings and blackbirds are scared off
B19 1300 by cannon, from City Hall. Just a preliminary measure. If any are
B19 1310 left, presently, we may expect to see signs specifically {PROHIBITING}
B19 1320 the feeding of them too.   The City Government is not
B19 1330 united in an all-out, to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs, delinquents,
B19 1340 thugs, murderers, rapists, subversives. Indeed no. Let every
B19 1350 policeman and park guard keep his eye on John and Jane Doe, lest one
B19 1360 piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive.   Of
B19 1370 course, in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and
B19 1380 innocent and dependent creatures die because we're afraid to feed them
B19 1390 and afraid to protest and say "How come? What's your motive?
B19 1400 {WHO} wants this deed done"?- in this small way do
B19 1410 the leaders of a city, or of a nation, iniure the masses to watching,
B19 1420 or even inflicting, torture and death, upon even their fellow men.
B19 1430    One means to help the birds occurs to me: Let the chimes that
B19 1440 ring over Washington Square twice daily, discontinue any piece of music
B19 1450 but one. Let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody
B19 1460 has been the joy of mankind since time began, the hymn "Abide With
B19 1470 Me". We will know, and He will know, to whom it is rendered, what
B19 1480 the birds would ask: @ @ #NOT PUSH-UPS BUT STAND-UPS# _TO
B19 1490 THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ There is a trend today to bemoan
B19 1500 the fact that Americans are too "soft". Unfortunately, those who
B19 1510 would remedy our "softness" seek to do so with calisthenics. They
B19 1520 are working on the wrong part of our anatomy. It is not our bodies
B19 1530 but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft. Ashamed of our wealth
B19 1540 and power, afraid of so-called world opinion and addicted to peace,
B19 1550 we have allowed our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed policies.
B19 1560    When we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which
B19 1570 we know to be right, when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations
B19 1580 which do not permit self-determination, when we become strong enough
B19 1590 to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own Nation, when
B19 1600 we recognize that our enemy is Communism not war, and when we realize
B19 1610 that concessions to Communists do not insure peace or freedom, then,
B19 1620 and only then will we no longer be "soft". America doesn't need
B19 1630 to "push-up", she needs to stand up! @
B19 1640 #DISPUTES STANS COLUMN BUSINESS SCANDAL VIEWS# _TO THE EDITOR:_
B19 1650 The new column by Maurice Stans regarding business scandals, is
B19 1660 fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has
B19 1670 some merit. However, he states unequivocally "the scandals in business
B19 1680 are far less significant than the scandals in labor". I must,
B19 1690 in fairness, take issue with his premise, primarily because the so-called
B19 1700 scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals.
B19 1710    The area most prominently commented on during the McClellan
B19 1720 hearings had to do with "sweetheart contracts". These arrangements
B19 1730 would have been impossible if the business community was truly
B19 1740 interested in the welfare of its employes. A sweetheart arrangement
B19 1750 can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous
B19 1760 labor leaders demanding tribute. Anyone familiar with the details
B19 1770 of the McClellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart
B19 1780 arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented
B19 1790 the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders.   Further, it
B19 1800 should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by Congress
B19 1810 to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the
B19 1820 Landrum-Griffin Act.
B20 0010 #ESCALATION UNTO DEATH# The nuclear war is already being fought,
B20 0020 except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets- not yet.
B20 0030 It is being fought, moreover, in fairly close correspondence with
B20 0040 the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories. They predicted
B20 0050 escalation, and escalation is what we are getting. The biggest nuclear
B20 0060 device the United States has exploded measured some 15 megatons,
B20 0070 although our ~B-52s are said to be carrying two 20-megaton bombs
B20 0080 apiece. Some time ago, however, Mr& Khrushchev decided that when
B20 0090 bigger bombs were made, the Soviet Union would make them. He seems
B20 0100 to have at least a few 30- and 50-megaton bombs on hand, since we cannot
B20 0110 assume that he has exploded his entire stock. And now, of course,
B20 0120 the hue and cry for counter-escalation is being raised on our side.
B20 0130 Khrushchev threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb? So be it- then
B20 0140 we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs of the common
B20 0150 or hydrogen variety, and neutron bombs, which do not exist but are said
B20 0160 to be the coming thing. So escalation proceeds, ad infinitum or, more
B20 0170 accurately, until the contestants begin dropping them on each other
B20 0180 instead of on their respective proving grounds.   What is needed,
B20 0190 Philip Morrison writes in <The Cornell Daily Sun> (October
B20 0200 26) is a discontinuity. The escalation must end sometime, and probably
B20 0210 quite soon. "Only a discontinuity can end it", Professor Morrison
B20 0220 writes. "The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction,
B20 0230 or that of diplomatic policy".   Morrison points out
B20 0240 that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet Union or Red
B20 0250 China, it is the most vulnerable of the great powers- Europe of
B20 0260 course must be written off out of hand. He feels, therefore, that to
B20 0270 seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the United States is the
B20 0280 least risky path our government can take. His proposal is opposed to
B20 0290 that of Richard Nixon, Governor Rockefeller, past chairmen Strauss
B20 0300 and McCone of the Atomic Energy Commission, Dr& Edward Teller
B20 0310 and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation
B20 0320 of the cold war. These gentlemen are calling for a resumption
B20 0330 of testing- in the atmosphere- on the greatest possible scale, all
B20 0340 in the name of national security. Escalation is their first love and
B20 0350 their last; they will be faithful unto death.   Capable as their
B20 0360 minds may be in some directions, these guardians of the nation's
B20 0370 security are incapable of learning, or even of observing. If this capacity
B20 0380 had not failed them, they would see that their enemy has made a
B20 0390 disastrous miscalculation. He has gained only one thing- he has exploded
B20 0400 a 50-megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust
B20 0410 to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges. But if his
B20 0420 purpose was to inspire terror, his action could hardly have miscarried
B20 0430 more obviously. Not terror, but anger and resentment have been the
B20 0435 general
B20 0440 reaction outside the Soviet sphere.   Khrushchev himself is
B20 0450 reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused, yet
B20 0460 our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his
B20 0470 footsteps. When one powerful nation strives to emulate the success
B20 0480 of another, it is only natural. Thus, when the Russians sent up their
B20 0490 first sputnik, American chagrin was human enough, and American determination
B20 0500 to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable.
B20 0510 But to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of
B20 0520 his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly. #THE TIDE TURNS#
B20 0530 When East Germans fled to the West by the thousands, paeans of
B20 0540 joy rose from the throats of Western publicists. They are less vocal
B20 0550 now, when it is the West Berliners who are migrating. The flood
B20 0560 is not as great- only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative
B20 0570 account- but it is symptomatic. West Berlin morale is low and,
B20 0580 in age distribution, the situation is unfavorable. Nearly 18 per cent
B20 0590 of West Berlin's 2,200,000 residents are sixty-five or older,
B20 0600 only 12.8 per cent are under fifteen.   R& H& S& Crossman,
B20 0610 M&P&, writing in <The Manchester Guardian>, states that
B20 0620 departures from West Berlin are now running at the rate not of 700,
B20 0630 but of 1,700 a week, and applications to leave have risen to 1,900 a
B20 0640 week. The official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers
B20 0650 or independent professional people. Whole families are moving and
B20 0660 removal firms are booked for months ahead. The weekly loss is partly
B20 0670 counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from West Germany, but the
B20 0680 hard truth, says Crossman, is that "The closing off of East Berlin
B20 0690 without interference from the West and with the use only of East
B20 0700 German, as distinct from Russian, troops was a major Communist victory,
B20 0710 which dealt West Berlin a deadly, possibly a fatal, blow. The
B20 0720 gallant half-city is dying on its feet".   Another piece of
B20 0730 evidence appears in a dispatch from Bonn in the <Observer> (London).
B20 0740 Mark Arnold-Foster writes: "People are leaving [West Berlin]
B20 0750 because they think it is dying. They are leaving so fast that
B20 0760 the president of the West German Employers' Federation issued an
B20 0770 appeal this week to factory workers in the West to volunteer for six
B20 0780 months' front-line work in factories in West Berlin. Berlin's
B20 0790 resilience is amazing, but if it has to hire its labor in the West the
B20 0800 struggle will be hard indeed".   The handwriting is on the wall.
B20 0810 The only hope for West Berlin lies in a compromise which will
B20 0820 bring down the wall and reunite the city. State Department officials
B20 0830 refusing to show their passes at the boundary, and driving two blocks
B20 0840 into East Berlin under military escort, will not avail. Tanks lined
B20 0850 up at the border will be no more helpful. The materials for compromise
B20 0860 are at hand: <The Nation>, Walter Lippmann and other sober
B20 0870 commentators (see Alan Clark on p& 367) have spelled them out again
B20 0880 and again. A compromise will leave both sides without the glow of
B20 0890 triumph, but it will save Berlin. Or the city can be a graveyard monument
B20 0900 to Western intransigence, if that is what the West wants. #VACANCY#
B20 0910 The removal of Stalin's body from the mausoleum he shared
B20 0920 with Lenin to less distinguished quarters in the Kremlin wall is not
B20 0930 unprecedented in history. It is, in fact, a relatively mild chastisement
B20 0940 of the dead. A British writer, Richard Haestier, in a book,
B20 0950 <Dead Men Tell Tales>, recalls that in the turmoil preceding
B20 0960 the French Revolution the body of Henry /4,, who had died nearly
B20 0970 180 years earlier, was torn to pieces by a mob. And in England, after
B20 0980 the Restoration, the body of Cromwell was disinterred and hanged at
B20 0990 Tyburn. The head was then fixed on a pole at Westminster, and the
B20 1000 rest of the body was buried under the gallows.   Contemplating
B20 1010 these posthumous punishments, Stalin should not lose all hope. In 1899,
B20 1020 Parliament erected a statue to Cromwell in Westminster, facing
B20 1030 Whitehall and there, presumably, he still stands. Nikita Khrushchev,
B20 1040 however, has created yet another problem for himself. The Lenin tomb
B20 1050 is obviously adequate for double occupancy, Moscow is a crowded city,
B20 1060 and the creed of communism deplores waste. Who will take Stalin's
B20 1070 place beside Lenin? There is Karl Marx, of course, buried in
B20 1080 London.
B20 1090 The Macmillan government might be willing to let him go, but he has
B20 1100 been dead seventy-eight years and even the Soviet morticians could
B20 1110 not make him look presentable. Who, then, is of sufficient stature to
B20 1120 lodge with Lenin? Who but Nikita himself? Since he has just
B20 1130 shown who is top dog, he may not be ready to receive this highest honor
B20 1140 in the gift of the Soviet people. Besides, he can hardly avoid musing
B20 1150 on the instability of death which, what with exhumations and rehabilitations,
B20 1160 seems to match that of life. Suppose he did lie beside Lenin,
B20 1170 would it be permanent? If some future Khrushchev decided to
B20 1180 rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor, would not the factory
B20 1190 workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession? When
B20 1200 a man is laid to rest, he is entitled to stay put. If Nikita buys
B20 1210 a small plot in some modest rural cemetery, everyone will understand.
B20 1220 #U THANT OF BURMA# The appointment of U Thant of Burma as the
B20 1230 U&N&'s Acting Secretary General- at this writing, the choice
B20 1240 appears to be certain- offers further proof that in politics
B20 1250 it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential
B20 1260 friends. Mongi Slim of Tunisia and Frederick Boland of Ireland
B20 1270 were early
B20 1280 favorites in the running, but France didn't like the
B20 1290 former and the Soviet Union would have none of the latter. With the
B20 1300 neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed
B20 1310 Mr&
B20 1320 Hammarskjold, U Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely
B20 1330 to be waylaid by a veto. What is interesting is that his positive
B20 1340 qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to
B20 1350 his candidacy. In all the bitter in-fighting, the squabbles over election
B20 1360 procedures, the complicated numbers game that East and West played
B20 1370 on the assistant secretaries' theme, the gentleman from Burma showed
B20 1380 himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat. He has,
B20 1390 moreover, another qualification which augurs well for the future.
B20 1400 He is a Buddhist, which means that to him peace and the sanctity of
B20 1410 human life are not only religious dogma, but a profound and unshakable
B20 1420 <Weltanschauung>.   U Thant of course, will hold office until
B20 1430 the spring of 1963, when Mr& Hammarskjold's term would have come
B20 1440 to an end. Whether the compromises- on both sides- that made
B20 1450 possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen.
B20 1460 Mr& Khrushchev's demand for a <troika> is dormant, not dead;
B20 1470 the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism
B20 1480 that U Thant represents. In a sense, the showdown promised by Mr&
B20 1490 Hammarskjold's sudden and tragic death has been avoided; no precedents
B20 1500 have been set as yet; structurally, the U&N& is still
B20 1510 fluid, vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership
B20 1520 are bringing to bear upon it. But at least the pessimists who believed
B20 1530 that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane
B20 1540 crash in the Congo have been proved wrong. #TO THE HILLS, GIRLS#
B20 1550 No one who has studied the radical Right can suppose that words are
B20 1560 their sole staple in trade. These are mentalities which crave action-
B20 1570 and they are beginning to get it, as Messrs& Salsich and Engh
B20 1580 report on page 372. Even in areas where political connotations are
B20 1590 (deliberately?) left vague, the spirit of vigilantism is spreading.
B20 1600 <Friends>, a picture magazine distributed by Chevrolet dealers, describes
B20 1610 a paramilitary organization of employees of the Gulf Telephone
B20 1620 Company at Foley, Alabama. "If the day should ever come that
B20 1630 foreign invaders swarm ashore along the Gulf Coast", the account reads,
B20 1640 "they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando-trained
B20 1650 telephone employees- all girls. **h Heavily armed and mobilized
B20 1660 as a fast-moving Civil Defense outfit, 23 operators and office
B20 1670 personnel **h stand ready to move into action at a minute's notice".
B20 1680 According to <Friends>, the unit was organized by John Snook,
B20 1690 a former World War /2, commando who is vice president and general
B20 1700 manager of the telephone company. The girls, very fetching in their
B20 1710 uniforms, are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck;
B20 1720 they are also trained with carbines, automatic weapons, pistols,
B20 1730 rifles and other such ladies' accessories.   This may be <opera
B20 1740 bouffe> now, but it will become more serious should the cold war
B20 1750 mount in frenzy. The country is committed to the doctrine of security
B20 1760 by military means. The doctrine has never worked; it is not working
B20 1770 now. The official military establishment can only threaten to use
B20 1780 its nuclear arms; it cannot bring them into actual play. A more dangerous
B20 1790 formula for national frustration cannot be imagined. As the civic
B20 1800 temper rises, the more naive citizens begin to play soldier- but
B20 1810 the guns are real. Soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they
B20 1820 are assured are in our midst.
B21 0010 All false gods resemble Moloch, at least in the early phases of their
B21 0020 careers, so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship
B21 0030 to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice.
B21 0040 But there is reason in all things, and in this country the heathenish
B21 0050 cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands. The annual
B21 0060 butchery of 40,000 American men, women and children to satiate
B21 0070 its blood-lust is excessive; a quota of 25,000 a year would be more
B21 0080 than sufficient.   No other popular idol is accorded even that much
B21 0090 grace. If the railroads, for example, regularly slaughtered 25,000
B21 0100 passengers each year, the high priests of the cult would have cause
B21 0110 to tremble for their personal safety, for such a holocaust would excite
B21 0120 demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the United States.
B21 0130 But by comparison with the railroad, the motor car is a relatively
B21 0140 new object of popular worship, so it is too much to hope that it
B21 0150 may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily.
B21 0160    Yet it is plainly time to make a start, and to be effective
B21 0170 the first move should be highly dramatic, without being fanatical. Here,
B21 0180 then, is what Swift would have called a modest proposal by way of
B21 0190 a beginning. From next New Year's Day let us keep careful account
B21 0200 of each successive fatality on the highways, publicizing it on all
B21 0210 media of communication. To avoid suspicion of bigotry, let the hand
B21 0220 of vengeance be stayed until the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five
B21 0230 thousandth corpse; but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery
B21 0240 be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners.
B21 0250    Then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution
B21 0260 on July 4, 1963. The scene, of course, should be nine miles northwest
B21 0270 of Centralia, Illinois, the geographical center of population according
B21 0280 to the census. A special grandstand, protected by awnings from
B21 0290 the midsummer sun of Illinois, should be erected for occupancy by
B21 0300 honored guests, who should include the ambassadors of all those new African
B21 0310 nations as yet not quite convinced that the United States is
B21 0320 thoroughly civilized. The band should play the Rogues' March as a
B21 0330 processional, switching to "Hail Columbia, Happy Land"! as
B21 0340 the trap is sprung.   Independence Day is the appropriate date
B21 0350 as a symbolical reminder of the American article of faith that governments
B21 0360 are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable
B21 0370 rights, the first of which is life, and when any government becomes subversive
B21 0380 of that end, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish
B21 0390 it. The highway system is an agency of government, and when it grinds
B21 0400 up 40,000 Americans every year the government is destroying its own
B21 0410 taxpayers, which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do.
B21 0420    Hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government,
B21 0430 but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual
B21 0440 citizens, which would certainly alter it, and definitely for
B21 0450 the better. Moreover, the salubrious effects would not be exclusively
B21 0460 political, but at least partially, and perhaps primarily social. It
B21 0470 would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some
B21 0480 of its ancillary beliefs and practices- for instance, the doctrine
B21 0490 that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon,
B21 0500 not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the
B21 0510 cardinal sin of stasis, or, as it is generally termed, staying put.
B21 0520    True, the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor,
B21 0530 even a miniscule sect, and their credo, "Home-keeping hearts are
B21 0540 happiest", is as disreputable as Socinianism. Nonetheless, although
B21 0550 few in number they are a stubborn crew, as tenacious of life as the
B21 0560 Hardshell Baptists, which suggests that there is some kind of vital
B21 0570 principle embodied in their faith. Perhaps there is more truth than we
B21 0580 are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of Tarheelia,
B21 0590 Robert Ruark's grandfather, who was persuaded that the great curse
B21 0600 of the modern world is "all this gallivantin'".   In any
B21 0610 event, the yearly sacrifice of 40,000 victims is a hecatomb too large
B21 0620 to be justified by the most ardent faith. Somehow our contemporary Moloch
B21 0630 must be induced to see reason. Since appeals to morality, to humanity,
B21 0640 and to sanity have had such small effect, perhaps our last recourse
B21 0650 is the deterrent example. If we make it established custom that
B21 0660 whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive, say beyond 25,000
B21 0670 <per annum>, then <somebody> is going to hang, it follows that the
B21 0680 more eminent the victim, the more impressive the lesson. To hang 50
B21 0690 Governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related
B21 0700 to the highways; so, all things considered, the highway commissioners
B21 0710 would seem to be elected.
B21 0720 As the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly
B21 0730 around the earth, the Soviet Union stands guilty of a monstrous crime
B21 0740 against the human race. But the guilt is shared by the United States,
B21 0750 Britain and France, the other members of the atomic club. Until
B21 0760 Moscow resumed nuclear testing last September 1, the ~US and
B21 0770 ~UK had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere
B21 0780 as the Russians, and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still
B21 0790 coming down. As it descends, the concentration of radioactivity builds
B21 0800 up in the human body; for a dose of radiation is not like a flu
B21 0810 virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies. The effect of
B21 0820 radiation is cumulative over the years- and on to succeeding generations.
B21 0830 So, while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning, history
B21 0840 is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the
B21 0850 West were so quick to assume when Mr& Khrushchev made his cynical
B21 0860 and irresponsible threat. Shock, dismay and foreboding for future
B21 0870 generations were legitimate reactions; a holier-than-thou sermon was
B21 0880 not.   On October 19, after the Soviets had detonated at least
B21 0890 20 nuclear devices, Ambassador Stevenson warned the ~UN General
B21 0900 Assembly that this country, in "self protection", might have
B21 0910 to resume above-ground tests. More recently, the chairman of the Atomic
B21 0920 Energy Commission, Dr& Glenn T& Seaborg, "admitted"
B21 0930 to a news conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, that the ~US might
B21 0940 fall behind Russia (he apparently meant in weapons development) if the
B21 0950 Soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain. The
B21 0960 trial balloons are afloat.   All of which makes it more imperative
B21 0970 than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood.
B21 0980 But for the average citizen, unfortunately, this is one of science's
B21 0990 worst-marked channels, full of tricky currents and unknown
B21 1000 depths. The scientists, in and out of government, do not agree on some
B21 1010 of the most vital points, at least publicly. On the one hand, the Public
B21 1020 Health Service declared as recently as October 26 that present
B21 1030 radiation levels resulting from the Soviet shots "do not warrant
B21 1040 undue public concern" or any action to limit the intake of radioactive
B21 1050 substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the
B21 1060 ~US. But the ~PHS conceded that the new radioactive particles
B21 1070 "will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations,
B21 1080 and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the United
B21 1090 States". Then it added: "It is not possible to determine
B21 1100 how extensive these ill effects will be- nor how many people will
B21 1110 be affected".   Having hedged its bets in this way, ~PHS
B21 1120 apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination
B21 1130 after all: "At present radiation levels, and even at somewhat
B21 1140 higher levels, the additional risk is slight and very few people will
B21 1150 be affected". Then, to conclude on an indeterminate note: "Nevertheless,
B21 1160 if fallout increased substantially, or remained high for
B21 1170 a long time, it would become far more important as a potential health
B21 1180 hazard in this country and throughout the world".   Dr& Linus
B21 1190 Pauling, a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, has been less ambiguous,
B21 1200 whether you choose to agree with him or not. After declaring, in
B21 1210 an article last month in <Frontier> magazine, that the Russian testing
B21 1220 "carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences
B21 1230 of any action in the history of the world", he gave this estimate
B21 1240 of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new Soviet shots totaled
B21 1250 200 megatons:   The damage to human germ plasm would be
B21 1260 such that in the next few generations 160,000 children around the world
B21 1270 would be born with gross physical or mental defects. Long-lived carbon-14
B21 1280 from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic, neonatal
B21 1290 or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations,
B21 1300 and between 200,000 and one million human beings now living would have
B21 1310 their lives cut short by radiation-produced diseases such as leukemia.
B21 1320 Most of these would be in the Northern Hemisphere, where the fallout
B21 1330 is concentrating. Pauling's estimate of 200 megatons yield from
B21 1340 the present series of Russian tests will probably turn out to be
B21 1350 too high, but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility.
B21 1360    The lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due
B21 1370 in part to insufficient data covering large population groups, from
B21 1380 which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn. But more than one conscientious
B21 1390 researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion
B21 1400 of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout
B21 1410 has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem. Its
B21 1420 dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe
B21 1430 national security requires further testing. An illustration of this
B21 1440 attitude is found in John A& McCone's letter to Dr& Thomas
B21 1450 Lauritsen, reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of <The New
B21 1460 Republic>.   To this day the Atomic Energy Commission shies
B21 1470 away from discussing the health aspects of fallout. A recent study
B21 1480 on radiation exposure by the ~AEC's division of biology and
B21 1490 medicine stated: "The question of the biological effect **h of [radiation]
B21 1500 doses is not considered" herein. Of course, the ~AEC
B21 1510 is in a bind now. If it comes down too hard on the potential dangers
B21 1520 of fallout, it will box the President on resuming atmospheric tests.
B21 1530 So the Commission's announcements of the new Soviet shots have
B21 1540 been confined to one or two bleak sentences, with the fission yield usually
B21 1550 left vague.   Now, of course, that the Russians are the
B21 1560 nuclear villains, radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid-1950s,
B21 1570 when the ~US was testing in the atmosphere. The prevailing
B21 1580 official attitude then seemed to be that fallout, if not exactly good
B21 1590 for you, might not be much worse than a bad cold. After a nuclear blast,
B21 1600 one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days, about all you had
B21 1610 to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof. Things
B21 1620 aren't that simple anymore. Yet if Washington gets too indignant
B21 1630 about Soviet fallout, it will have to do a lot of fast footwork
B21 1640 if America decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count.
B21 1650 #HOW MUCH FALLOUT WILL WE GET?# As of October 25, the ~AEC
B21 1660 had reported 24 shots in the new Soviet series, 12 of them in a megaton
B21 1670 range, including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons
B21 1680 (the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of ~TNT); and
B21 1700 President Kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported.
B21 1710    Assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot
B21 1720 estimated by the Japanese at 10 megatons, a conservative computation
B21 1730 is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60
B21 1740 megatons. Some government scientists say privately that the figure
B21 1750 probably is closer to 80 megatons, and that the full 50-megaton bomb
B21 1760 that Khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated.   If the new
B21 1770 Soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous Russian
B21 1780 tests, the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion, meaning a
B21 1790 fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus far. To this must be added the
B21 1800 90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the
B21 1810 atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that
B21 1820 began in November, 1958.
B22 0010 #RESUMING ATMOSPHERIC TESTS# ONE OF THE inescapable realities
B22 0020 of the Cold War is that is has thrust upon the West a wholly new
B22 0030 and historically unique set of moral dilemmas. The first dilemma was
B22 0040 the morality of nuclear warfare itself. That dilemma is as much with
B22 0050 us as ever. The second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear
B22 0060 testing, a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present
B22 0070 series of Soviet tests.   When this second dilemma first
B22 0075 became
B22 0080 obvious- during the mid to late '50's- the United States
B22 0090 appeared to have three choices. It could have unilaterally abandoned
B22 0100 further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations.
B22 0110 It could have continued testing to the full on the grounds
B22 0120 that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of Communist
B22 0130 world domination. Or it could have chosen to find- by negotiation-
B22 0140 some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security. This
B22 0150 third choice was in fact made.   With the resumption of Soviet
B22 0160 testing and their intransigence at the Geneva talks, however, the
B22 0170 hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken. Once
B22 0180 again, the United States must choose. And once again, the
B22 0190 choices
B22 0200 are much the same. Only this time around the conditions are different
B22 0210 and the choice is far harder.   The first choice, abandoning tests
B22 0220 entirely, would not only be unpopular domestically, but would surely
B22 0230 be exploited by the Russians. The second choice, full testing, has
B22 0240 become even more risky just because the current Soviet tests have
B22 0250 already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere. The third choice, negotiation,
B22 0260 presupposes, as Russian behavior demonstrates, a great deal
B22 0270 of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable.   We take the
B22 0280 position, however, that the third choice still remains the only sane
B22 0290 one open to us. It is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice
B22 0300 and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable.
B22 0310 Its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice; one which, should
B22 0320 it fail, will not have contaminated the conscience. That is the
B22 0330 contamination we most fear. ## LEAVING ASIDE the choice of unilateral
B22 0340 cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral, the question
B22 0350 must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part
B22 0360 would not be a good choice. For that is the one an increasingly large
B22 0370 number of prominent Americans are now proposing. In particular, Governor
B22 0380 Nelson Rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as
B22 0390 anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests.   Speaking
B22 0400 recently in Miami, Governor Rockefeller said that "to assure
B22 0410 the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent Soviet
B22 0420 tests, we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests".
B22 0430 Taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be
B22 0440 unpopular in world opinion, he argued that the responsibility of the United
B22 0450 States is "to do, confidently and firmly, not what is popular,
B22 0460 but what is right".   What was missing in the Governor's
B22 0470 argument, as in so many similar arguments, was a premise which would
B22 0480 enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable
B22 0490 to what is right. The possibility, as he asserted, that the Russians
B22 0500 may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests
B22 0510 does not supply the needed ethical premise- unless, of course, we have
B22 0520 unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken
B22 0530 as a moral demand.   Besides the lack of an adequate ethical
B22 0540 dimension to the Governor's case, one can ask seriously whether our
B22 0550 lead over the Russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons
B22 0560 is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary. Recent statements
B22 0570 by the President and Defense Department spokesmen have, to the
B22 0580 contrary, assured us that our lead is very great. Unless the Administration
B22 0590 and the Defense Department have been deceiving us, the facts
B22 0600 do not support the assertion that we are "compelled" to resume atmospheric
B22 0610 testing.   It is perfectly conceivable that a resumption
B22 0620 of atmospheric tests may, at some point in the future, be necessary
B22 0630 and even justifiable. But a resumption does not seem justifiable now.
B22 0640 What we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination
B22 0650 of the atmosphere by the Soviet tests has radically increased our
B22 0660 own moral obligations. We now have to think not only of our national
B22 0670 security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests
B22 0680 we might undertake. This is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded
B22 0690 or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even
B22 0700 of the evil of Communism.   Too often in the past Russian
B22 0710 tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part. There ought
B22 0720 to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless
B22 0730 of what Russia does. The refusal to resume atmospheric testing
B22 0740 would be a good start. #ECUMENICAL HOPES# WHEN HIS Holiness
B22 0750 Pope John /23, first called for an Ecumenical Council, and at the
B22 0760 same time voiced his yearning for Christian unity, the enthusiasm
B22 0770 among Catholic and Protestant ecumenicists was immediate. With good
B22 0780 reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided Christendom. But
B22 0790 as the more concrete plans for the work of the Council gradually became
B22 0800 known, there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides.
B22 0810 The Council we now know will concern itself directly only with
B22 0820 the internal affairs of the Church.   As it has turned out, however,
B22 0830 the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of
B22 0840 hope in the second were both wrong responses. Two things have happened
B22 0850 in recent months to bring the Council into perspective: each provides
B22 0860 a basis for renewed hope and joy.   First of all, it is now
B22 0870 known that Pope John sees the renewal and purification of the Church
B22 0880 as an absolutely necessary step toward Christian unity. Far from
B22 0890 being irrelevant to the ecumenical task, the Pontiff believes that a
B22 0900 revivified Church is required in order that the whole world may see Catholicism
B22 0910 in the best possible light. Equally significant, Pope John
B22 0920 has said that Catholics themselves bear some responsibility for Christian
B22 0930 disunity. A major aim of the Council will be to remove as
B22 0940 far as possible whatever in the Church today stands in the way of unity.
B22 0950    Secondly, a whole series of addresses and actions by the
B22 0960 Pope and by others show that concern for Christian unity is still very
B22 0970 much alive and growing within the Church. The establishment, by the
B22 0980 Holy Father, of a permanent Secretariat for Christian Unity in
B22 0990 1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern. The designation of
B22 1000 five Catholic theologians to attend the World Council of Churches
B22 1010 assembly in New Delhi as "official" observers reverses the Church's
B22 1020 earlier stand. The public appeal by the new Vatican Secretary
B22 1030 of State, Cardinal Cicognani, for renewed efforts toward Eastern
B22 1040 and Western reunion was still another remarkable act. Nor can one
B22 1050 forget Pope John's unprecedented meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury.
B22 1060    Augustin Cardinal Bea, the director of the Secretariate
B22 1070 for Christian Unity, has expressed as directly as anyone the
B22 1080 new spirit that pervades the Church's stance toward the Protestant
B22 1090 and Orthodox Churches. Noting all the difficulties that stand in
B22 1100 the way of reunion, he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone.
B22 1110 For discouragement, or the temptation to abandon our efforts, "would
B22 1120 show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without
B22 1130 thinking of the omnipotence of God, the irresistible efficacy of
B22 1140 prayer, the action of Christ or the power of the Divine Spirit".
B22 1150 Can any Christian fail to respond to these words? #THE BUDGET DEFICIT#
B22 1160 THE ADMINISTRATION'S official budget review, which estimates
B22 1170 a 6.9 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year, isn't
B22 1180 making anyone happy. Certainly it isn't making the President happy,
B22 1190 and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget
B22 1200 got into its unbalanced condition, how he intends to economize wherever
B22 1210 he can and how he hopes to do better next year.   We sympathize
B22 1220 with Mr& Kennedy, but we feel bound to say that his budget review
B22 1230 doesn't please us either, although for very different reasons.
B22 1240 Furthermore, we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying
B22 1250 than reassuring.   In the first place, a large part of the
B22 1260 discrepancy between President Eisenhower's estimate of a 1.5 billion
B22 1270 dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost
B22 1280 seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing President's
B22 1290 farewell gift of a political booby-trap to his successor. The Eisenhower
B22 1300 budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and
B22 1310 yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received.   The
B22 1320 rest of the deficit is also easily understood. Four billion dollars
B22 1330 of the spending increase is for defense, an expenditure necessitated
B22 1340 by the penny-wise policies of the Eisenhhower Administration, quite
B22 1350 apart from the recent crises in Berlin and elsewhere. Four hundred
B22 1360 million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program, a
B22 1370 responsibility similarly neglected by Mr& Eisenhower. The farm program
B22 1380 will cost an additional 1.5 billion, because of unusual weather
B22 1390 factors, the Food for Peace program and other new measures. Anti-recession
B22 1400 programs- aid for the unemployed, their children and for depressed
B22 1410 areas- account for only 900 million of the 6.9 billion dollar
B22 1420 deficit.   Our complaint is that in many crucial areas the Kennedy
B22 1430 programs are not too large but too small, most seriously in regard
B22 1440 to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures.
B22 1450 And yet Mr& Kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents
B22 1460 of the right with apologies and promises of "tightening up" and
B22 1470 "economizing". We wish the President would remember that "fiscal
B22 1480 responsibility" was the battle-cry of the party that lost the election.
B22 1490 The party that won used to say something about a New Frontier.
B22 1500 #ETHICS AND PEACE# INTRODUCTION of the "dialogue" principle
B22 1510 proved strikingly effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting
B22 1520 of the Catholic Association for International Peace in Washington
B22 1540 the last weekend in October. Two of the principal addresses were delivered
B22 1550 by prominent Protestants, and when the speaker was a Catholic,
B22 1560 one "discussant" on the dais tended to be of another religious
B22 1570 persuasion.   Several effects were immediately evident. Sessions
B22 1580 devoted to "Ethics and Foreign Policy Trends", "Moral Principle
B22 1590 and Political Judgment", "Christian Ethics in the Cold
B22 1600 War" and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this
B22 1610 procedure than if Catholics were merely talking to themselves. Usually
B22 1620 questions from the floor were directed to the non-Catholic speaker
B22 1630 or discussion leader.   In the earlier sessions there was plentiful
B22 1640 discussion on the natural law, which Dr& William V& O'Brien
B22 1650 of Georgetown University, advanced as the basis for widely acceptable
B22 1660 ethical judgments on foreign policy. That Aristotelean-Thomistic
B22 1670 principle experienced a thorough going-over from a number of the
B22 1680 participants, but in the end the concept came to reassert itself. Speakers
B22 1690 declared that Protestants often make use of it, if, perhaps,
B22 1700 by some other name. A Lebanese Moslem told about its existence and
B22 1710 application in the Islamic tradition as the "divine law", while a
B22 1720 C&A&I&P& member who has been working in close association
B22 1730 with delegates of the new U&N& nations told of its widespread recognition
B22 1740 on the African continent. The impression was unmistakable
B22 1750 that, whatever one may choose to call it, natural law is a functioning
B22 1760 generality with a certain objective existence.   Another question
B22 1770 that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself. The stimulus from
B22 1780 the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences
B22 1790 was undeniable. It was expected that the comparison of different
B22 1800 approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other's
B22 1810 positions and better comprehension of one's own. But a realization
B22 1820 that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed,
B22 1830 and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions
B22 1840 to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political
B22 1850 issues.   One effect of the spirited give-and-take of these
B22 1860 discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity
B22 1870 of being armed with the facts: knowledge of the destructive
B22 1880 force of even the tiniest "tactical" atomic weapon would have a bearing
B22 1890 on judgments as to the advisability of its use- to defend Berlin,
B22 1900 for example; the pervasive influence of ideology on our political
B22 1910 judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account; it
B22 1920 is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the Christian
B22 1930 imperative.
B23 0010 Everywhere I went in Formosa I asked the same question. I was searching
B23 0020 for an accent of self-delusion or, even, of hypocrisy. I never
B23 0030 found it among any of the Chinese with whom I spoke, though granted
B23 0040 they were, almost all, members of the official family who, presumably,
B23 0050 harbor official thoughts. But I questioned, also, professional soldiers,
B23 0060 who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian's dreamy
B23 0070 irredentism. Their answer was: it can be done, and we will do it.
B23 0080 And then I put the question as pointedly as I could directly to Chiang
B23 0090 Kai-shek: "In America", I said, "practically no one
B23 0100 believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the Mainland. What
B23 0110 evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government
B23 0120 proposes to do just that, and that it can be done"?   He smiled.
B23 0130 (He always smiles- at least at visitors, I gather. He smiled
B23 0140 also at a British bloke seated next to me, who asked the most asinine
B23 0150 questions. I recalled sympathetically the Duke's complaint in Browning's
B23 0160 "My Last Duchess". **h) He smiled, and said a word
B23 0170 or two to the interpreter, who turned to me, "The President wonders
B23 0180 where you are going after you leave Taipei"? That, I smarted,
B23 0190 is a royal rebuff if ever there was one.   I answered the routine
B23 0200 question about my itinerary, rather coolly. Chiang spoke again,
B23 0205 this
B23 0210 time at greater length. "The President says", the translator
B23 0220 came in, "that the reason he asked you where you were going is because
B23 0230 he hoped you would be visiting other areas in Southeast Asia, and
B23 0240 that everywhere you went, you would seek the answer to your question.
B23 0250 He says that if he were to express to you, once again, his own profound
B23 0260 determination to go to the Mainland, and his faith that that return
B23 0270 is feasible, he would merely sound redundant. So you yourself must
B23 0280 seek these objective data, and come to your own conclusions. Any information
B23 0290 we have here in Taiwan is at your disposal".   Fair
B23 0300 enough. What are the relevant data? For every person on Taiwan, there
B23 0310 are sixty in Mainland China. If the raw population figures are
B23 0320 crucially relevant, then it is idle to think of liberation, as idle as
B23 0330 to suppose that Poland might liberate Russia. Relative military manpower?
B23 0340 Less than 60-1, but at least 6-1. The estimates vary widely
B23 0350 on the strength of the Chinese army. Say four million. The armed
B23 0360 forces of Taiwan are at a working strength of about 450,000, though
B23 0370 a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated. Skill? Training?
B23 0380 Morale? It is generally conceded that the Formosan air force
B23 0390 is the best by far in Asia, and the army the best trained. The morale
B23 0400 is very high.   Even so, it adds up to impossible odds, except
B23 0410 that the question arises, On whose side would the Mainland Chinese
B23 0420 army fight?   The miserable people of China, the largest cast
B23 0430 ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play, cannot themselves
B23 0440 resist overtly. They think, perforce, of physical survival:
B23 0450 everything else is secondary. But the army which Mao continues to feed
B23 0460 well, where are its sympathies? The psychological strategists in
B23 0470 Taiwan stress the great sense of family, cultivated in China over
B23 0480 thousands of years. It has not been extirpated by ten years of Communist
B23 0490 depersonalization. Every soldier in the army has, somewhere, relatives
B23 0500 who are close to starvation. The soldiers themselves cannot stage
B23 0510 a successful rebellion, it is assumed: but will their discontent
B23 0520 spread to the officer class? The immediate families of the generals
B23 0530 and the admirals are well fed: a despot does not economize on his
B23 0540 generals. But there are the cousins and aunts and nephews. Their privations
B23 0550 are almost beyond endurance. In behalf of what? Leninism-Marxism,
B23 0560 as understood by Exegete Mao. To whom will the generals stay
B23 0570 loyal? There is little doubt if they had a secret ballot, they
B23 0580 would vote for food for their family, in place of ideological purity out
B23 0590 on the farm. It is another question whether "they"- or a single
B23 0600 general, off in a corner of China, secure for a few (galvanizing?)
B23 0610 days at least from instant retaliation- will defy the Party. But
B23 0620 the disposition to rebel is most definitely there. ## But there
B23 0630 must be a catalytic pressure. The military in Taiwan believe that
B23 0640 the Communists have made two mistakes, which, together, may prove fatal.
B23 0650 The first was the commune program, which will ensure agricultural
B23 0660 poverty for years. The family is largely broken up; and where it
B23 0670 is not, it is left with no residue, and the social meaning of this is
B23 0680 enormous. For it is the family that, in China, has always provided social
B23 0690 security for the indigent, the sick, the down-and-out members of
B23 0700 the clan. Now the government must do that; but the government is
B23 0710 left with no reserve granary, under the agricultural system it has ordained.
B23 0720 Thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of
B23 0730 social security which had traditionally been privately discharged, and
B23 0740 created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems
B23 0750 of social security.   The second mistake is Tibet. Tibet has
B23 0760 historically served China as a buffer state. A friendly state, sometimes
B23 0770 only semi-independent, but never hostile. China never tried to
B23 0780 integrate Tibet by extirpating the people's religion and institutions.
B23 0790 Red China is trying to do this, and she is not likely ever to succeed.
B23 0800 Tibet is too vast, the terrain is too difficult. Tibet may bleed
B23 0810 China as Algeria is bleeding France.   These continuing
B23 0820 pressures, social, economic and military, are doing much to keep China
B23 0830 in a heightening state of tension. The imposition of yet another pressure,
B23 0840 a strong one, from the outside, might cause it to snap. ##
B23 0850 The planners in Taiwan struck me as realistic men. They know that
B23 0860 they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control. First
B23 0870 and foremost, they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the Communist regime.
B23 0880 On these they feel they can rely. Secondly, they depend on America's
B23 0890 "moral cooperation" when the crucial moment arrives. They
B23 0900 hope that if history vouchsafes the West another Budapest, we will
B23 0910 receive the opportunity gladly. I remarked jocularly to the President
B23 0920 that the future of China would be far more certain if he would invite
B23 0930 a planeload of selected American Liberals to Quemoy on an odd
B23 0940 day. He affected (most properly) not to understand my point. But he-
B23 0950 and all of China- wear the scars of American indecisiveness, and
B23 0960 he knows what an uncertain ally we are. We have been grand to Formosa
B23 0970 itself- lots of aid, and, most of the time, a policy of support
B23 0980 for the offshore islands. But our outlook has been, and continues to
B23 0990 be, defensive. A great deal depends on the crystallization of Mr&
B23 1000 Kennedy's views on the world struggle. The Free Chinese know that
B23 1010 the situation on the Mainland is in flux, and are poised to strike.
B23 1020 There is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized
B23 1030 force for liberation.
B23 1040 The moment of truth is the moment of crisis. During the slow buildup,
B23 1050 the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details,
B23 1060 fine words, strutting gestures. The crisis burns these suddenly
B23 1070 away. There the truth is, open to eyes that are willing to look. The
B23 1080 moment passes. New self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked
B23 1090 bones.   A truth-revealing crisis erupted in Katanga for
B23 1100 a couple of days this month, to be quickly smothered by the high pressure
B23 1110 verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies. Before memory,
B23 1120 too, clouds over, let us make a note or two of what could be seen.
B23 1130    The measure was instantly taken, as always in such cases, of
B23 1140 public men at many levels. One knows better, now, who has bone and
B23 1145 who
B23 1150 has jelly in his spine. But I am here concerned more with policy
B23 1160 than with men. Public men come and go but great issues of policy remain.
B23 1170    Now, everyone knows- or knew in the week of December 10-
B23 1180 that something had gone shockingly wrong with American foreign policy.
B23 1190 The United States was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful,
B23 1200 orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most
B23 1210 pro-Western and anti-Communist within any of the new nations-
B23 1220 the only place in Africa, moreover, where a productive relationship
B23 1230 between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved. Of course the
B23 1240 fighting was officially under the auspices of the United Nations. But
B23 1250 in the moment of truth everyone could see that the U&S& was
B23 1260 in reality the principal.   The moment simultaneously revealed that
B23 1270 in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our ~NATO
B23 1280 allies, to the entire Western community. By our policy the West was-
B23 1290 is- split.   But the key revelation is not new. The controlling
B23 1300 pattern was first displayed in the Hungary-Suez crisis of November
B23 1310 1956. It reappears, in whole or part, whenever a new crisis
B23 1320 exposes the reality: in Cuba last spring (with which the Dominican
B23 1330 events of last month should be paired); at the peaks of the nuclear
B23 1340 test and the Berlin cycles; in relation to Laos, Algeria, South
B23 1350 Africa; right now, with almost cartoon emphasis, in the temporally
B23 1360 linked complex of Tshombe-Gizenga-Goa-Ghana. #WHAT THE MOMENTS
B23 1370 REVEAL# This prime element of the truth may be stated as follows:
B23 1380 <Under prevailing policy, the U& S& can take the initiative
B23 1390 against the Right, but cannot take the initiative against the Left>.
B23 1400 It makes no difference what part of the world is involved, what form
B23 1410 of regime, what particular issue. <The U& S& cannot take the
B23 1420 initiative against the Left>. There is even some question whether
B23 1430 the U& S& can any longer <defend> itself against an initiative
B23 1440 by the Left.   We can attack Tshombe, but not Gigenza. No
B23 1450 matter that Gizenga is Moscow's man in the Congo. No matter that
B23 1460 it is his troops who rape Western women and eat Western men. No matter
B23 1470 that the Katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of Western
B23 1480 interests in Africa. (Even granted that the Congo should be
B23 1490 unified, you don't protect Western security by <first> removing
B23 1500 the pro-Western weight from the power equilibrium.)   We can force
B23 1510 Britain and France out of the Suez, but we cannot so much as <try>
B23 1520 to force the Russian tanks back from Budapest. We can mass our
B23 1530 fleet against the Trujillos, but not against the Castros. We can
B23 1540 vote in the ~UN against South African apartheid or Portuguese rule
B23 1550 in Angola, but we cannot even introduce a motion on the Berlin Wall-
B23 1560 much less, give the simple order to push the Wall down. We officially
B23 1570 receive the anti-French, Moscow-allied Algerian
B23 1575 ~FLN,
B23 1580 but we denounce the pro-Europe, anti-Communist ~OAS as criminal.
B23 1590    In the very week of our war against Katanga, we make a $133
B23 1600 million grant to Kwame Nkrumah, who has just declared his solidarity
B23 1610 with the Communist bloc, and is busily turning his own country into
B23 1620 a totalitarian dictatorship. As our planes land the war materiel that
B23 1630 kills pro-Western Katangans, we stand supinely bleating while Nehru's
B23 1640 troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of our ~NATO
B23 1650 ally, Portugal.   What explains this uni-directional paralysis?
B23 1660 It is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes
B23 1670 the frame of our international- and in some degree our domestic-
B23 1680 policy. The Suez-Hungary crisis proves that this system was not
B23 1690 invented by the new Administration, but only made more consistent and
B23 1700 more active. #KEY TO THE PUZZLES# Most immediately relevant to these
B23 1710 episodes in Goa, Katanga and Ghana, as to the Suez-Hungary crisis
B23 1720 before them, is the belief that the main theater of the world drama
B23 1730 is the underdeveloped region of Asia, Africa and Latin America.
B23 1740 From this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy
B23 1750 on the "uncommitted" ("neutralist", "contested") nations,
B23 1760 especially on those whose leaders make the most noise- Nehru, Tito,
B23 1770 Nkrumah, Sukarno, Betancourt, etc&. Our chief aim becomes that
B23 1780 of finding favor in neutralist eyes.   If we grasp this orientation
B23 1790 as a key, our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned
B23 1800 becomes intelligible. And it becomes clear why in general we cannot
B23 1810 take the initiative against the Left.
B24 0010 #BROADWAY# _THE UNORIGINALS_ To write a play, the dramatist once
B24 0020 needed an idea plus the imagination, the knowledge of life and the
B24 0030 craft to develop it. Nowadays, more and more, all he needs is someone
B24 0040 else's book. To get started, he does not scan the world about him;
B24 0050 he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists. So
B24 0060 far this season, Broadway's premieres have included twice as many
B24 0070 adaptations and imports as original American stage plays. _BEST FROM
B24 0080 ABROAD._ Of straight dramas, there are <All the Way Home,>
B24 0090 which owes much of its poetic power to the James Agee novel, <A Death
B24 0100 in the Family; The Wall,> awkwardly based on the John Hersey
B24 0110 novel; <Advise and Consent,> lively but shallow theater drawn
B24 0120 from the mountainously detailed bestseller; <Face of a Hero> (closed),
B24 0130 based on a Pierre Boulle novel. The only original works
B24 0135 attempting
B24 0140 to reach any stature: Tennessee Williams' disappointing domestic
B24 0150 comedy, <Period of Adjustment,> and Arthur Laurents' clever
B24 0160 but empty <Invitation to a March>. Clearly the most provocative
B24 0170 plays are all imported originals- <A Taste of Honey,> by Britain's
B24 0180 young (19 when she wrote it) Shelagh Delaney; <Becket,>
B24 0190 by France's Jean Anouilh; <The Hostage> (closed), by Ireland's
B24 0200 Brendan Behan.   Among the musicals, <Camelot> came
B24 0210 from T& H& White's <The Once and Future King,> and novels
B24 0220 were the sources of the less than momentous <Tenderloin> and <Do
B24 0230 Re Mi. Wildcat> and <The Unsinkable Molly Brown> were originals,
B24 0240 but pretty bad, leaving top honors again to an import- the
B24 0250 jaunty and charmingly French <Irma La Douce>. The only other works
B24 0260 at least technically original were dreary farces- <Send Me No
B24 0270 Flowers> (closed), <Under the Yum-Yum Tree, Critic's Choice>.
B24 0280 In the forthcoming <The Conquering Hero> and <Carnival,>
B24 0290 Broadway is not even adapting books, but reconverting old movies
B24 0300 (<Hail the Conquering Hero> and <Lili>). _DRY OF LIFE._
B24 0305 Originals
B24 0310 are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily
B24 0320 bad. Some memorable plays have been drawn from books, notably <Life
B24 0330 with Father> and <Diary of Anne Frank>. And particularly in the
B24 0340 musical field, adaptations have long been the rule, from <Die Fledermaus>
B24 0350 and <The Merry Widow> to <Oklahoma!> and <My Fair
B24 0360 Lady>. As Critic Walter Kerr points out: "Adaptations,
B24 0370 so long as they are good, still qualify as creative". And other defenders
B24 0380 invariably argue that, after all, Shakespeare and Moliere were
B24 0390 adapters too. The difference is that the masters took the bare frame
B24 0400 of a plot and filled it with their own world; most modern adapters
B24 0410 totally accept the world of a book, squeeze it dry of life, and add only
B24 0420 one contribution of their own: stage technique.   The most
B24 0430 frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports
B24 0440 is increasing production expense- producers cannot afford to take chances.
B24 0450 But that explanation is only partly true. Off-Broadway, where
B24 0460 production is still comparatively cheap, is proving itself only slightly
B24 0470 more original. Laudably enough, it is offering classics and off-beat
B24 0480 imports, but last week only one U&S& original was on the boards,
B24 0490 Robert D& Hock's stunning Civil War work, <Borak>. The
B24 0500 real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of U&S& playwrights.
B24 0510 #NIGHTCLUBS# _THE COOCH TERPERS_ <He: "Come
B24 0520 with me to the casbah". She: "By subway or cab"?>
B24 0530 That exchange was not only possible but commonplace last week in Manhattan,
B24 0540 as more and more New Yorkers were discovering 29th Street and
B24 0550 Eighth Avenue, where half a dozen small nightclubs with names like
B24 0560 Arabian Nights, Grecian Palace and Egyptian Gardens are the American
B24 0570 inpost of belly dancing. Several more will open soon. Their
B24 0580 burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52nd Street
B24 0590 burlesque joints, but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always
B24 0600 familial- neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis.
B24 0610 The belly <boites,> with their papier-mache palm trees or hand-painted
B24 0620 Ionic columns, heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of Greek
B24 0630 and Turkish families. Customers often bring their children; between
B24 0640 performances, enthusiastic young men from the audience will take
B24 0650 the floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces. Except for the odd
B24 0660 uptown sex maniac or an overeager Greek sailor, the people watch in
B24 0665 calm absorption. Small, shirt-sleeved
B24 0670 orchestras play in 2/4 or 4/4 time,
B24 0680 using guitars, violins, and more alien instruments with names that
B24 0690 would open Sesame: the oud, grandfather of the lute; the darbuka,
B24 0700 a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass; the def,
B24 0710 a low-pitched tambourine. The girls sit quietly with the musicians, wearing
B24 0720 prim dresses or plain, secretarial shifts, until it is time to
B24 0730 go off to a back room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem.
B24 0740 _CONTINUUM OF MANKIND._ If a dancer is good, she suggests purely
B24 0745 and
B24 0750 superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny- the continuum
B24 0760 of mankind. But a great many of what <Variety> calls the
B24 0770 "cooch terpers" are considerably less cosmic than that. Each dancer
B24 0780 follows the ancient Oriental pattern- she glides sideways with
B24 0790 shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates, and, through breathing
B24 0800 and muscle control, she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips
B24 0820 and away to the far end of the room. This is done at varying speeds,
B24 0830 ranging from the slow and fast <Shifte Telli> (a musical term
B24 0840 meaning
B24 0850 double strings) to the fastest, ecstatic <Karshilama> (meaning
B24 0860 greetings or welcome). The New York dancers are highly eclectic, varying
B24 0870 the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations, back bends
B24 0880 or floor crawls. But they do not strip. The striptease is crass;
B24 0890 the belly dance leaves more to the imagination.   When a dancer
B24 0900 does well, she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills- although
B24 0910 the Manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping
B24 0920 the tips into the dancers' costumes. With tips, the girls average
B24 0930 between $150 and $200 a week, depending on basic salary. Although
B24 0940 they are forbidden to sit with the customers, the dancers are sometimes
B24 0950 proffered drinks, and most of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy.
B24 0960 _THE MELTING POT._ All over the country, belly clubs have never
B24 0970 been bigger, especially in Detroit, Boston and Chicago, and even
B24 0980 in small towns; one of the best dancers, a Turkish girl named Semra,
B24 0990 works at a roadhouse outside Bristol, Conn&. The girls are kept
B24 1000 booked and moving by several agents, notably voluble, black-bearded
B24 1010 Murat Somay, a Manhattan Turk who is the Sol Hurok of the central
B24 1020 abdomen. He can offer nine Turkish girls, plans to import at least
B24 1030 15 more. But a great many of the dancers are more or less native. Sometimes
B24 1040 they get their initial experience in church <haflis,> conducted
B24 1050 by Lebanese and Syrians in the U&S&, where they dance with
B24 1060 just as
B24 1065 few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs.   As the
B24 1070 girls come to belly dancing from this and other origins, the melting
B24 1080 pot has never bubbled more intriguingly. Some Manhattan examples:
B24 1090    @ Jemela (surname: Gerby), 23, seems Hong Kong Oriental
B24 1100 but has a Spanish father and an Indian mother, was born in America
B24 1110 and educated at
B24 1120 Holy Cross Academy and Textile High School, says
B24 1130 she learned belly dancing at family picnics.   @ Serene (Mrs&
B24 1140 Wilson), 23, was born in Budapest and raised in Manhattan. Daughter
B24 1150 of a gypsy mother who taught her to dance, she is one of the few
B24 1160 really beautiful girls in the New York casbah, with dark eyes and dark,
B24 1170 waist-length hair, the face of an adolescent patrician and a lithe,
B24 1185 glimmering body. Many belly dancers are married, but Serene is one
B24 1190 of the few who will admit it.   @ Marlene (surname: Adamo),
B24 1200 25, a Brazilian divorcee who learned the dance from Arabic friends
B24 1210 in Paris, now lives on Manhattan's West Side, is about the best
B24 1220 belly dancer working the casbah, loves it so much that she dances on
B24 1230 her day off. She has the small, highly developed body of a prime athlete,
B24 1240 and holds in contempt the "girls who just move sex".   @
B24 1250 Leila (Malia Phillips), 25, is a Greenwich Village painter of
B24 1260 Persianesque miniatures
B24 1270 who has red hair that cascades almost to her ankles.
B24 1280 A graduate of Hollywood High School, she likes to imagine herself,
B24 1290 as she takes the floor, "a village girl coming in to a festival".
B24 1300    @ Gloria (surname: Ziraldo), circa 30, who was born
B24 1310 in Italy and once did "chorus work" in Toronto, has been around
B24 1320 longer than most of the others, wistfully remembers the old days
B24 1330 when
B24 1340 "we used to get the seamen from the ships, you know, with big turtleneck
B24 1350 sweaters and handkerchiefs and all. But the ships are very slow
B24 1360 now, and we don't get so many sailors any more". The uptown crowd
B24 1370 has moved in, and what girl worth her seventh veil would trade a turtleneck
B24 1380 sweater for a button-down collar?
B24 1390 #A SHORT, TORMENTED SPAN# Of the handful of painters that Austria
B24 1400 has produced in the 20th century, only one, Oskar Kokoschka, is widely
B24 1410 known in the U&S&. This state of unawareness may not last
B24 1420 much longer. For ten years a small group of European and U&S&
B24 1430 critics has been calling attention to the half-forgotten Austrian
B24 1435 expressionist
B24 1440 Egon Schiele, who died 42 years ago at the age of 28. The
B24 1450 critics' campaign finally inspired the first major U&S& exhibit
B24 1460 of Schiele's works. The show has been to Boston and Manhattan,
B24 1470 will in time reach Pittsburgh and Minneapolis. Last week it opened
B24 1480 at the J& B& Speed Museum in Louisville, at the very moment
B24 1490 that a second Schiele exhibit was being made ready at the Felix Landau
B24 1500 gallery in Los Angeles.   Schiele's paintings are anything
B24 1510 but pleasant. His people (<see color>) are angular and knobby-knuckled,
B24 1520 sometimes painfully stretched, sometimes grotesquely foreshortened.
B24 1530 His colors are dark and murky, and his landscapes and cityscapes
B24 1540 seem swallowed in gloom. But he painted some of the boldest and
B24 1550 most original pictures of his time, and even after nearly half a century,
B24 1560 the tense, tormented world he put on canvas has lost none of its
B24 1570 fascination. _THE DEVIL HIMSELF._ The son of a railway stationmaster,
B24 1580 Schiele lived most of his childhood in the drowsy Danubian town
B24 1590 of Tulln, 14 miles northwest of Vienna. He was an emotional, lonely
B24 1600 boy who spent so much time turning out drawings that he did scarcely
B24 1610 any schoolwork. When he was 15, his parents finally allowed him to attend
B24 1620 classes at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. Even there he
B24 1630 did not last for long. Cried one professor after a few months of Student
B24 1640 Schiele's tantrums and rebellion: "The devil himself must
B24 1650 have defecated you into my classroom"!   For a while his
B24 1660 work was influenced deeply by the French impressionists, and by the patterned,
B24 1670 mosaic-like paintings of Gustav Klimt, then the dean of Austrian
B24 1680 art. Gradually Schiele evolved a somber style of his own-
B24 1690 and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter. His pictures were
B24 1700 roundly denounced as "the most disgusting things one has ever seen
B24 1710 in Vienna". He himself was once convicted of painting erotica and
B24 1720 jailed for 24 days- the first three of which he spent desperately trying
B24 1730 to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle. For years he
B24 1740 wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper collars, was even driven
B24 1750 to scrounging for cigarette butts in Vienna's gutters. Drafted
B24 1760 into
B24 1770 the Austrian army, he rebelliously rejected discipline, wangled a Vienna
B24 1780 billet, went on painting. It was not until the last year of his
B24 1790 life that he had his first moneymaking show. _MELANCHOLY OBSESSION._
B24 1800 The unabashed sexuality of so many of this paintings was not the
B24 1805 only
B24 1810 thing that kept the public at bay: his view of the world was one of
B24 1820 almost unrelieved tragedy, and it was too much even for morbid-minded
B24 1830 Vienna. He was obsessed by disease and poverty, by the melancholy of
B24 1840 old age and the tyranny of lust. The children he painted were almost
B24 1850 always in rags, his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness,
B24 1860 and his nudes- including several self-portraits- were stringy,
B24 1870 contorted and strangely pathetic. The subject he liked most was the
B24 1880 female body, which he painted in every state- naked, half-dressed,
B24 1890 muffled to the ears, sitting primly in a chair, lying tauntingly on a
B24 1900 bed or locked in an embrace.
B25 0010 THE MOST surprising thing about the Twenty-second Congress of
B25 0020 the Soviet Communist Party is that it <was> surprising- perhaps
B25 0030 quite as much, in its own way, as the Twentieth Congress of 1956, which
B25 0040 ended with that famous "secret" report on Stalin. The publication
B25 0050 last July of the party's Draft Program- that blueprint for
B25 0060 the "transition to communism"- had led the uninitiated to suppose
B25 0070 that this Twenty-second Congress would be a sort of apotheosis
B25 0080 of the Khrushchev regime, a solemn consecration of ideas which had, in
B25 0090 fact, been current over the last three or four years (i&e&, since
B25 0100 the defeat of the "anti-party group") in all theoretical party
B25 0110 journals. These never ceased to suggest that if, in the eyes of Marx
B25 0120 and Lenin "full communism" was still a very distant ideal, the establishment
B25 0130 of a Communist society had now, under Khrushchev, become
B25 0140 an "immediate and tangible reality". It seems that Khrushchev
B25 0150 himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution
B25 0160 to Marxist doctrine with his Draft Program (a large part of
B25 0170 his twelve-hour speech at the recent Congress was, in fact, very largely
B25 0180 a rehash of that interminable document). He and other Soviet leaders
B25 0190 responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward
B25 0200 some new formulas, such as the early replacement of the dictatorship
B25 0210 of the proletariat by an "All People's State", and also of having
B25 0220 laid down the lines for a much greater "democratization" of
B25 0230 the whole hierarchy of Soviets, starting with the Supreme Soviet itself.
B25 0240 Their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at
B25 0250 "bureaucracy" and would enable "the people" to take a more direct
B25 0260 and active part in running the country. Also, elections would be
B25 0270 more democratic; there might even be two or more candidates for voters
B25 0280 to choose from.   No doubt, there was still a lot in the Draft
B25 0290 Program- and in Khrushchev's speech- which left many points
B25 0300 obscure. Was it the party's intention, for example, to abolish gradually
B25 0310 the <kolkhoz> system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning
B25 0320 <sovkhozes>, i&e&, state farms (which were, moreover, to be progressively
B25 0330 "urbanized")? As we know, the Soviet peasant today
B25 0340 still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on
B25 0350 his private plot; and it is still very far from certain how valid
B25 0360 the party's claim is that in "a growing number of <kolkhozes>"
B25 0370 the peasants are finding it more profitable, to surrender their private
B25 0380 plots to the
B25 0390 <kolkhoz> and to let the latter be turned into something
B25 0400 increasingly like a state farm. If one follows the reports of the
B25 0410 Congress, one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty
B25 0420 in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this
B25 0430 matter.   The Draft Program was interesting in other respects,
B25 0440 too. It contained, for example, a number of curious admissions about
B25 0450 the peasants, who enjoy no sickness benefits, no old-age pensions,
B25 0460 no paid holidays; they still benefit far less than the "other" 50
B25 0470 per cent of the nation from that "welfare state" which the Soviet
B25 0480 Union so greatly prides itself on being. ## OVER ALL these
B25 0490 fairly awkward problems Khrushchev was to skate rather lightly;
B25 0500 and, though he repeated, over and over again, the spectacular figures
B25 0510 of industrial and agricultural production in 1980, the "ordinary"
B25 0520 people in Russia are still a little uncertain as to how "communism"
B25 0530 is really going to work in practice, especially in respect of food.
B25 0540 Would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry? This was something
B25 0550 on which K& himself seemed to have some doubts; for he kept
B25 0560 on threatening that he would "pull the ears" of those responsible
B25 0570 for agricultural production. And, as we know, the Virgin Lands are
B25 0580 <not> producing as much as Khrushchev had hoped.   One cannot
B25 0590 but wonder whether these doubts about the success of Khrushchev's
B25 0600 agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the
B25 0610 big surprises provided by this Congress- the obsessive harping on the
B25 0620 crimes and misdeeds of the "anti-party group"- Molotov, Malenkov,
B25 0630 Kaganovich and others- including the eighty-year-old Marshal
B25 0640 Voroshilov. Molotov, in particular, is being charged with all kinds
B25 0650 of sins- especially with wanting to cut down free public services,
B25 0660 to increase rents and fares; in fact, with having been against <all>
B25 0670 the more popular features of the Khrushchev "welfare state".
B25 0680 The trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one
B25 0690 side of the story: what, in the secret councils of the Kremlin,
B25 0700 Molotov had <really> proposed, we just don't know, and he has had
B25 0710 no chance to reply. ## BUT ONE cannot escape the suspicion
B25 0720 that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated
B25 0730 "anti-party" group would be totally unnecessary if there were not,
B25 0740 inside the party, some secret but genuine opposition to Khrushchev on
B25 0750 vital doctrinal grounds, on the actual methods to be employed in the
B25 0760 "transition to communism" and, last but not least, on foreign policy.
B25 0770    The whole problem of "peaceful coexistence and peaceful
B25 0780 competition" with the capitalist world is in the very center of this
B25 0790 Congress. Mikoyan declared:   "Molotov altogether rejects
B25 0800 the line of peaceful coexistence, reducing this concept merely to the
B25 0810 state of peace or rather, the absence of war at a given moment, and
B25 0820 to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war. His views, in
B25 0830 fact, coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence,
B25 0840 who look upon it merely as a variant of the "cold war" or of an "armed
B25 0850 peace"".   One cannot help wondering whether Molotov
B25 0860 and the rest of the "anti-party group" are not being used as China's
B25 0870 whipping-boys by Khrushchev and his faithful followers. For
B25 0880 something, clearly, has gone very, very seriously wrong in Soviet-Chinese
B25 0890 relations, which were never easy, and have now deteriorated.
B25 0900    The effect of Chou En-lai's clash with Khrushchev, together
B25 0910 with the everlasting attacks on Molotov + Co&, has shifted the whole
B25 0920 attention of the world, including that of the Soviet people, from
B25 0930 the "epoch-making" twenty-year program to the present Soviet-Chinese
B25 0940 conflict. Not only, as we know, did Chou En-lai publicly treat
B25 0950 Khrushchev's attack on Albania as "something that we cannot consider
B25 0960 as a serious Marxist-Leninist approach" to the problem (i&e&,
B25 0970 as something thoroughly dictatorial and "undemocratic"), but
B25 0980 the Albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to
B25 0990 Khrushchev, calling him a liar, a bully, and so on. It is extremely
B25 1000 doubtful that the handful of Albanians who call themselves Communists
B25 1010 could have done this without the direct approval of their Chinese friends.
B25 1020 The big question is whether, in the name of a restored Chinese-Soviet
B25 1030 solidarity, the Chinese will choose to persuade the Albanians
B25 1040 to present their humble apologies to Khrushchev- or get rid of
B25 1050 Enver Hoxa. These seem about the only two ways in which the "unhappy
B25 1060 incident" can now be closed.   But Albania is merely a symptom
B25 1070 of a real malaise between China and Russia. There are other
B25 1080 symptoms. Khrushchev, for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable
B25 1090 decay of capitalism, is genuinely favorable to "peaceful coexistence"
B25 1100 and would like, above all, the Berlin and German problems
B25 1110 to be settled peacefully; he knows that he was never more popular than
B25 1120 at the time of the Russo-American "honeymoon" of 1959. But
B25 1130 it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere- in the
B25 1140 first place from China, but perhaps also from that "China Lobby"
B25 1150 which, I was assured in Moscow nearly two years ago, exists on
B25 1160 the quiet inside the party. To these people, solidarity and unity with
B25 1170 China should be the real basis of Russia's future policy. And the
B25 1180 Chinese, as the Albanian incident shows, have strong suspicions that
B25 1190 Khrushchev is anxious to secure a "shameful" peace with the West.
B25 1200 The fact that China (which is obsessed by Formosa- to Khrushchev
B25 1210 a very small matter) should be supported by North Korea and North
B25 1220 Vietnam is highly indicative. And one cannot but wonder whether
B25 1225 Marshal Malinovsky,
B25 1230 who was blowing hot and cold, exalting peace but
B25 1240 also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against
B25 1250 the West, wasn't trying to keep the Chinese quiet. And this
B25 1255 brings us inevitably to the 30-
B25 1260 or 50-megaton bomb. Was not this dropped
B25 1270 primarily in order to "appease" the Chinese- especially after
B25 1280 "Khrushchev's "humiliating" surrender to the West in canceling
B25 1290 the German peace-treaty deadline of December 31?   What
B25 1300 does it all add up to? Indications are that Khrushchev (and, with
B25 1310 him, the bulk of the Soviet people) favor peaceful coexistence and (with
B25 1320 the exception of Berlin) the maintenance of the <status quo> in
B25 1330 the world. The Chinese, North Vietnamese and North Koreans, on
B25 1340 the other hand, feel that, militarily, Russia is strong enough to support
B25 1350 them in the "just wars of liberation" they would like to embark
B25 1360 on before long: with China attacking Formosa and the North Koreans
B25 1370 and North Vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective
B25 1380 countries.   Perhaps Khrushchev is in a more difficult
B25 1390 position than any since 1957, when the "anti-party group" nearly
B25 1400 liquidated him. He seems strong enough inside the party to cope with
B25 1410 any internal opposition; but if he is up against China's crusading
B25 1420 spirit in world affairs, he is going to be faced with the most agonizing
B25 1430 choice in his life. He may support China (but he won't); he
B25 1440 may break with China (which would be infernally difficult and perhaps
B25 1450 disastrous), or he may succeed, by all kinds of dangerous concessions,
B25 1460 in persuading China to be patient. The next days may show where things
B25 1470 stand.
B25 1480 ON a misty Sunday morning last month, a small band of militant
B25 1490 anti-Communists called the Minutemen held maneuvers in a foggy field
B25 1500 about fifteen miles east of here. Eleven men, a woman and a teen-age
B25 1510 boy tramped over cold, damp, fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour
B25 1520 field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare.   To the average
B25 1530 American, this must sound like an incredible tale from a Saturday
B25 1540 night ~TV movie. But to the Minutemen, this is a serious business.
B25 1550 They feel that the United States is engaged in a life-and-death
B25 1560 struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy. They feel
B25 1570 that World War /3, has already begun, and they are setting themselves
B25 1580 up as a "last line of defense" against the Communist advance.
B25 1590    Their national leader, Robert Bolivar DePugh of Norborne,
B25 1600 Mo&, says the Minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best
B25 1610 suited to defeat the Red onslaught. In their maneuvers last month,
B25 1620 they wore World War /2, camouflage garb and helmets, and carried unloaded
B25 1630 ~M-1 rifles.   The maneuvers were held "in secret"
B25 1640 after a regional seminar for the Minutemen, held in nearby Shiloh,
B25 1650 Ill&, had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs, who had
B25 1660 arrested regional leader Richard Lauchli of Collinsville, Ill&,
B25 1670 and seized four operative weapons, including a Browning machine gun,
B25 1680 two Browning automatic rifles and an ~M-4 rifle.   Undismayed
B25 1690 by this contretemps, a small band of the faithful gathered at Lauchli's
B25 1700 home at 6:30 A&M& the next day, put on their uniforms,
B25 1710 and headed for a farm several miles away. A 60 mm& mortar and a
B25 1715 57 mm&
B25 1720 recoilless rifle owned by Lauchli were brought along. The mortar
B25 1730 was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated.
B25 1740    After a tortuous drive in an open truck and a World War
B25 1750 /2, army jeep down soggy trails, the band arrived at a small clearing
B25 1760 squeezed between a long, low ridge and a creek-filled gully. Here
B25 1770 the two leaders, DePugh and Lauchli, hastened to put the group
B25 1780 through its paces.   The Minutemen were instructed in the use
B25 1790 of terrain for concealment. They were shown how to advance against an
B25 1800 enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge. They practiced movement behind a
B25 1810 smoke screen laid by smoke grenades; and they attempted a skirmish
B25 1820 line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment. Eleven dummy
B25 1830 rounds were fired by Lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire mortar
B25 1840 shooting.   Mrs& DePugh, the mother of five children and an
B25 1850 active member of her husband's organization, participated in all the
B25 1860 exercises.   There were no "casualties", but the "guerrillas"
B25 1870 admitted to being "a little tired" when the leaders called
B25 1880 a halt at 9 A&M& to enable out-of-town members to catch a plane.
B26 0010 #TENURE AS CRITERION# I would like to add one more practical reform
B26 0020 to those mentioned by Russell Kirk [Dec& 16]. It has to do
B26 0030 with teachers' salaries and tenure.   Next September, after receiving
B26 0040 a degree from Yale's Master of Arts in Teaching Program,
B26 0050 I will be teaching somewhere- that much is guaranteed by the present
B26 0060 shortage of mathematics teachers. I will also be underpaid. The
B26 0070 amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers. Teaching
B26 0080 is at present a sellers' market; as a result buyers, the
B26 0090 public, must be satisfied with second-rate teachers. But this is not
B26 0100 the real problem; the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually
B26 0110 paid on the basis of time served rather than quality. Hence all
B26 0120 teachers, good and bad, who have been teaching for a given number of
B26 0130 years are paid the same salary. I am firmly convinced that considering
B26 0140 the average quality of teachers in this country, the profession is grossly
B26 0150 overpaid.   It follows that teachers as a group cannot expect
B26 0160 any marked salary increases; there is a limit to how much the public
B26 0170 will pay for shoddy performance. The only hope which good teachers
B26 0180 have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight
B26 0190 of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them. The only hope which
B26 0200 the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis
B26 0210 of merit rather than tenure. Here, as in all sectors of the economy,
B26 0220 quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual
B26 0230 to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses. @ #LOSS
B26 0240 OF INITIATIVE# On the eve of the "great debate" on the proposal
B26 0250 to give the President broad powers to make across-the-board tariff concessions
B26 0260 which could practically bring us into the Atlantic Community,
B26 0270 we should face the alternatives on this proposition. What we will
B26 0280 be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be <selective>
B26 0290 which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which
B26 0300 we now operate. Without this power we lay open any American industry
B26 0310 which the Europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy
B26 0320 to the will of others. It is this loss of initiative in how we conduct
B26 0330 our <economy> which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we
B26 0340 conduct our <political> affairs. @ #A BRIEF FOR THE NEGATIVE#
B26 0350 I disagree with Mr& Burnham's position on the Common Market
B26 0360 [Nov& 18] as a desirable organization for us to join. For him to
B26 0370 ignore the political consequences involved in an Atlantic Union of
B26 0380 this kind is difficult to understand. The pressure for our entry to
B26 0390 the Common Market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated
B26 0400 trade union by way of a purely "economic thoroughfare", or
B26 0410 garden path, with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background.
B26 0420 The appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing
B26 0430 to those who do not see its relation to political and legal,
B26 0440 as well as economic, self-rule. In entering this union we will be surrendering
B26 0450 most, if not all, of our economic autonomy to international
B26 0460 bodies such as the Atlantic Institute (recently set up) or the O&E&C&D&,
B26 0470 I&M&F& and others. To think that we can merely
B26 0480 relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political
B26 0490 or legal autonomy is wishful thinking.   If it is not enough that
B26 0500 all of our internationalist One Worlders are advocating that we join
B26 0510 this market, I refer you to an article in the <New York Times>'
B26 0520 magazine section [Nov& 12, 1961], by Mr& Eric Johnston,
B26 0530 entitled "We Must Join the Common Market". He says: "It
B26 0540 has swept aside petty nationalisms, age-old rivalries, and worn-out
B26 0550 customs". Referring to Britain, he says, "We see a nation that
B26 0560 traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its
B26 0570 economy, placing this authority in Continental hands". **h Since
B26 0580 the goal of our international planners is a World Government, this Atlantic
B26 0590 Community would mark a giant step in that direction for, once
B26 0600 American economic autonomy is absorbed, a larger grouping is a question
B26 0610 of time. Frankly, it is being very cleverly done for, in a sense,
B26 0620 they have us over a barrel. Listen to what Mr& Johnston has to
B26 0630 say: "Consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict.
B26 0640 **h We would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports
B26 0650 we need. We would be crippled by reduced output, industrial decline,
B26 0660 widespread unemployment".   But the solution to this dilemma
B26 0670 is not the incorporation of the United States into an Atlantic Community
B26 0680 or "economic empire", but merely what libertarians like Henry
B26 0690 Hazlitt and Ludwig von Mises have been arguing for years: an
B26 0700 end to government regulations, an end to government competition in industry,
B26 0710 and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry. Create a
B26 0720 free market here, give us a sound, debt-free money system, and we'll
B26 0730 compete with anyone, Europe and Asia combined. In short, get this
B26 0740 governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won't have to worry about
B26 0750 European competition or Communism either. If we want to preserve
B26 0760 our sovereignty, this is the way to do it; not acquiesce to an international
B26 0770 planning board. If we go into this Common Market, we might
B26 0780 just as well stop talking about Constitutional guarantees, Connally
B26 0790 Amendments or, for that matter, conservatism in general. @

B26 0870 AND THE ARMY# In 1954 I was drafted and after serving two
B26 0880 years honorably on Active Duty I was not required to participate in
B26 0890 any further Army Reserve activities. Now, more than five years later,
B26 0900 I cannot in any realistic sense be called a trained soldier. But,
B26 0910 in spite of this, I, at present a man 31 years of age and a College
B26 0920 Professor, have been recalled "by direction of the President"
B26 0930 to report on November 25th to Fort Devens, Massachusetts, for another
B26 0940 twelve months of Active Duty as an ~Sp 4 (the equivalent of a
B26 0950 ~PFC). Today, seven years after the date of my initial induction
B26 0960 as a draftee, I am Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Science
B26 0970 at St& Michael's College. For, after leaving the Army in 1956,
B26 0980 I spent five years in Graduate School first at Boston College
B26 0990 and then at the University of Toronto. This time, added to that which
B26 1000 I had already spent in school prior to my induction in 1954, makes
B26 1010 a total of twenty-two (22) years of education.   The possibility
B26 1020 of recall into the Army is part of the price that a modern American
B26 1030 has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys. With
B26 1040 this no loyal citizen can quarrel. However, it seems axiomatic that
B26 1050 the government has an obligation "to exercise its mandate reasonably,
B26 1060 equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably
B26 1070 causes". In my own case, I submit that such reasonable and fair
B26 1080 exercise is woefully lacking. Taken back into the Army now as an
B26 1090 ~Sp 4, I am leaving 110 college students whose teacher I am. (A
B26 1100 wry sidelight on this is that most of my students have deferments from
B26 1110 the draft in order to attend my classes.) At this late date, it is
B26 1120 impossible for St& Michael's College to find a suitable replacement
B26 1130 for me. Even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal
B26 1140 life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very
B26 1150 compelling reason- I cannot help looking around at the black leather
B26 1160 jacket brigades standing idly on the street corners and in the taverns
B26 1170 of every American city and asking myself if our society has gone
B26 1180 mad. @ #MERCENARY: TERM OF HONOR?# In news broadcasts I consistently
B26 1190 hear the foreign volunteers fighting in the Katanga Army
B26 1200 referred to as mercenaries. This confuses me no end. If the Hessian
B26 1210 troops sent here willy-nilly by the Hessian Government to fight for
B26 1220 England in the 1770's were mercenaries, what shall we call the ~UN
B26 1230 troops sent to the Congo willy-nilly by <their> governments to
B26 1240 fight for the United Nations? If the ~UN troops are not mercenaries
B26 1250 then the Hessians were not mercenaries either. And if the foreigners
B26 1260 fighting in the Katanga Army are mercenaries then Lafayette
B26 1270 and von Steuben were mercenaries too, as were also the members of the
B26 1280 Lafayette Escadrille in the early part of World War /1, and of
B26 1290 Chennault's Flying Tigers in the early days of World War /2,.

B26 1320 what's wrong with Cherokee Textile's slogan ["Pitney-Bowes
B26 1330 Objects", July 1]. It's an eighteenth-century negative, man!
B26 1340 Suggest the following twenty-first-century amendment: @ By moving
B26 1350 the term "Republic" to lower case, substituting the modern
B26 1360 phrase "move ahead" for the stodgy "keep", and by using the Postmaster's

B26 1390 IMPENDING DEATH OF POPE# In the issue of March 5, 1960 you had an
B26 1400 excellent editorial which said:   "On trial in Jakarta for
B26 1410 having flown for the Indonesian anti-Communist insurgents,
B26 1415 U&S&
B26 1420 pilot Alan Lawrence Pope boldly told the court that in supporting
B26 1430 the freedom fighters, he was actually defending the sovereignty and independence
B26 1440 of Indonesia. Facing a prosecution which has demanded the
B26 1450 death penalty, he said: 'I have participated in the war against
B26 1460 Communism in Korea and at Dienbienphu, and I have helped in the evacuation
B26 1470 of North Vietnamese to the free world. I have done all this
B26 1480 for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states
B26 1490 which have been threatened by Communist domination'. At least in
B26 1500 Indonesia, Khrushchev found an American proud to be at total war with
B26 1510 Communism"!   Since then nothing has happened to save the
B26 1520 life of Pope. I found recently a very small article in the <New
B26 1525 York Times:>   "U&S&
B26 1530 Flier loses Plea. Indonesia Court
B26 1540 Upholds Pope's Death Sentence.- Indonesia Military Supreme
B26 1550 Court has confirmed the death sentence passed on Alan Lawrence
B26 1560 Pope, an American pilot. Pope was convicted last year of having aided
B26 1570 North Celebes rebels by flying bombing missions. He has been in
B26 1580 prison since May, 1958, when his aircraft was shot down over Moluccas.
B26 1590 He may appeal to President Sukarno for clemency".   As
B26 1600 we see, Pope may appeal to President Sukarno, Khrushchev's friend,
B26 1610 for clemency. This possibility is anything but reassuring.
B26 1620 The Eleanor Roosevelt Tractor Committee acts on behalf of the Cuban
B26 1630 freedom fighters. But who will act now and immediately to save the
B26 1640 life of Alan Pope? Are tractors available for him? Does anybody
B26 1650 think of saving the life of an anti-Communist American pilot?
B26 1660 @ #AN ANALOGY# A few days before I saw your mention of what Texas
B26 1670 Liberals were doing to promote "Louis Capet" ["The Week",
B26 1680 June 3], another analogy had occurred to me.   Consider
B26 1690 this table: _1._ Louis /14,- ~FDR. "**h With no strong
B26 1700 men and no parliament to dispute his will, he <was> the government".
B26 1710 _2._ Regency- Truman. "A 'dust-settling' period
B26 1720 of decadence and decline". _3._ Louis /15,- Eisenhower.
B26 1730 "**h he opened his mouth, said little, and thought not at all". _4._
B26 1740 Louis /16,- Kennedy. "**h not <completely> virtuous,
B26 1750 but <completely> incompetent".   And Marie Antoinette- Jacqueline
B26 1760 Bouvier. "**h the beautiful and light-hearted". _5._
B26 1770 French Revolution- Conservative Revolution?   Truly,
B26 1780 that Liberals should choose Louis /14, as a bogey-symbol of conservatism
B26 1790 is grotesquely ironic, considering the Louis /14, character
B26 1800 of their Grand Monarque, ~FDR: not only in his accretion of absolute
B26 1810 power and personal deification, (<le roi gouverne par lui meme>),
B26 1820 but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies.
B26 1830    In defeating "Louis Capet", John Tower's victory in
B26 1840 Texas signals, once again, the end of the divine right of Liberalism.
B27 0010 #CONFRONTATION# IT SEEMS TO ME that N&C&, in his editorial
B27 0020 "Confrontation" [~SR, Mar& 25], has hit upon the real
B27 0030 problem that bothers all of us in a complex world: how do we retain
B27 0040 our personal relationship with those who suffer? This affects us
B27 0050 all intimately, and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress.
B27 0060 I know of no other solution than the one N&C& proposes-
B27 0070 to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us, hoping that
B27 0080 this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place. Never
B27 0090 have I seen this expressed so clearly and so sympathetically. @
B27 0100    THANK YOU for the illustrated editorial "Confrontation".
B27 0110 It is both great writing and profound religion. @   N&C&
B27 0120 HAS SAID something important so well that this preacher
B27 0130 will many times be tempted to quote the whole piece. @   I
B27 0140 FEEL THAT N&C& hit the very core of our existence in the editorial
B27 0150 "Confrontation". Personally, it meant a great deal; my
B27 0160 only hope is that it will be shared by many, many others. @   "CONFRONTATION"
B27 0170 should fortify us all, whether in Southeast
B27 0180 Asia or the U&S&. @   CONGRATULATIONS TO N&C&
B27 0190 for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the
B27 0200 Peace Corps. I concur that it is necessary for Americans to have
B27 0210 a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands. It would
B27 0220 be heartbreaking to see idealism, and hence effective leadership, thwarted
B27 0230 by the poverty and hardship which young Americans will run into.
B27 0240 @   THE EDITORIAL "Confrontation" was certainly direct
B27 0250 in its appear to those of us living here in America. I personally
B27 0260 gained strength from it. Thanks for continuing to capture the attention
B27 0270 and uncover so many areas of need in this amazing world. @
B27 0280    N&C&'s EDITORIAL "Confrontation" is a stunning piece
B27 0290 of writing. I would hope that Sargent Shriver will encourage everyone
B27 0300 entering the Peace Corps to read it. The important people to
B27 0310 humanity are not the Khrushchevs and the Castros **h but the Schweitzers
B27 0320 and the Dooleys, and the others like them whose names we will
B27 0330 never know. @   EDITOR'S NOTE: <Reprints of "Confrontation"
B27 0340 will be included among the material to be distributed to
B27 0350 members of the Peace Corps. A Peace Corps official described the
B27 0360 editorial as "precisely the message we need to communicate to the
B27 0370 men and women who will soon be Peace Corps volunteers>". #IMPROPER
B27 0380 BOSTONIAN?# F& L& LUCAS'S article in ~SR's
B27 0390 April 1 issue seemed to be a very fair and objective analysis of the
B27 0400 New English Bible. I certainly hope this will be the impression left
B27 0410 in the minds of readers, rather than the comment by Cleveland Amory
B27 0420 in his FIRST OF THE MONTH column. It is blind, fundamentalist
B27 0430 dogmatism to say, "Messing around with the King James version
B27 0440 **h seems to us a perilous sport at best". @ #FACTS IN FOCUS#
B27 0450 LESTER MARKEL is on the right track in his article "Interpretation
B27 0455 of Interpretation"
B27 0460 [~SR, Mar& 11]. The current stereotype
B27 0470 of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting
B27 0480 the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored
B27 0490 fact, fancy, and personal opinion called yellow journalism which flourished
B27 0500 in this country more than a generation ago.   We don't
B27 0510 need this type of protection any more. The public is now armed with
B27 0520 sophistication and numerous competing media. Besides, there are no
B27 0530 longer enough corruptible journalists about.   The accepted method
B27 0540 of writing news has two major liabilities. First, it does not communicate.
B27 0550 A reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements
B27 0560 of both sides in a major labor dispute, for instance, is unable to tell
B27 0570 his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute.
B27 0580 Second, it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous. The
B27 0590 charges by the late junior Senator from Wisconsin not only destroyed
B27 0600 innocent people but misled the nation. Yet the press was powerless
B27 0610 to put these charges in perspective in its news columns. despite several
B27 0620 years of front-page stories, the average citizen was unable to get
B27 0630 a complete picture of McCarthy until he saw on the television screen
B27 0640 what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way
B27 0650 of communicating. The Senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions.
B27 0660    It seems to me the time has come for the American
B27 0670 press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will
B27 0680 do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by
B27 0690 those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve
B27 0700 their own ends. The objective should be to provide a method of getting
B27 0710 into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant
B27 0720 information in the possession of reporters and editors. @
B27 0730 #SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BLACKOUT# I WOULD LIKE to see you devote
B27 0740 some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning President
B27 0750 Kennedy's activities, so far as Southern California is concerned.
B27 0760 You have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised
B27 0770 press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent
B27 0780 opinions.   To begin with, the all-powerful Los Angeles <Times>
B27 0790 does not publish a transcript of these press conferences. I
B27 0800 am sure that they did when Eisenhower was President.   Next,
B27 0810 because of the time differential, the conferences come on the networks
B27 0820 during the middle of the day. Up until now, the networks have grudgingly
B27 0830 run half-hour tapes at 5 P&M& or sometimes 7 or 10:30 P&M&.
B27 0840 Even then, a few of the "less interesting" questions are
B27 0850 edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator. However, last night
B27 0860 the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got
B27 0870 on ~TV were a few snatches which Douglas Edwards and Huntley
B27 0880 and Brinkley could squeeze into their programs. This is no criticism
B27 0890 of them, as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute
B27 0900 news summary.   The radio stations did run "transcripts"
B27 0910 (I thought) during the evening hours. However, by comparing
B27 0920 the ~TV snatches, two different radio station re-runs, and the censored
B27 0930 Los Angeles <Times> version, I found that the radio stations
B27 0940 had edited out questions (~ABC removed the one regarding Laos)
B27 0950 or even a paragraph out of the middle of the President's answer.
B27 0960 I am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country
B27 0970 about the "abuse" he is being subjected to. We out here don't
B27 0980 see enough of the conference to know he is being abused.   I don't
B27 0990 know if this is the situation in other parts of the country; apparently
B27 1000 it is not. It also happened with the Inauguration, which was
B27 1010 not re-run at all during the evening hours, and I wrote to the ~TV
B27 1020 editor of the <Times>. He did mention in his column the fact that
B27 1030 he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand
B27 1040 the networks and the independent local stations' not doing this-
B27 1050 but nothing happened.   Can you bring the networks' attention
B27 1060 to this? @ #FOR A COLLEGE OF PROPAGANDA# I WAS INTERESTED
B27 1070 in James Webb Young's MADISON AVENUE column in which
B27 1080 he raised the question "Do We Need a College of Propaganda"?
B27 1090 [~SR, Feb& 11].   In my estimation, we definitely
B27 1100 do; and the sad part of it is that we had one, which was rounding into
B27 1110 excellent shape, and we let it disintegrate and die.   During
B27 1120 the war, we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare,
B27 1130 which included the teaching of propaganda, both black and white and the
B27 1140 various shades of grey in between. We had a couple of schools in this
B27 1150 country, the principal one being on the Marshall Field estate out
B27 1160 in Lloyd's Neck. There were also a couple in Canada, and several
B27 1170 in England. The English schools preceded ours, and by the time we
B27 1180 got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda
B27 1190 and its teaching.   Four of us here in the United States attended,
B27 1200 first as students, then as instructors, almost every one of these
B27 1210 schools, in England, Canada, and the United States. We set up
B27 1220 the Lloyd's Neck school, worked out its curriculum, and taught there.
B27 1230 Toward the end of the war, we really felt that we had learned something
B27 1240 about propaganda and how to teach it.   When the end did
B27 1250 come, and the schools were disbanded and abandoned, we felt and hoped
B27 1260 that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust.
B27 1270 We hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some
B27 1280 sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year
B27 1290 or so. Alas, no such thing happened. There apparently is no school of
B27 1300 propaganda or psychological warfare. A study at the Pentagon and at
B27 1310 the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there. And
B27 1320 not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been
B27 1330 called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way. @   CONGRATULATIONS
B27 1340 on the article "Do We Need a College of Propaganda"?
B27 1350 This is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this
B27 1360 critical field in years, and I certainly hope it sparks some action.
B27 1370 @ #LET THE MEDIA CLEAN HOUSE, TOO# MANY OF US in public
B27 1380 relations were flattered that Richard L& Tobin chose to devote his
B27 1390 editorial in the March 11 Communications Supplement to the merger
B27 1400 of the Public Relations Society of America and the American Public
B27 1410 Relations Association.
B27 1420 #SNOW STORM# I WAS SURPRISED and sorry to find in your issue
B27 1430 of March 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not yet
B27 1440 been published.   Whether in his forthcoming book C& P& Snow
B27 1450 commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily
B27 1460 autobiographical critic charged him is important. One should be able
B27 1470 to get hold of the book at once. But the attack was made from an advance
B27 1480 copy. If this practice should take root and spread, the man who
B27 1490 submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before
B27 1500 he is accepted and publication will become a sort of post-mortem formality.
B27 1510 @   EDITOR'S NOTE: <Sir Robert Watson-Watt

B27 1560 its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of Godkin

B27 1640 an excerpt from the book in advance of the book's publication date.
B27 1650 The text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the
B27 1660 prepublication excerpt>. ## SIR ROBERT WATSON-WATT'S "rebuttal"
B27 1670 of Sir Charles Snow's Godkin Lectures is marred throughout
B27 1680 by too forceful a desire to defend Lindemann and apparently himself
B27 1690 from Sir Charles' supposed falsehoods while stating those "falsehoods"
B27 1700 in an unclear incoherent argument.   The article
B27 1710 presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning. It calls the
B27 1720 conclusion admitted valid by "historians and military strategists alike"
B27 1730 a "perverted conclusion. **h nonsense".   It submits
B27 1740 an enthusiastic, impressionistic conception of Lindemann contributing
B27 1750 another aspect of the man, but on no more authoritative basis than Sir
B27 1760 Charles' account. We are left to choose between the two Lindemanns.
B27 1770    The only fact that holds any weight in the article is the
B27 1780 result of the tea party. But we are to believe that Lindemann actively
B27 1790 supported radar outside the Tizard Committee, and dissembling,
B27 1800 discounted it inside? If so, I would lean to Sir Charles' conception
B27 1810 of the man.   I think it was a grave error to print the
B27 1820 article at this time. To the unfortunate people unable to attend the
B27 1830 Godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the
B27 1840 book which may dissuade some people from reading it. @
