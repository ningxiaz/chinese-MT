E01 0010 @   Too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly
E01 0020 either because his parents don't want sonny-boy to "lift all
E01 0030 those old barbell things" because "you'll stunt your growth"
E01 0040 **h or because childish taunts from his schoolmates, like "Hey **h
E01 0050 lookit Mr& America **h whaddya gonna do with all those muscles (of
E01 0060 which he has none at the time)"?   After all, a guy's gotta
E01 0070 have a little ego!   Therefore it's a genuine pleasure
E01 0080 to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has <never> had
E01 0090 to train in secret **h has <never> heard one unkind word from his parents
E01 0100 **h and <never> has been taunted by his schoolmates!
E01 0110 This happy, always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new
E01 0120 <Junior Mr& Canada>- Henri de Courcy.   Far from discouraging
E01 0130 Henri, his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments.
E01 0140 Instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they
E01 0150 personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority,
E01 0160 Professor Roland Claude.   And they couldn't have entrusted
E01 0170 Henri to better hands because "le professeur" knows his muscles
E01 0180 from the <sterno-cleido mastoideus> of the neck right down to the <tibialis
E01 0190 anticus> of the leg **h and better still, he knows just what
E01 0200 exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine
E01 0210 them with for fast, <fast> muscle growth.   That's because the
E01 0220 good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal
E01 0230 Health Studio which is located at 1821 Mt& Royal East in Montreal.
E01 0240 Undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning
E01 0250 pupils (every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other).
E01 0260 There's Gaetan d'Amours who is our newest <Mr& Canada>
E01 0270 **h Jean-Paul Senesac, whose story appeared here two issues ago
E01 0280 **h Jack Boissoneault, who was with us last month **h Charles Harve,
E01 0290 who recently won the "Most Muscular Man" subdivision award
E01 0300 in the {Mr& Canada} event **h and a host of others. Yesiree **h
E01 0310 the professor knows his muscles!   Now when Henri was just
E01 0320 12 he was only 4' 10'' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds,
E01 0330 and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight. About that time
E01 0340 he began reading {Mr& America} and {Muscle Builder}
E01 0350 and he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight gaining. Seeing
E01 0360 so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value
E01 0370 of {Quick-Wate} and {Super-Protein}, those two wonder-working
E01 0380 Weider food supplements, he decided to try them and see what they
E01 0390 could do for him.   Well, sir **h they did real great! For
E01 0400 in almost less time than it takes to tell it, Henri's bodyweight was
E01 0410 increasing rapidly. Of course he did some exercising **h he's crazy
E01 0420 about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction
E01 0430 with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle
E01 0440 on his skinny frame.   Henri has always had shapely legs from swimming
E01 0450 and water skiing and really doesn't have to work them very much.
E01 0460 But he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body. It was muscular
E01 0470 but it wasn't symmetrical. "A real 'nothing' torso", says
E01 0480 Henri. "It never seemed to widen **h it just got longer and longer".
E01 0490    That's when he went to Professor Claude. And at
E01 0500 once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct
E01 0510 it. In his gym the professor has some of the most "knocked out" equipment
E01 0520 since Vic Tanny. Mr& Claude is a specialist in torso development
E01 0530 and he has long favored the now-famous Weider {Push-Pull
E01 0540 Super-Set} technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is
E01 0550 a {pressing} or "pushing" movement which accents one sector of
E01 0560 a muscle group in a specific way, followed by a "pulling" exercise
E01 0570 which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group.   So
E01 0580 right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous "moon" bench
E01 0590 and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull Super-Set consisting
E01 0600 of the wide-grip Straight-Arm Pullover (the "pull" part of the
E01 0610 Push-Pull Super-Set) which dramatically widens the ribcage and
E01 0620 strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest **h and the
E01 0630 collar-to-collar Bench Press which specifically works on the chest to
E01 0640 build those wide, Reeves-type "gladiator" ~pecs, while stimulating
E01 0650 the upper ~lats and frontal deltoids.   As you can see,
E01 0660 in this Push-Pull Super Set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is
E01 0670 vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises **h so
E01 0680 the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time!   Now when
E01 0690 Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No& 1,
E01 0700 the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting
E01 0710 him on four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No& 2.   Super-Set
E01 0720 No& 2 is made up of similar exercises, but this time done
E01 0730 with dumbbells, and using both "moon" and flat benches. The "push"
E01 0740 exercise of this Push-Pull Super-Set is the Bench Press done
E01 0750 with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of
E01 0760 the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation. You need the
E01 0770 barbell variation to build width and mass in the ~pecs **h the dumbbell
E01 0780 variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the ~pecs.
E01 0790    The "pull" exercise in this Super-Set is the one-dumbbell
E01 0800 Bent-Arm Pullover.
E01 0810 (Note how strongly
E01 0820 the upper ~lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise
E01 0830 because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation
E01 0840 affords).   In the third Push-Pull Super-Set the "push"
E01 0850 exercise is the widegrip Pushup Between Bars, while the "pull"
E01 0860 exercise is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent arms.
E01 0870    The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage
E01 0880 stretcher ever invented! This is true {only} if a very wide grip
E01 0890 is used and {only} when the {greatest possible stretch} is
E01 0900 achieved. You'll know when you've made the greatest stretch because
E01 0910 your shoulder blades will touch! As you see, the professor has designed
E01 0920 a piece of apparatus that {forces} the bodybuilder to use
E01 0930 a w-i-d-e grip **h he has to; he just can't do anything about it at
E01 0940 all!   But as you can also see, it's not a painful exercise
E01 0950 at all, because Henri de Courcy- the "happy" bodybuilder-
E01 0960 looks as though he were having the time of his life!   The last
E01 0970 exercise of Roland Claude's prescribed program for Henri is a single
E01 0980 exercise, done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between
E01 0990 sets. By this time Henri's entire chest-back-~lat-shoulder area
E01 1000 is pumped-up to almost bursting point, and Claude takes time to
E01 1010 do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work. He has Henri do
E01 1020 from four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press (note the high incline).
E01 1030 This gives a wide flare to the ~pecs, causing them to flow
E01 1040 dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the
E01 1050 serratus and ~lats.   This is the kind of chest that invariably
E01 1060 wins contests **h that steel-edged "carved-out-of-solid rock" looks
E01 1070 of the great champions.   So with four complete Push-Pull
E01 1080 Super-Sets No& 1, four of No& 2, four of No& 3 and four to
E01 1090 six sets of the Incline Bench Press, you can see that Henri de Courcy
E01 1100 has had a terrific mass-building, muscle-shaping, torso-defining
E01 1110 workout that cannot be improved upon.
E01 1120 @   Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone **h
E01 1130 rarer still is a <Mr& America> or <Mr& Universe> of true Herculean
E01 1140 build. The aspects of physical development that catch the judges'
E01 1150 eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry
E01 1160 and that hallmark of the true champion- <superior definition>
E01 1161 of the muscles.
E01 1170    Now <good> definition is one thing that all of us can
E01 1180 acquire with occasional high-set, high-rep, light-weight workouts.
E01 1190 But <contest> definition- that dramatic muscular separation of every
E01 1200 muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor's
E01 1210 chisel- is something quite different. This comes not alone
E01 1220 from high-set, high-rep training, but from certain definition-specialization
E01 1230 exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge
E01 1240 of exactly what works best for <him>.   Often these exercises
E01 1250 work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others.
E01 1260 Because they are "minority" exercises and have but a limited
E01 1270 appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten. Only
E01 1280 when the newest <Mr& America> or <Mr& Universe> rediscovers
E01 1290 them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and
E01 1300 once again see how effective they really are.   The exercise I
E01 1310 shall discuss in this- the first of a new series of articles on muscle
E01 1320 definition-specialization of a particular body part- is the One
E01 1330 Leg Lunge. Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say
E01 1340 because it works perfectly for <everyone>, no matter whether he has
E01 1350 short or long thigh-bone lengths!   It is the one exercise
E01 1360 that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the {hipline}-
E01 1370 that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other
E01 1380 bodybuilders **h a criterion of muscle "drama" that is unforgettable
E01 1390 to judges and audiences alike **h the facet of muscular development
E01 1400 that wins prizes.   Definition of the thighs at the uppermost
E01 1410 part is quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters which
E01 1420 is easily understandable. The One Leg Lunge is a {split} and
E01 1430 all lifters practice this in their regular workouts.   But for
E01 1440 purely definition purposes- used in conjunction with your regular
E01 1450 Squatting, Leg Curling, Leg Extensor programs- a heavy weight is
E01 1460 not needed. Indeed, a lighter weight works much better because a greater,
E01 1470 more extensive split can be performed. Used in several sets of
E01 1480 high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire
E01 1490 upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look
E01 1500 like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin!   Really
E01 1510 there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way
E01 1520 into your leg program at all times, for the following suggestions show
E01 1530 why it is so effective: _1._ It's a {complete} thigh contraction-extension
E01 1550 exercise. _2._ It places terrific tension on
E01 1560 the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition. _3._ It
E01 1570 improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder, and helps
E01 1580 to make Squats more easily and more correctly performed. _4._ It
E01 1590 increases flexibility of the legs. _5._ It speeds muscle growth
E01 1600 and power development even for the {advanced} bodybuilder because
E01 1610 each hip and leg is exercised separately, thus enabling a massive, concentrated
E01 1620 effort to be focused on each.   You'll need your Weider
E01 1630 Power Stands for this fine exercise and here's the way it's
E01 1640 done: _1._ Place your Power Stands in position and adjust their
E01 1650 height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders
E01 1660 when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy Clean. _2._ Place
E01 1670 a suitably-loaded barbell across them; grasp the bar (which will
E01 1680 rest against the back of your neck); extend your feet forward and
E01 1690 backward until you are in a deep leg split.   Now raise the weight
E01 1700 by {straightening} your {front} leg, {without moving your
E01 1710 feet}. When the front knee is straight and {locked}, allow it
E01 1720 to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the
E01 1730 sides of the Power Stands. _3._ After you have taken a breather,
E01 1740 {reverse} the position of your legs so that the {front} thigh
E01 1750 of the {previous} exercise is now to the {rear}, and the
E01 1760 {rear} thigh now to the {front}, and perform the same movement
E01 1770 in the same manner.   That's the One-Leg Lunge in a nutshell.
E01 1780 You should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you
E01 1790 make your first
E01 1800 experiments **h just for safety. You should also begin
E01 1810 this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed
E01 1820 to it balance-wise.   Oh, you'll wobble and weave quite a bit
E01 1830 at first. But don't worry. Before your first training experiment
E01 1840 has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it
E01 1850 you'll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran!
E01 1860    Although I suggested that you hold the bar at the {back} of
E01 1870 the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't make some experiments
E01 1880 with the bar held in {front} of the neck. Squat-style lifters and
E01 1890 leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those
E01 1900 variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the
E01 1910 {left} and {right} leg to the {front}.
E02 0010    THE MOST BEAUTIFUL bed of pansies I've seen was in a South
E02 0020 Dakota yard on a sizzling day. Pansies are supposed to like it
E02 0030 cool, but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring
E02 0040 sun. I sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce
E02 0050 such beauties in that weather. He seemed puzzled by my question.
E02 0060 "I just love them", he said.   The more I talked with him,
E02 0070 the more convinced I became that that was the secret of their riotous
E02 0080 blooming. Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care.
E02 0090 He planted the pansy seeds himself, buying them from a pansy specialist.
E02 0100 These specialists, I learned, have done a great deal of work to
E02 0110 improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers. Their
E02 0120 seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the
E02 0130 unimproved strains.   I asked him if he took seeds from his own
E02 0140 plants. Occasionally, when he had an unusual flower that he wanted
E02 0150 more of he did; but pansy seeds, he told me, soon "run down". It's
E02 0160 best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them.
E02 0170    His soil was "nothing special", just prairie land, but
E02 0180 he had harrowed in compost until it was loose, spongy and brown-black.
E02 0190 I fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the
E02 0200 right texture, tilth and body. It isn't easy to describe it, but every
E02 0210 gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil.   Nothing
E02 0220 is easier to grow from seed than pansies. They germinate quickly, the
E02 0230 tiny plants appearing in a week, and grow along lustily. It doesn't
E02 0240 really matter which month of the year you sow them, but they germinate
E02 0250 best when they have a wide variation of temperature, very warm followed
E02 0260 by cool in the same 24 hours.   I like to make a seedbed
E02 0270 right in the open, though many people start them successfully in cold
E02 0280 frames. Pansies don't have to be coddled; they'd rather have things
E02 0290 rugged, with only moderate protection on the coldest days. If you
E02 0300 do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate.
E02 0310    For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little sand added to
E02 0320 encourage rooting. I dig it, rake it smooth, sow the seeds and wet them
E02 0330 down with a fog spray. Then I cover the sowing with a board. This
E02 0340 keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds. Ants carry away
E02 0350 the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby.
E02 0360    When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove the board. A
E02 0370 light, porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft
E02 0380 during these early days of growth. I like sawdust for this, or hay.
E02 0390    When they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants, it's
E02 0400 time to set them out where they are to remain. Every time you transplant
E02 0410 a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller. The moral is:
E02 0420 don't transplant it any oftener than you must. As soon as they
E02 0430 are large enough to move, I put mine 9 inches apart where they are
E02 0440 to bloom. I put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed
E02 0450 bone meal into each hole with the plant. That encourages rooting, and
E02 0460 the better developed the roots, the larger and more plentiful the flowers.
E02 0470    Pansies are gluttons. I doubt if it is possible to overfeed
E02 0480 them. I spade lots of compost into their bed; lacking that,
E02 0490 decayed manure spread over the bed is fine. One year I simply set the
E02 0500 plants in the remains of a compost pile, to which a little sand had
E02 0510 been added, and I had the most beautiful pansies in my, or any of my
E02 0520 neighbors' experience. In addition to the rich soil they benefit by
E02 0530 feedings of manure water every other week, diluted to the color of weak
E02 0540 tea. As a substitute for this, organic fertilizer dissolved in water
E02 0550 to half the strength in the directions, may be used.   They
E02 0560 need mulch. We put a light mulch over the seedlings; now we must use
E02 0570 a heavy one. Three inches of porous material will do a good job of
E02 0580 keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool.   When winter comes
E02 0590 be ready with additional mulch. I like hay for this and apply it
E02 0600 so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost. That
E02 0610 keeps in the cold, retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate
E02 0620 freezing and thawing.   Don't miss the pansies that appear
E02 0630 from time to time through the winter. Whenever there is a thaw or
E02 0640 a few sunny days, you'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or
E02 0650 two. If those aren't enough for you, why not grow some just for winter
E02 0660 blooming? The pansies I cherished most bloomed for me in February
E02 0670 during a particularly cold winter. I started the seed in a flat
E02 0680 in June and set out the little pansies in a cold frame. (An unheated
E02 0690 greenhouse would have been better, if I had had one.) The plants
E02 0700 took zero nights in their stride, with nothing but a mat of straw over
E02 0710 the glass to protect them. In response to the lengthening days of February
E02 0720 they budded, then bloomed their 4-inch velvety flowers. That
E02 0730 cold frame was my morale builder; its mass of bright bloom set in a
E02 0740 border of snow made my spirits rise every time I looked at it. Like
E02 0750 strawberries in December, pansies are far more exciting in February
E02 0760 than in May. Try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold
E02 0770 and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it.
E02 0780    The day will come, in midsummer, when you find your plants becoming
E02 0790 "leggy", running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms.
E02 0800 Try pegging down each separate branch to the earth, using a bobby
E02 0810 pin to hold it there. Pick the flowers, keep the soil dampened, and
E02 0820 each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little
E02 0830 plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season. As soon as an experimental
E02 0840 tug assures you that roots have taken over, cut it off from
E02 0850 the mother plant.   A second and also good practice is to shear
E02 0860 off the tops, leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each
E02 0870 branch. These cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time
E02 0880 and will behave just as they did in early spring. I like to shear half
E02 0890 my plants at a time, leaving one half of them to blossom while the
E02 0900 second half is getting started on its new round of blooming.   Probably
E02 0910 no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to
E02 0920 let the blossoms go to seed. Nature's aim, different from ours, is
E02 0930 to provide for the coming generation. That done, her work is accomplished
E02 0940 and she ignores the plant.   Here is a word of advice when
E02 0950 you go shopping for your pansy seeds. Go to a reputable grower, preferably
E02 0960 a pansy specialist. It is no harder to raise big, healthy, blooming
E02 0970 plants than weak, sickly little things; in fact it is easier. But
E02 0980 you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow.   Many
E02 0990 people think that pansies last only a few weeks, then their period
E02 1000 of growth and bloom is over. That is not true. If the plants are cared
E02 1010 for and protected over the winter, the second year is more prolific
E02 1020 than the first.   Would you like to grow exhibition pansies?
E02 1030 Remove about half the branches from each plant, leaving only the strongest
E02 1040 with the largest buds. The flowers will be huge.   Pansies
E02 1050 have character. They stick to their principles, insist upon their
E02 1060 due, but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it. Treat
E02 1070 them right and they'll make a showing every month in the year except
E02 1080 the frigid ones. Give them food, some shade, mulch, water and more
E02 1081 food, and they'll repay your solicitude with beauty.
E02 1090    A SALAD WITH
E02 1100 greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition
E02 1110 to a meal, but add an avocado and you have something really special.
E02 1120 This delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past
E02 1130 thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible
E02 1140 to ship avocado anywhere in the United States. It has a great
E02 1150 many assets to recommend it and if you haven't made avocado a part
E02 1160 of your diet yet, you really should.   You will find that avocado
E02 1170 is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted. It is roughly shaped
E02 1180 like a large pear, and when properly ripened, its dark green skin covers
E02 1190 a meaty, melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe
E02 1200 Bartlett pear, but oily. The avocado should have a "give" to it,
E02 1210 as you hold it, when it is ripe. The flavor is neither sweet, like
E02 1220 a pear, nor tart like an orange; it is subtle and rather bland, nut-like.
E02 1230 It is a flavor that might take a little getting used to- not
E02 1240 because it is unpleasant, but because the flavor is hard to define in
E02 1250 the light of our experience with other fruits. Sometimes it takes several
E02 1260 "eatings" of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste
E02 1270 that has made it such a favorite throughout the world. Once you become
E02 1280 an avocado fan, you will look forward to the season each year with
E02 1290 eager anticipation. #NATURALLY DORMANT AND NO SPRAY DANGER# Today,
E02 1300 refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible
E02 1310 to any place in the world. The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree,
E02 1320 but it is still firm at this point. It is brought to packing houses,
E02 1330 cleaned and graded as to size and quality, and packed in protective
E02 1340 excelsior. The fruit is then cooled to 42`F&, a temperature at which
E02 1350 it lapses into a sort of dormant state. This cooling does not change
E02 1360 the avocado in any way, it just delays the natural softening of
E02 1370 the fruit until a grovelike temperature (room temperature) is restored.
E02 1380 This happens on the grocer's shelf or in your kitchen.   One
E02 1390 of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require
E02 1400 processing of any kind. There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing
E02 1410 needed. If the temperature is controlled properly, the avocado will delay
E02 1420 its ripening until needed. And unlike other fruits, one cannot eat
E02 1430 the skin of the avocado. It is thick, much like an egg plant's skin,
E02 1440 so that poison sprays, if they are used, present no hazard to the
E02 1450 consumer. #NUTRITIOUS AND A CHOLESTEROL REDUCER# Good taste and
E02 1460 versatility,
E02 1470 plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend
E02 1480 the frequent use of such a fruit, even if its nutritional values were
E02 1490 limited. Avocados, however, are very rich in nutrients. Their main
E02 1500 asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids, so necessary for maintaining
E02 1510 the good health of the circulatory system. Aside from this,
E02 1520 the average portion contains some protein, an appreciable amount of vitamins
E02 1530 ~A and ~C- about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement,
E02 1540 and about a third of the official vitamin ~E requirement. The
E02 1550 ~B vitamins are well represented, especially thiamin and riboflavin.
E02 1560 Calcium, phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts,
E02 1570 and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts.
E02 1580 None of these values is destroyed, not significantly altered by refrigeration
E02 1590 storage.   Dr& Wilson C& Grant, of the Veterans'
E02 1600 Administration Hospital, Coral Gables, Florida, and the University
E02 1610 of Miami School of Medicine, set out to discover if avocados,
E02 1620 because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids, would reduce
E02 1630 the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients. The study comprised
E02 1640 16 male patients, ranging in age from 27 to 72. They were put
E02 1650 on control diets to determine as accurately as possible, the normal cholesterol
E02 1660 level of their blood. Then they were given 1/2 to 1-1/2 avocados
E02 1670 per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption.
E03 0010    FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE, FIRE! The tremendous energy
E03 0020 released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than
E03 0030 it can be heard. The pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the
E03 0040 pit of your stomach.   Never before has the introduction of a weapon
E03 0050 caused so much apprehension and fear. Nuclear weapons are fearsome,
E03 0060 but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless
E03 0070 swiftness which is much more terrifying.   A great many writers
E03 0080 are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker
E03 0090 would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear
E03 0100 rockets. It is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that
E03 0110 an attacker, in possession of such absolute power, would simultaneously
E03 0120 destroy his opponent's cities and people. With a nation defenseless
E03 0130 before it, why would the attacker spare the victim's people?
E03 0140 Wouldn't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical
E03 0150 act of complete subjugation? The nation would be utterly devastated.
E03 0160 The will of its people, so crucial in time of peril, would be broken.
E03 0170    Nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction
E03 0180 in hours or days; and now rockets have given it the means
E03 0190 to destroy itself in minutes. At this point it should be painfully obvious
E03 0200 that cities, being "soft", and the people within them are ideally
E03 0210 suited to destruction by nuclear weapons.   However, because
E03 0220 this vulnerability is mutual, it is to the advantage of neither side
E03 0230 to destroy the opponent's cities, at least so long as the opponent
E03 0240 has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal. It should be appallingly
E03 0250 apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic.
E03 0260    ~ICBMs have given us a capability which could be used in
E03 0270 two different ways. They could be used to attack a nation's people
E03 0280 (which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker's own people),
E03 0290 or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy's military
E03 0300 force.   If our national interest lies in being able to
E03 0310 fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide, then we must
E03 0320 take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles. We must
E03 0330 determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves. We must make
E03 0340 certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job
E03 0350 to the missile.   Missiles are very valuable weapons, but they
E03 0360 also have their too little known limitations.   Because of a missile's
E03 0370 ballistic trajectory, the location of a fixed target must be
E03 0380 known quite accurately. Placing missiles in submarines, on barges, railroads,
E03 0390 highways, surface vessels and in the air provides them with
E03 0400 passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range
E03 0410 ballistic missiles today- the extreme difficulty of destroying
E03 0420 a mobile or moving target with such weapons. One must first <detect>
E03 0430 a fleeting mobile or moving target, <decide> that it is worthy of
E03 0440 destruction, <select> the missile to be fired against the target,
E03 0450 <compute> ballistics for the flight, and <prepare> the missile for
E03 0460 firing.   Even if all these operations could be performed <instantaneously>,
E03 0470 the ~ICBM still has a time of flight to the target
E03 0480 of about 30 minutes. Therefore, if the target can significantly change
E03 0490 its location in something less than 30 minutes, the probability of
E03 0500 having destroyed it is drastically lowered.   Because of this,
E03 0510 it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic
E03 0520 missiles will seek self-protection in mobility- at least until missile
E03 0530 defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability.
E03 0540    In order to destroy the enemy's mobile, moving, or imprecisely
E03 0550 located strategic forces, we must have a hunter-killer capability
E03 0560 <in addition> to our missiles. Until this hunter-killer operation
E03 0570 can be performed by spacecraft, manned aircraft appear to be the only
E03 0580 means available to us.   It seems reasonable that if general
E03 0590 nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other's
E03 0600 citizens to cinders, we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance
E03 0610 aircraft capable of going into China or Russia to find and
E03 0620 destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us.
E03 0630 Let us suppose the Russians decide to build a rail-mobile ~ICBM
E03 0640 force. It is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the ~B-52
E03 0650 or ~B-70 in hunter-killer operations against Soviet railway-based
E03 0660 missiles. If we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton
E03 0670 nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which
E03 0680 may be more appropriate for most important military targets, it would
E03 0690 seem that the ~B-52 or ~B-70 could carry a great many small
E03 0700 nuclear weapons.   An aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons
E03 0710 could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains
E03 0720 operating within a specified geographic area of Russia- provided that
E03 0730 we had used some of our ~ICBMs to degrade Russia's air defenses
E03 0740 before our bombers got there. The aircraft could be used to destroy
E03 0750 other mobile, fleeting, and imprecisely located targets as well as
E03 0760 the known, fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by
E03 0770 missile.   Why, then, aren't we planning a larger, more important
E03 0780 role for manned military aircraft? Is there any other way to do
E03 0790 the job?   Survivability of our strategic forces (Polaris,
E03 0800 mobile and hardened Minuteman, hardened Atlas and Titan, and airborne
E03 0810 Skybolt) means that it will take some time, perhaps weeks, to destroy
E03 0820 a strategic force. War, under these circumstances, cannot be one
E03 0830 massive exchange of nuclear devastation. Forces <will survive> a surprise
E03 0840 attack, and these forces will give depth, or considerable duration,
E03 0850 to the conflict. ## THE forces which survive the initial
E03 0851 attack
E03 0860 must be found and destroyed. Even mobile forces must be found and
E03 0870 destroyed. But, how does one go about the job of finding and destroying
E03 0880 mobile forces? They are not susceptible to wholesale destruction
E03 0890 by ballistic missile.   Some day, many years in the future, true
E03 0900 spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets. But until
E03 0910 we have an effective spacecraft, the answer to the hunter-killer
E03 0920 problem is manned aircraft.   However, the aircraft which we have
E03 0930 today are tied to large, "soft" airfields. Nuclear rockets can
E03 0940 destroy airfields with ease. Here then is our problem: aircraft are
E03 0950 vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions
E03 0960 which a missile is totally incapable of performing; but the airfield,
E03 0970 on which the aircraft is completely dependent, is doomed by the missile.
E03 0980 This makes today's aircraft a one-shot, or one mission, weapon.
E03 0990 Aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once.
E03 1000    This is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft
E03 1010 in favor of the missile. But remember this- it isn't the <aircraft>
E03 1020 which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets, it is the <airfield>.
E03 1030 Eliminate the <vulnerability of aircraft on the ground> and you
E03 1040 have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic
E03 1050 missiles.   There are <four rather obvious ways> to reduce or
E03 1060 eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground:   @ Put
E03 1070 aircraft in "bomb-proof" hangars when they are on the ground.
E03 1080    @ Build long-range aircraft which can take off from small (3,000-foot)
E03 1090 airfields with runways. If we could use all the small airfields
E03 1100 we have in this country, we could disperse our strategic aircraft
E03 1110 by a factor of 10 or more.   @ Use nuclear propulsions to keep
E03 1120 our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their
E03 1130 useful life.   @ Using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines,
E03 1140 develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing (~VTOL) long-range
E03 1150 military aircraft.   We have the technology today with which to
E03 1160 build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 ~psi. We
E03 1170 could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters.
E03 1171 Large,
E03 1180 long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability
E03 1190 to take off from 3,000-foot runways, but they would require more powerful
E03 1200 engines than we have today. There is little enthusiasm for spending
E03 1210 money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief
E03 1220 that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile.   This
E03 1230 same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted
E03 1240 in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft.
E03 1250 One seldom hears the analogy "nuclear propulsion will do for
E03 1260 the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine".   If,
E03 1270 for some reason such as economy, we are not going to develop aircraft
E03 1280 nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency, then we should
E03 1290 turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio
E03 1300 of 12 or 15 to one. With powerplants such as these, vertical takeoff
E03 1310 and landing combat aircraft could be built. For example, a 12-to-one
E03 1320 engine would power a <supersonic> ~VTOL fighter. With a 15-to-one
E03 1330 engine, a supersonic aircraft weighing 300,000 pounds could rise
E03 1340 vertically. The reason that we are not going ahead full speed to
E03 1350 develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a
E03 1360 billion dollars- and you don't spend that sort of money if aircraft
E03 1370 are obsolete.   When aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields,
E03 1380 they are no longer vulnerable to ~ICBMs. If our ~SAC
E03 1390 bombers were, today, capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and
E03 1400 <because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability
E03 1410 to strike at Russia again, and again, and again>, those bombers would
E03 1420 unquestionably assure our military dominance.   We would have
E03 1430 the means to seek out and destroy the enemy's force- whether it
E03 1440 were fixed or mobile. With such a force of manned bombers we could bring
E03 1450 enormous pressure to bear on an enemy, and this pressure would be
E03 1460 selective and extremely discriminating. No need to kill an entire city
E03 1470 and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance
E03 1480 to selectively disarm the enemy's military force.   Our first
E03 1490 necessity, at the very outset of war, is post-attack reconnaissance.
E03 1500 In a few years we will have ~SAMOS (semiautomatic missile observation
E03 1510 system). But in the case of moving targets, and targets which
E03 1520 have limited mobility, what will their location be when it is time to
E03 1530 destroy them? What targets have we successfully knocked out? A
E03 1540 ballistic missile cannot, today, tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful.
E03 1550 What targets still remain to be hit? These crucial questions
E03 1560 must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance. ~SAMOS will
E03 1570 be hard put to see through clouds- and to see in the dark.
E03 1580 Even if this is some day possible, there remains the 30-minute time
E03 1590 of flight of a missile to its overseas target. If the target can change
E03 1600 its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in
E03 1610 the air on its way, the probability of the missile destroying the target
E03 1620 is drastically reduced.   <Pre>-attack reconnaissance is vital
E03 1630 but only <post>-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate
E03 1640 the war favorably. It would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather
E03 1650 that post-attack reconnaissance. It could operate under the clouds
E03 1660 and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night.
E03 1670 It would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately
E03 1680 destroy any targets it discovered- no need to wait for a missile
E03 1690 to come all the way from the United States with the chance that
E03 1700 the target, if it were mobile, would be gone.   A large aircraft,
E03 1710 such as the ~B-52 or ~B-70, could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small
E03 1720 nuclear weapons. Few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive
E03 1730 power will create 1,000 ~psi overpressure at 100 feet. Or
E03 1731 put
E03 1740 another way, the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed
E03 1750 by placing a one-kiloton warhead (1/20th the size of those used in Hiroshima
E03 1760 and Nagasaki) within 100 to 200 feet of the target!
E03 1770    It is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large
E03 1780 yield nuclear weapons.   Today we have side-looking radar which
E03 1790 has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual
E03 1800 buildings, runways, taxi-ways, separate spans of bridges, etc&.
E03 1810 With these keen "eyes" and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy,
E03 1820 military forces can be directly attacked <with minimum damage
E03 1830 to urban areas>.   If we fail to develop the means to hunt down
E03 1840 and destroy the enemy's military force with extreme care and precision,
E03 1850 and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace,
E03 1860 our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening.
E04 0010    THE LYRIC BEAUTIES of Schubert's <Trout> Quintet-
E04 0020 its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies- make it a source
E04 0030 of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners. But for students of
E04 0040 musical forms and would-be classifiers, the work presents its problems.
E04 0050 Since it requires only five players, it would seem to fall into the
E04 0060 category of chamber music- yet it calls for a double bass, an instrument
E04 0070 generally regarded as symphonic. Moreover, the piece is written
E04 0080 in five movements, rather than the conventional four of most quintets,
E04 0090 and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor.   The
E04 0100 many and frequent performances of the <Trout> serve to emphasize
E04 0110 the dual nature of its writing. Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions,
E04 0120 with the contrabass given free rein. Other interpretations present
E04 0130 the music as an essentially intimate creation. In these readings,
E04 0140 the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background, or it
E04 0150 is dressed in clown's attire- the musical equivalent of a bull in
E04 0160 a china shop. Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches,
E04 0170 when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer
E04 0180 than ten different performances. The occasion for this marathon:
E04 0190 Angel's long-awaited reissue in its "Great Recordings of the
E04 0200 Century" series of the Schnabel-Pro Arte version. Let me say at
E04 0210 the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as
E04 0220 it did on the first.   Whether considered alone or in relation
E04 0230 to other editions, ~COLH 40 is a document of prime importance.
E04 0240 Artur Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart
E04 0250 players of all time, and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable.
E04 0260 But Schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great
E04 0270 performer, and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to
E04 0280 are by Schnabel pupils (Clifford Curzon, Frank Glazer, Adrian Aeschbacher,
E04 0290 and Victor Babin) also sheds light on the master's pedagogical
E04 0300 skills. Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian
E04 0310 renditions, most notably the "Schnabel trill" (which differs
E04 0320 from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously).
E04 0330 But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel's distinction
E04 0340 as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each
E04 0350 student's approach as distinctly his own.   Schnabel's emphasis
E04 0360 on structural clarity, his innate rhythmic vibrancy, and impetuous
E04 0370 intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one. Yet no
E04 0380 detail was too small to receive attention from this master, and as a
E04 0390 result the playing here has humor, delicacy, and radiant humanity. This
E04 0400 is a serious-minded interpretation, but it is never strait-laced. And
E04 0410 although Schnabel's pianism bristles with excitement, it is meticulously
E04 0420 faithful to Schubert's dynamic markings and phrase indications.
E04 0430 The piano performance on this <Trout> is one that really demands
E04 0440 a search for superlatives.   About the Pro Arte's contribution
E04 0450 I am less happy. I, for one, rather regret that Schnabel didn't
E04 0460 collaborate with the Budapest Quartet, whose rugged, athletic
E04 0470 playing was a good deal closer to this pianist's interpretative outlook
E04 0480 than the style of the Belgian group. From a technical standpoint,
E04 0490 the string playing is good, but the Pro Arte people fail to enter
E04 0500 into the spirit of things here. The violinist, in particular, is very
E04 0510 indulgent with swoops and slides, and his tone is pinched and edgy.
E04 0520 The twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone,
E04 0530 but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very
E04 0540 quiet. There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation
E04 0550 in the "<Forellen>" movement, and I suspect that this is
E04 0560 due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original ~SPs.
E04 0570    Turning to the more modern versions, Curzon's (London) offers
E04 0580 the most sophisticated keyboard work. Every detail in his interpretation
E04 0590 has been beautifully thought out, and of these I would especially
E04 0600 cite the delicious <la^ndler> touch the pianist brings to the fifth
E04 0610 variation (an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese
E04 0620 musicians), and the gossamer shading throughout. Some of Curzon's
E04 0630 playing strikes me as finicky, however. Why, for example, does he favor
E04 0640 <two> tempos, rather than one, for the third movement? The assisting
E04 0650 musicians from the Vienna Octet are somewhat lacking in <expertise>,
E04 0660 but their contribution is rustic and appealing. (Special compliments
E04 0670 to the double bass playing of Johann Krumpp: his scrawny,
E04 0680 tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance.)
E04 0690    The Glazer-Fine Arts edition (Concert-Disc) is a model of lucidity
E04 0700 and organization. It is, moreover, a perfectly integrated ensemble
E04 0710 effort. But having lived with the disc for some time now, I find
E04 0720 the performance less exciting than either Schnabel's or Fleisher's
E04 0730 (whose superb performance with the Budapest Quartet has still to
E04 0740 be recorded) and a good deal less filled with humor than Curzon's.
E04 0750 Aeschbacher's work is very much akin to Schnabel's, but the sound
E04 0760 on his Decca disc is dated, and you will have a hard time locating
E04 0770 a copy of it.   The Hephzibah Menuhin-Amadeus Quartet (Angel)
E04 0780 and Victor Babin-Festival Quartet (~RCA Victor) editions
E04 0790 give us superlative string playing (both in symphonic style) crippled
E04 0800 by unimaginative piano playing. (Babin has acquired some of Schnabel's
E04 0810 keyboard manner, but his playing is of limited insight.) Badura-Skoda-Vienna
E04 0820 Konzerthaus (Westminster) and Demus-Schubert Quartet
E04 0830 (Deutsche Grammophon) are both warm-toned, pleasantly lyrical,
E04 0840 but rather slack and tensionless. Helmut Roloff, playing with a group
E04 0850 of musicians from the Bayreuth Ensemble, gives a sturdy reading, in
E04 0860 much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists. Telefunken
E04 0870 has accorded him beautiful sound, and this bargain-priced disc (it
E04 0880 sells for $2.98) is worthy of consideration.   Returning once again
E04 0890 to the Schnabel reissue, I am beguiled anew by the magnificence
E04 0900 of this pianist's musical penetration. Here is truly a "Great Recording
E04 0910 of the Century", and its greatness is by no means diminished
E04 0920 by the fact that it is not quite perfect. This recording surely belongs
E04 0930 in everyone's collection.
E04 0940 MUST records always sound like records?   From the beginning
E04 0950 of commercial recording, new discs purported to be indistinguishable
E04 0960 from The Real Thing have regularly been put in circulation. Seen
E04 0970 in perspective, many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones.
E04 0980 Although lacking absolute verisimilitude, they supply the
E04 0990 ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation
E04 1000 of the original. On the basis of what they give us we can know how the
E04 1010 young Caruso sang, appreciate the distinctive qualities of <Parsifal>
E04 1020 under Karl Muck's baton, or sense the type of ensemble Toscanini
E04 1030 created in his years with the New York Philharmonic.   Since
E04 1040 the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago,
E04 1050 the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold. In many
E04 1060 cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational
E04 1070 effects: the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning
E04 1080 as the gap between sound and substance became clearer. Other
E04 1090 innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing
E04 1100 to acquire in time the status of classics. If we return to them today,
E04 1110 we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them
E04 1120 still pleasing.   Records sound like records because they provide
E04 1130 a different sort of experience than live music. This difference is
E04 1140 made up of many factors. Some of them are obvious, such as the fact
E04 1150 that we associate recorded and live music with our reponses and behavior
E04 1160 in different types of environments and social settings. (Music often
E04 1170 sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit in something
E04 1180 more comfortable than a theatre seat.) From the technical standpoint,
E04 1190 records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey
E04 1200 the true color, texture, complexity, range, intensity, pulse, and pitch
E04 1210 of the original. Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion,
E04 1220 although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced
E04 1230 that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests.
E04 1240 Yet it is the accumulation of distortion, the fitting together of
E04 1250 fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness,
E04 1260 that makes records sound like records. The sound may be good;
E04 1270 but if you know The Real Thing, you know that what you are hearing
E04 1280 is only a clever imitation.   Command's new Brahms Second is
E04 1290 a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather
E04 1300 than a copy of one. Like the recent <Scheherazade> from London
E04 1310 (HIGH FIDELITY, Sept& 1961), it is successful because emphasis
E04 1320 has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than
E04 1330 on creating sensational effects. Because of this, only those with
E04 1340 truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the
E04 1350 engineers' triumph.   The easiest way to describe this release
E04 1360 is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg
E04 1370 performance with minimal alteration of its musical values. The engineering
E04 1380 as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness. The effect of
E04 1390 the recording is very open and natural, with the frequency emphasis
E04 1400 exactly what you would expect from a live performance. This absence of
E04 1410 peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity, but
E04 1420 it eliminates listener fatigue. A contributing factor is the perspective,
E04 1430 the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained. The orchestra
E04 1440 is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes, valve
E04 1450 clicks, and other noises incidental to playing. Yet you feel the orchestra
E04 1460 is near at hand, and the individual instruments have the same firm
E04 1470 presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically
E04 1480 perfect hall. Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation.
E04 1490 The music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its
E04 1500 full sonority; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer. The
E04 1510 timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance.
E04 1520    All of this would be wasted, of course, if the performance lacked
E04 1530 authority and musical distinction. For me it has more of both elements
E04 1540 than the majority of its competitors. Steinberg seems to have gone
E04 1550 directly back to the score, discounting tradition, and has built his
E04 1560 performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly
E04 1570 what Brahms set down on paper.   Those accustomed to broader,
E04 1580 more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react
E04 1590 strongly when they hear this one. Without losing the distinctive undertow
E04 1600 of Brahmsian rhythm, the pacing is firm and the over-all performance
E04 1610 has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect.
E04 1620 The <Presto ma non assai> of the first trio of the scherzo is
E04 1630 taken literally and may shock you, as the real <Allegro con spirito>
E04 1640 of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet. In the end, however,
E04 1650 the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way
E04 1660 it sings. Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element
E04 1670 which must dominate in this score, and he manages at times to create
E04 1680 the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song.   The
E04 1690 engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result. Too
E04 1700 many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody
E04 1710 and its accompaniment. The Command technique invites you to listen
E04 1720 to the depth of the orchestration. Your ear takes you into the ensemble,
E04 1730 and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously
E04 1740 were apparent only in the score. It is this sort of experience
E04 1750 that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance
E04 1760 for the home music listener.
E04 1770 The first substantially complete stereo <Giselle> (and the only one
E04 1780 of its scope since Feyer's four-sided ~LP edition of 1958 for
E04 1790 Angel), this set is, I'm afraid, likely to provide more horrid fascination
E04 1800 than enjoyment. The already faded pastel charms of the nai^ve
E04 1810 music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari's melodramatic contrasts
E04 1820 between ultravehement brute power and chilly, if suave, sentimentality.
E04 1830 And in its engineers' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic
E04 1840 impact and earsplitting brilliance, the recording sounds as though
E04 1850 it had been "doctored for super-high fidelity". The home listener
E04 1860 is overpowered, all right, but the experience is a far from pleasant
E04 1870 one. As with the penultimate <Giselle> release (Wolff's abridgment
E04 1880 for ~RCA Victor) I find the cleaner, less razor-edged
E04 1885 monophonic
E04 1890 version, for all its lack of big-stage spaciousness, the more
E04 1900 aurally tolerable- but this may be the result of processing defects
E04 1910 in my ~SD copies.
E05 0010    At the Westminster ~KC Dog Show in Madison Square Garden,
E05 0020 New York on the second day, the Finals of the Junior Class
E05 0030 brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this Class.
E05 0040 The Class had entries from as far west as Wisconsin and as far
E05 0050 south as Kentucky. This year several entries from Canada were entered
E05 0060 which made the Junior Class International.   Forty-six of
E05 0070 the 53 Juniors who mailed in entries were present. It was interesting
E05 0080 to note that many of these Juniors were showing dogs in various other
E05 0090 classes at the show prior to the Finals of the Junior Class.
E05 0100    As has been the custom for the past several years, John Cross,
E05 0110 Jr&, Bench Show Chmn& of Westminster, arranged for the Juniors'
E05 0120 meeting before the Class, and invited two speakers from the dog
E05 0130 world to address them. Over 60 Juniors, parents and guests attended.
E05 0140 #MRS& WILLIAM H& LONG, JR& SPEAKS# After the Juniors
E05 0150 were welcomed and congratulated for qualifying for the Finals of the
E05 0160 Junior Class, Mrs& William H& Long, Jr& was introduced as
E05 0170 the first speaker.   In her opening remarks Mrs& Long also
E05 0180 welcomed the Juniors and stated, "There isn't any other show quite
E05 0190 like Westminster. I know because this is my 37th year with hardly
E05 0200 a break. Mrs& Long still feels the same unique spirit of Westminster
E05 0210 which she stated the present Juniors will experience today but probably
E05 0220 will not appreciate in full for a number of years.   Twenty
E05 0230 years ago her daughter Betsey Long, then 13 years of age, won the
E05 0240 Grand Challenge Trophy, Children's Handling Class (as they were
E05 0250 called then) at Westminster. No sooner had Betsey come out of the
E05 0260 ring than Mrs& Long walked into the Working Competition with
E05 0270 Ch& Cadet or Noranda, another home-bred product, and won!
E05 0280    Speaking from long years of experience, Mrs& Long advised the Juniors:
E05 0290 "<When showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement>,
E05 0300 STOP! Dogs have a way of sensing our feelings! When you and
E05 0310 your dog step into the Junior ring, it should be just what the dog
E05 0320 wants to do as much as what you want him to do. If you walk into the
E05 0330 ring because it is fun to show your dog, he will feel it and give you
E05 0340 a good performance! He knows your signals, what is expected of him
E05 0350 and the way the Class is conducted, right up through the flash-bulbs
E05 0360 of the photographers". #RIGHT ATTITUDE ESSENTIAL!# "Take
E05 0370 away your attitude", said Mrs& Long, "and what have you left?
E05 0380 Either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage- a sure sign
E05 0390 that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop! Or a
E05 0400 bored dog because you are more interested in something else- maybe
E05 0410 the way you look, or the date you have after the Class, or you are just
E05 0420 doing this to please the parents.   "The reason you are in
E05 0430 the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most
E05 0440 attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can
E05 0450 produce. Aids sounds more like a Pony Club, or horsemanship classes-
E05 0460 riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar!   "Your
E05 0470 aids are your attitude, which comes through your voice, your hands
E05 0480 and legs- voice to encourage, discourage or whatever the need may
E05 0490 be; hands to guide or restrain; legs to produce motion and rate of
E05 0500 speed. Without right attitude the other aids just do not work right".
E05 0510    Mrs& Long wished all the Juniors luck in the Class and
E05 0520 stated, "Have fun! And may you all continue to show at Westminster
E05 0530 in the years to come"! #HARVEY BARCUS, SECOND SPEAKER# The
E05 0540 second speaker was Harvey Barcus, President of the Dog Writers
E05 0550 Ass'n of America.   Mr& Barcus spoke on the subject of
E05 0560 scholarships for Juniors- with which he is very familiar. Last year
E05 0570 a boy he knows and helped in Journalism won the Thoroughbred Racing
E05 0580 Ass'n Scholarship which is worth $10,000. He gave a resume of
E05 0590 the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship.
E05 0600    "Junior Showmanship is an extremely worthy project and
E05 0610 should be earnestly encouraged"! is one of Mr& Barcus' strong
E05 0620 beliefs. He feels very forcibly that the American Kennel Club should
E05 0630 take a MORE ACTIVE part in encouraging the Junior Division!
E05 0640    In closing, Mr& Barcus also wished all the Juniors
E05 0650 luck in their Class. #WESTMINSTER SHOW NOTES# Instead of 3 a&m&
E05 0660 in the past, the Juniors Class at Westminster was held at 4:45
E05 0670 p&m&. This gave the Juniors the use of the entire ring at the
E05 0680 show- a great advantage to them!   Before the Juniors entered
E05 0690 the ring the Steward announced that after all Juniors had moved
E05 0700 their dogs around the ring and set them up, they could relax with their
E05 0710 dogs. From there on, each Junior was going to be judged individually.
E05 0720 This thoughtful gesture was well received by the Juniors as the
E05 0730 Class had an entry of 46 Juniors and it took approximately one hour,
E05 0740 45 minutes to judge the Class. #ANNE HONE ROGERS JUDGES 28TH FINALS#
E05 0750 This year Anne Hone Rogers, outstanding Handler, judged the
E05 0760 Class. This is the third time in 28 years of Junior Showmanship at
E05 0770 Westminster that a lady Handler has judged the Class.   As the
E05 0780 Juniors entered the ring, Mr& Spring, the announcer, stated over
E05 0790 the public-address system that this was the 28th year that Westminster
E05 0800 has held the Finals of the Junior Competition. Juniors competed
E05 0810 last year at American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club recognized
E05 0820 shows to be eligible to compete in this Class- the Finals
E05 0830 for the year. A Junior who won two or more wins in the Open Class
E05 0840 was eligible.   (The purpose of the Junior Showmanship Competition
E05 0850 is to teach and encourage Juniors to become good sportsmen. Many
E05 0860 adults showing at Westminster today are products of this Class.)
E05 0870    It seemed an almost impossible job for Miss Rogers to select
E05 0880 4 winners from the 46 Juniors entered. A large number of these Juniors
E05 0890 have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners.
E05 0900    After the judge moved all the dogs individually, she selected
E05 0910 several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring. She
E05 0920 then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship.
E05 0930 #INTERNATIONAL CHAMPION OF THE YEAR# BETTY LOU HAM,
E05 0935 age
E05 0940 16, Holyoke, Mass&, showing an Irish Setter, was chosen as International
E05 0950 Champion of the year. She was awarded the Professional Handlers'
E05 0960 Ass'ns' LEONARD BRUMBY, SR& Memorial Trophy
E05 0970 (named for the FOUNDER-ORIGINATOR of the Junior Classes.)
E05 0980    Betty is 16 years of age and had several wins to her credit
E05 0990 last year. In addition to showing an Irish Setter throughout the year,
E05 1000 she also scored with an Afghan. #OTHER WINNERS# SYDNEY LE
E05 1010 BLANC, age 15, Staten Island, N&Y&, showing a Doberman Pinscher,
E05 1020 was 2nd.   SUSAN HACKMANN, age 14, from Baltimore,
E05 1030 Md&, showing a Dachshund, was 3rd. Last year Susan also placed
E05 1040 3rd in the Finals at Westminster. From the records we keep-
E05 1050 Susan is the only Junior who has placed in the Junior Classes in
E05 1060 both United States and Canada.   KAREN MARCMANN, age 16,
E05 1070 Trapp, Penna&, showing a Keeshond was 4th.   Most Juniors
E05 1080 who were entered in the Finals are seasoned campaigners and not only
E05 1090 show and win in Junior Classes but score in the Breed Classes as
E05 1100 well. #ENTRIES INCREASING- REQUIREMENTS RAISED# In 1960, there
E05 1110 were 7287 entries in the Junior Classes. Each year these shows have
E05 1120 increased in entries. Next year 1962, at Westminster, the Bench Show
E05 1130 Committee has raised the requirements so that a JUNIOR MUST WIN
E05 1140 3 OR MORE JUNIOR CLASSES IN THE OPEN DIVISION ONLY TO QUALIFY FOR WESTMINSTER.
E05 1150    PERCY ROBERTS, a leading judge will not be
E05 1160 at the International Show this year for the Junior Judging Contest
E05 1170 as he has been invited to judge in Australia in March. #JUDGING
E05 1180 CLASS FOR INTERMEDIATES PROPOSED# It has been suggested many times
E05 1190 that a Class be set up for the Juniors who are overage and cannot enter
E05 1200 the Junior Classes. For some time this writer has been suggesting
E05 1210 a Junior Judging Class for Intermediates over 16 and under 20 years
E05 1220 of age who are ineligible to compete in the Junior Class.
E05 1230    Such a Class was tried out successfully at the Westchester ~KC
E05 1240 Show recently. Not only were the contestants pleased with the Class,
E05 1250 but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day. The Intermediates
E05 1260 in the Class with the Judge were asked to pick 4 winners
E05 1270 and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice
E05 1280 of the Judge.   We suggested this Class in the horse world and
E05 1290 it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows
E05 1300 At the recent horse show convention in New York it was stated
E05 1310 that this Intermediate Judging Class is meeting with great success
E05 1320 and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world.
E05 1330 This Class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given
E05 1340 a chance. Last year Robert Harris, a leading Junior Handler entered
E05 1350 the Dog Judging Contest (Junior) at the International ~KC
E05 1360 of Chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any Junior
E05 1370 since the Class' inception. Juniors who attend this Chicago show
E05 1380 should make a point to enter this Class as it would be of great help
E05 1390 to them. #MORE VOLUNTEER HANDLERS NEEDED TO JUDGE# Superintendents
E05 1400 at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed
E05 1410 Handler to Judge Junior Showmanship Competition. The founder of
E05 1420 the Junior Showmanship Competition the late Leonard Brumby, Sr&
E05 1430 (for whom the trophy is named after at Westminster) was an outstanding
E05 1440 Handler and believed a Junior should have an opportunity to exhibit
E05 1450 in a dog show starting with the Junior Showmanship Division.
E05 1460    Some years ago this Class was judged by celebrities who knew
E05 1470 nothing of what was required of a Junior's ability to show a dog. To
E05 1480 overcome this unfair judging, the A&K&C& requires that a licensed
E05 1490 Handler be present to judge the Class. If the superintendents
E05 1500 do not receive more cooperation from Handlers, it has been suggested
E05 1510 that licensed Judges also be qualified to judge this Class. By recognizing
E05 1520 and helping Juniors get interested in the dog world, all will
E05 1530 be helping to create future dog owners. #OTHER AWARDS FOR JUNIORS#
E05 1535 The Airedale
E05 1540 Terrier Club of America and the Kerry Blue Terrier
E05 1550 Club of America have under consideration donating trophies to
E05 1560 the boys or girls who win with their breeds in Junior Showmanship Competition
E05 1570 at any Show. The Kansas City and the Topeka ~KCs
E05 1580 are arranging that Juniors who win at their shows will be qualified to
E05 1590 win points for Westminster. The Rio Grande ~KC is also considering
E05 1600 having their Junior Classes set up so that Juniors can qualify
E05 1610 with points for Westminster.   The American Pointer Club
E05 1620 is still continuing to donate a trophies to Juniors who win at Junior
E05 1630 Showmanship Classes with Pointers.
E05 1640    Traveling through the South- over 16,000 miles- with two
E05 1650 Great Danes, an Afghan, and a Persian kitten, we've worked up a
E05 1660 regular routine for acceptance at motels.   My husband enters the
E05 1670 motel office, signs up for a room, and them solemnly asks the proprieter
E05 1680 if he accepts pets. "Puppies"? comes the suspicious question.
E05 1690 "No", he replies, "full grown, adult show dogs, housebroken,
E05 1700 and obedience-trained".   We've never been refused!
E05 1710    Once settled, we're careful to walk the dogs in an out of the way
E05 1720 spot, keep them under control in the room, and feed and bench them where
E05 1730 they can't do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture.
E05 1740    In the morning we leave the room looking as neat as a pin!
E05 1750    Many a motel owner- when we've stopped there again- has remembered
E05 1760 us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children.
E05 1770    So many times I have wondered why veterinarians do not wipe the
E05 1780 table clean before each new canine patient is placed on it for examination.
E05 1790 Is it that they don't care? Are they indifferent to the
E05 1800 fact that the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding patient?
E06 0010    AT ONE TIME, to most Americans, unless they were fortunate
E06 0020 enough to live near a body of navigable water, boats were considered
E06 0030 the sole concern of fishermen, rich people, and the United States
E06 0040 Navy.   Today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening
E06 0050 statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport. There
E06 0060 are more than 8,000,000 recreational boats in use in the United States
E06 0070 with almost 10,000,000 the prediction for within the next decade.
E06 0080 About 40,000,000 people participated in boating in 1960. Boating has
E06 0090 become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining
E06 0100 sea. Boats are operated in every state in the Union, with the heaviest
E06 0110 concentrations along both coasts and in the Middle West.
E06 0120    The spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident,
E06 0130 expectedly, in the areas where boats have always been found: the natural
E06 0140 lakes, rivers, and along the nation's coastline. But during the
E06 0150 last several years boats were launched in areas where, a short time
E06 0160 ago, the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for
E06 0170 livestock.   Developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources
E06 0180 control program of the government, vast, man-made bodies of water represent
E06 0190 a kind of glorious fringe benefit, providing boating and fishing
E06 0200 havens all over the country.   No matter how determined or wealthy
E06 0210 boating lovers of the Southwest had been, for example, they could
E06 0220 never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile Lake
E06 0230 Texoma, located between Texas and Oklahoma, which resulted when the
E06 0240 Corp of Army Engineers dammed the Red River. In 1959, according
E06 0250 to the Engineers, Lake Texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial
E06 0260 lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1,000,000
E06 0270 persons.   Where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been
E06 0280 created by bringing bodies of water to the people, means have been found
E06 0290 to take the people and their boats to the water. Providing these
E06 0300 means are about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1,800,000
E06 0310 boat trailers now in use. It is a simple task to haul a boat fifty
E06 0320 or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new, light, strong,
E06 0330 easy-to-operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any
E06 0340 kind of small boat and retail from $100 to $2,000. The sight of
E06 0350 sleek
E06 0360 inboards, outboards, and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways
E06 0370 many miles from any water is commonplace.   Boatmen lucky enough
E06 0380 to have facilities for year 'round anchorage for their craft,
E06 0390 will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car,
E06 0391 driving to the water,
E06 0400 and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to
E06 0410 the boat. Today, the boat, on its trailer, is brought to the gear and
E06 0420 loaded at the door. Arriving at the waterside, the boat is launched,
E06 0430 the family taken aboard and, that easily, another day afloat is begun.
E06 0440    And trailers for boats are not what they started out to be
E06 0450 ten years ago. This year, Americans will discover previously unheard
E06 0460 of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred
E06 0470 of our nation's national, regional and local boat shows. The boats
E06 0480 of America's trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddled on clouds as
E06 0490 they are hauled to new horizons.   The variety of craft on the
E06 0500 country's waters today is overwhelming. They range from an eight-foot
E06 0510 pram, which you can build yourself for less than $50, to auxiliary
E06 0520 sailboats which can cost over $100,000. Boat prices vary according to
E06 0530 the buyer's desires or needs. In this respect, boats can be compared
E06 0540 with houses. There is no limit to what you can spend, yet it is easily
E06 0550 possible to keep within a set budget. There is no question as to
E06 0560 just what is available. You name it, our industry is producing it, and
E06 0570 it probably is made in different models.   There are canoes ideal
E06 0580 for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips. There are
E06 0590 houseboats which are literally homes afloat, accommodating whole families
E06 0600 in comfort and convenience. You can cross an ocean in a fully equipped
E06 0610 craft, sail, power, or both, or laze away a fine day in a small
E06 0620 dinghy on a local pond.   You may have your boat of wood, canvas,
E06 0630 plywood, plastic, or metal. You may order utility models, inboard or
E06 0640 outboard, with or without toilets, galleys, and bunks. You may dress
E06 0650 it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose.
E06 0660    Designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers
E06 0670 who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly Pasadena
E06 0680 lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once-a-month
E06 0690 ride around the block, to the sportiest boatman who insists on all
E06 0700 the dash, color, flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat.
E06 0710 You pay your money and you take your choice.   American technology
E06 0720 in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful
E06 0730 interest in American boating. I wonder if anyone ever bothered
E06 0740 to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors, Americans
E06 0760 excel over any country in the world in the long run.   Russia,
E06 0770 whose technology is not quite primitive, is still in the dark ages
E06 0780 when it comes to improving the outboard motor, for instance.   Now
E06 0790 here is truly a marvel. The outboard engine of today has a phenomenal
E06 0800 range of one to 80 horsepower, unheard of a few years ago for a two
E06 0810 cycle engine in quantity production. These engines can be removed
E06 0820 from a boat with relative ease, wherein lies their greatest advantage.
E06 0830 Their cost is not beyond the hopes of the American pocketbook, the
E06 0840 range being about $150 to $1,000, depending on size.   Great
E06 0850 thought
E06 0860 has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population
E06 0870 of the country; and to making the owning of a boat simpler. There
E06 0880 was a time when, if a man wanted to purchase a boat, it was necessary
E06 0890 for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he
E06 0900 could touch the tiller or wheel. Having a boat financed through a local
E06 0910 bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended.
E06 0920 Marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer
E06 0930 areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later.
E06 0940    Terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down
E06 0950 payments run about the same as for automobiles. Of course, individual
E06 0960 financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaser's earning
E06 0970 power, credit rating and local bank policy.   Outboard motors,
E06 0980 insurance, and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as
E06 0990 boats. Terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those
E06 1000 for home appliances.   When the automobile was in its embryonic
E06 1010 stage, such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit
E06 1020 understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about
E06 1030 the only rule governing where, when and how fast a car could go. When
E06 1040 air travel was in its infancy, the sky was considered big enough and
E06 1050 high enough for all. Man had enough to worry about managing to get
E06 1060 up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft. It was
E06 1070 much the same with pleasure boating at first. Come one, come all, the
E06 1080 water's fine!   As the ungoverned days of the automobile
E06 1090 and the airplane are long since relegated to the past, so is the carefree
E06 1100 attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do; must and should
E06 1110 do. However, there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating.
E06 1120    Laws on boating vary according to the state in which the
E06 1130 craft is to be used and according to its horsepower. What may be acceptable
E06 1140 in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line.
E06 1150 The main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according
E06 1160 to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally
E06 1170 used. If your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure
E06 1180 boats, you must apply for a number from the U&S& Coast Guard for
E06 1190 any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower
E06 1200 before it can be used on Federal waterways.   State numbering
E06 1210 laws differ from each other in many ways. Fees are not the
E06 1220 same
E06 1230 and some states do not require certain craft, such as sailboats with
E06 1240 no power, to be registered at all. Many states have laws regulating
E06 1250 the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age
E06 1260 of motor boat operators.   Generally, states reserve for communities
E06 1270 the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities.
E06 1280 It is always wise to consult your marine dealer, local yacht
E06 1290 or boat club secretary, or local law enforcement officers if you are
E06 1300 not positive what the regulations are. Ignorance of the law is no better
E06 1310 excuse on the water than it is on land; lack of ability and common
E06 1320 sense can lead to just as much tragedy.   Hand in hand with
E06 1330 the legislative program is the industry's self originated and directed
E06 1340 safety program. Foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the
E06 1350 rapid growth of the sport, the industry has been supporting an intense,
E06 1360 coordinated educational program with great success since 1947.
E06 1370    A primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the
E06 1380 enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers. The industry
E06 1390 has been its own watch dog. With U&S& Coast Guard cooperation,
E06 1400 the American Boat and Yacht Council was formed to develop recommended
E06 1410 practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference
E06 1420 to safety.   Industry interest in safety goes even farther.
E06 1430 In 1959, the Yacht Safety Bureau was reorganized by the National
E06 1440 Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers and a group of insurance
E06 1450 underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service
E06 1460 for boats and their equipment. A new waterfront site for the bureau
E06 1470 is now being built at Atlantic City, New Jersey, to provide the
E06 1480 most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the
E06 1490 sport safe.   In addition to these activities, the ~NAEBM,
E06 1500 with headquarters at 420 lexington Avenue, New York City, as well
E06 1510 as other associations and individual manufacturers, provide and distribute
E06 1520 films, booklets, and public services in regard to proper boat handling
E06 1530 and safety afloat.   It is important to note the work of
E06 1540 the United States Power Squadrons and the U&S& Coast Guard
E06 1550 Auxiliary. Each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in
E06 1560 seamanship piloting and small boat handling. These are not governmentally
E06 1580 subsidized organizations. This year, over 100,000 persons will
E06 1590 receive this free instruction.   As America on wheels was responsible
E06 1600 for an industry of motor courts, motels, and drive-in establishments
E06 1610 where you can dine, see a movie, shop, or make a bank deposit,
E06 1620 the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries
E06 1630 designed especially to accommodate them. Instead of motels, for
E06 1640 the boatman there are marinas.   The word marina was coined by
E06 1650 ~NAEBM originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational
E06 1660 boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative
E06 1670 comfort. Currently, marina is used to indicate a municipal or
E06 1680 commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and findsome
E06 1690 or all of the following available: gasoline, fresh water, electricity,
E06 1700 telephone service, ice, repair facilities, restaurants, sleeping
E06 1710 accommodations, a general store, and a grocery store.   Yachtel,
E06 1720 a relatively new word, indicates a waterfront type of hotel where
E06 1730 a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises
E06 1740 as well as other services. Boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel.
E06 1750 It indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically
E06 1760 to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as
E06 1770 outboards. Regardless of nomenclature, yachtels and boatels are marinas.
E06 1780    Boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities
E06 1790 may rightfully be called marinas.   A recent survey disclosed there
E06 1800 are about 4,000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and
E06 1810 boatyards in the United States, the majority of which are equipped
E06 1820 to handle outboard boats.
E07 0010 THE design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical
E07 0020 puzzle, but once understood, the principles can be applied to
E07 0030 any track and signal arrangement. In the frame are two sets of bars
E07 0040 which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous
E07 0050 moves. The main set of bars are the "tappets" and one tappet
E07 0060 is connected to each lever. If the lever is pulled to clear a signal
E07 0070 or move a switch, the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at
E07 0080 the same time.   Close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking
E07 0090 bars. These can also move a short distance but at right angles
E07 0100 to the tappets. The number of locking bars required depends on how many
E07 0110 false moves must be prevented.   In the sides of the tappets
E07 0120 are notches with sloping sides, and connection between the tappets and
E07 0130 locking bars consist of cams called "dogs". Two or more dogs are
E07 0140 mounted on each locking bar. These slide into and out of the notches
E07 0150 in the tappets as the tappets are moved, locking and unlocking them.
E07 0160    Here's how the scheme works: Suppose the operator pulls
E07 0170 the lever to clear a particular signal. This also pulls the tappet connected
E07 0180 to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches
E07 0190 to the side, thus moving one or more locking bars. The dogs on the
E07 0200 other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other
E07 0210 tappets. By this scheme, pulling one signal to clear locks all the
E07 0220 other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal
E07 0230 is again restored to normal.   Interlocking signals are normally
E07 0240 at stop or "red" position, and a lever must be pulled to "clear"
E07 0250 the signal. This is not necessarily to green, however, for in
E07 0260 some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it
E07 0270 into the "plant".   There are other basic rules. A turnout
E07 0280 may have two levers, one to actually move the switch points, the other
E07 0290 to lock the points. A signal cannot be cleared until all the related
E07 0300 turnouts are properly thrown <and> locked. Such locks are nearly
E07 0310 always used where the switch points "face" oncoming traffic. The
E07 0320 lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that
E07 0330 a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point. If the points aren't
E07 0340 thrown all the way, the turnout cannot be locked, and in turn,
E07 0350 the signal cannot be cleared. Generally, these locks on turnouts are
E07 0360 called "facing point locks".   Figs& 1-6 show typical arrangements
E07 0370 of track and signals. Each diagram is accompanied by a "dog
E07 0380 chart", a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular
E07 0390 lever will lock if pulled. The lines connecting the wedge-shaped
E07 0400 dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars.
E07 0410    By studying the track-signal diagrams you'll note several
E07 0420 other details. Derails- mechanical track devices that actually guide
E07 0430 the wheels off the rails if a train passes a "stop" signal- are
E07 0440 used in many instances. "Home" signals have two blades. The blacked-in
E07 0450 blades indicate a fixed aspect- the blade does not move. As
E07 0460 an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal
E07 0470 is seen in advance when he passes the "distant" signal located
E07 0480 beyond the limits of the interlocking plant. In some low-speed situations,
E07 0490 the distant signal is fixed at caution. In other instances where
E07 0500 there is no automatic block signaling, the distant has only green
E07 0510 and yellow aspects.   So much for the prototype.   The interlocking
E07 0520 frame we built at the MODEL RAILROADER workshop and then
E07 0530 installed on Paul Larson's railroad follows the Fig& 1 scheme
E07 0540 and is shown beginning in Fig& 7, page 65, and in the photos. Here's
E07 0550 how it can be built. #FRAME# The sizes of pieces needed
E07 0560 for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within Fig& 7, most
E07 0570 of the bars being 1/8'' brass in 1/4'' and 1/2'' widths.
E07 0580 You may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers
E07 0590 and locks as you wish. Our instructions assume you are building
E07 0600 this particular frame, which is for a junction.   When cutting
E07 0610 the pieces, dress the ends smooth, and square with a smooth file or sanding
E07 0620 disk. Start with the right-hand piece "~B", **f, soldering
E07 0630 it to the lower piece "~A" of the same material but 12''
E07 0640 long. Let exactly 1'' of "~A" extend beyond "~B" and
E07 0650 use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees.   Now
E07 0660 lay 12 pieces of **f cut 5-3/4'' long side by side but separated
E07 0670 by 12 pieces of the same material 1/2'' sq&. This gives you the
E07 0680 spacing for locating the left-hand piece "~B". Compress the assembly
E07 0690 when you make the mark to show the location for "~B". Solder
E07 0700 this second "~B" to "~A" at right angles. There
E07 0710 should be 10'' between the two parallel members and each should be
E07 0720 1'' from an end of the long piece.   Cap this assembly (with
E07 0730 spacing bars in place) with a **f bar. Tack-solder all the 1/2''
E07 0740 sq& pieces to the 10'' and 12'' members. These will be drilled
E07 0750 and tapped later on.   Now cut five **f locking bar spacers
E07 0760 (which run horizontally). Position these using six intermediate temporary
E07 0770 **f spacers and locate the upper 12'' bar "~A". Solder
E07 0780 it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame. Now place 12 pieces
E07 0790 1/2'' sq& on this edge as we did before and space them with
E07 0800 the 5-3/4'' long "tappets", as they are called. Cap with a **f
E07 0810 bar and tack-solder in place. Cap the locking bar spacers with two
E07 0820 **f directly under the first two "~B" pieces. Remove all the
E07 0830 loose spacing bars.   Mark and center-punch all the holes required
E07 0840 for screws to hold this assembly together. See Fig& 7. Placement
E07 0850 of these holes is not critical, but they should be located so that
E07 0860 the centers are about 1/8'' from any edge. Drill all No& 50 and
E07 0870 counter-drill all except the "~A" pieces size 43. Tap the "~A"
E07 0880 pieces 2-56.   Now unsolder and disassemble the frame
E07 0890 except for the two 12'' and the first two 3-3/4'' bars ("~A"
E07 0900 and "~B" pieces), which are soldered together. Either lay
E07 0910 the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters
E07 0920 so they may be replaced in their proper positions. Dress all surfaces
E07 0930 with a file, cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs.
E07 0940    Drill 20 No& 47 holes in the upper piece "~A" as shown in
E07 0950 Fig& 7. Tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical contact later
E07 0960 on. Note 6 and 8 lock levers don't require holes for contacts.
E07 0970    Now reassemble the frame, using **f roundhead steel screws and nuts.
E07 0980 Put the 12 tappets and some **f locking bar spacers in the frame to
E07 0990 help align all the components before you tighten the screws. Be sure
E07 1000 the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 1/2'' sq& spacer. As
E07 1010 an anchor for the spring lock, insert a **f bar in the lower left corner
E07 1020 of the frame as shown in Fig& 7. Drill a No& 43 hole through
E07 1030 the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw. Drill two No& 50
E07 1040 holes, one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly
E07 1050 above it, and tap 2-56. Number all the tappet bars before removing them
E07 1060 so they can be replaced in the same slots. Remove all other loose
E07 1070 pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth. Cut five pieces
E07 1080 of **f brass bar stock 3-3/4'' long. These are supporting members
E07 1090 for the short locking bars. Locate their positions in Fig& 7 and
E07 1100 drill No& 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame. Cut off
E07 1110 excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut. Drill
E07 1120 four No& 19 and four No& 28 holes in the 12'' long "~A"
E07 1130 pieces. Locate the position from Fig& 7. #TAPPETS AND LOCKING
E07 1140 BARS# Draw-file No& 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective
E07 1150 slot and square the ends. Break the end corners with a slight 45 degree
E07 1160 chamfer. Drill a No& 50 hole 1-1/4'' from one end and tap
E07 1170 2-56. (See Fig& 7.) Put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole, cut
E07 1180 off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar.
E07 1190 To find the other stop screw position, insert the tappet into the frame
E07 1200 and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge. Scribe a line
E07 1210 across the bar on the other end of the tappet, 1/4'' plus half the
E07 1220 diameter of the 2-56 screw head (about 5/64'') away from the frame
E07 1230 edge. Total distance is about 21/64''. Tend to make this dimension
E07 1240 slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly
E07 1250 1/4'' tappet movement. Drill a No& 50 hole, tap 2-56 and insert
E07 1260 a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end. Drill a No&
E07 1270 47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in
E07 1275 Figs&
E07 1280 7 and 8. Repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet
E07 1290 bars.   To each tappet except 6 and 8, solder a **f piece of
E07 1300 brass and file to the tapered shape shown in Figs& 6 and 8. These
E07 1310 will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts.   Fitting
E07 1320 the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job
E07 1330 since stop screws, tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced
E07 1340 many times. As the work progresses the frame and moving parts become
E07 1350 a sort of Chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before
E07 1360 the part you are working on is accessible. A little extra work
E07 1370 here will pay off with a smooth, snug-fitting machine when you are finished.
E07 1380 Each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work
E07 1390 progresses to insure snug fitting.   The order of fitting is not
E07 1400 too important. However, we started with the first row of bars and worked
E07 1410 our way back. Since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs
E07 1420 and notches is used throughout, we will only describe the construction
E07 1430 of one locking bar. Figs& 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions.
E07 1440 All the bars are cut from **f brass. The lengths of each piece are
E07 1450 listed at the bottom of Fig& 7. Bar "~C" is 2-3/4'' long.
E07 1460 Draw-file the edges, square up the ends and put a slight chamfer
E07 1470 on the edges so they will not snag in the frame.   Fig& 8 gives
E07 1480 the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes. Center-punch and drill
E07 1490 the No& 31 hole 7/16'' from one end of the bar. Chuck a length
E07 1500 of 1/8'' dia& drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning
E07 1510 device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file
E07 1520 a slight taper 1/8'' long. Cut the piece about 9/32'' or 5/16''
E07 1530 long and drive it into the No& 31 hole drilled in the locking
E07 1540 bar. File the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1/8''
E07 1550 above the bar. This dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3.
E07 1560    Place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3.
E07 1570 Scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of
E07 1580 tappet 3, parallel to piece "~A". See the drawings for the shape
E07 1590 of the notch. Scribe ~V-shaped lines on the bar and rough out
E07 1600 with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool. We used
E07 1610 the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about .020'' thick and
E07 1620 1'' dia& fitted on a 1/8'' dia& mandrel. Such disks are
E07 1630 very handy for cutting and shaping small parts. File to a smooth finish.
E07 1640 A Barrette Swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular
E07 1650 shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without
E07 1660 marring an adjoining one. Endeavor to get the notches as much alike
E07 1670 as possible. The notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel
E07 1680 dog will slide easily over it. Assemble the parts in the frame and
E07 1690 test the sliding action of the mating pieces. All matching surfaces
E07 1700 should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis.
E07 1710 Chuck a 2'' or 3'' piece of 1/8'' dia& drill rod in a
E07 1720 drill press or
E07 1730 electric hand tool. Fashion a sharp scribing point about 3/64''
E07 1740 long on one end, using Swiss pattern files. This tool can also be
E07 1750 made with a lathe.
E08 0010    Scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on
E08 0020 mathematics. Without math the men who are continually seeking the causes
E08 0030 of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round
E08 0040 would not have any means of analyzing, standardizing, and communicating
E08 0050 the things they discover and learn. Math and the formulas that
E08 0060 allow it to be applied to different problems are, therefore, essential
E08 0070 to any scientific endeavor.   Hot rodding is a science. It's
E08 0080 not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate
E08 0090 on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit
E08 0100 but it is, nevertheless, a science. But because science is based on mathematics
E08 0110 doesn't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician.
E08 0120 A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years
E08 0130 without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems;
E08 0140 however, he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and
E08 0150 the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few
E08 0160 formulas that apply to rodding.   A mathematical formula is nothing
E08 0170 more than a pattern for solving a specific problem. It places the
E08 0180 various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation
E08 0190 to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can
E08 0200 be computed.   The first step in using a formula is to insert the
E08 0210 numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions
E08 0220 in the formula. This changes the formula to an "equation". The
E08 0230 equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem.
E08 0240    Equations for rodding formulas are not complicated. They involve
E08 0250 only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic
E08 0260 classes. However, it is essential that the various mathematical symbols
E08 0270 used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes
E08 0280 can be done properly and in their correct order. They indicate
E08 0290 simple division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition.   The
E08 0300 symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers
E08 0310 placed one above the other. The lower number is always divided into the
E08 0320 upper number: **f   The symbol for multiplication is "~@".
E08 0340 It is used to separate two or more numbers in a row. For example:
E08 0350 **f Numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any
E08 0360 order. The result will be the same regardless of the order used.
E08 0370    The symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign. This is
E08 0380 nothing more than a dash. It separates two or more numbers. The number
E08 0390 on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on
E08 0400 the left of the symbol. For example: **f When more than two figures
E08 0410 are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried
E08 0420 out from the left to right if the result is to be correct. For example,
E08 0430 for the problem **f, 10 from 25 equals 15, then 6 from 15 equals
E08 0440 9.   Addition is indicated by the ~+ symbol. The symbol is
E08 0450 used to separate two or more numbers. For example: **f Numbers separated
E08 0460 by addition symbols may be placed in any order.   When solving
E08 0470 an equation that involves division as well as other steps, do all
E08 0480 the division steps first
E08 0490 to reduce those parts of the equation to their
E08 0500 numerical value. Multiplication, subtraction, and addition can then
E08 0510 be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left
E08 0520 end of the equation and working toward the right. Completing the
E08 0530 division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication,
E08 0540 subtraction, or addition steps: **f This would be reduced
E08 0550 by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12. This part
E08 0560 of the equation would then become 4.   For use in formulas, fractions
E08 0570 should be converted to their decimal equivalents. The easiest
E08 0580 way to do this is with a conversion chart. Charts for this purpose
E08 0590 are available from many sources. They are included in all types of mathematical
E08 0600 handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision
E08 0610 measuring instruments.   The various mathematical processes can
E08 0620 be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places.
E08 0630 Shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental
E08 0640 effect on the accuracy of the final result.   Some formulas
E08 0650 contain "constants". A constant is a number that remains the same
E08 0660 regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant
E08 0670 equation. It is a number without which the equation cannot be solved
E08 0680 correctly.   Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport.
E08 0690 The answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases
E08 0695 and,
E08 0700 quite often, are necessary for completing entry blanks for different
E08 0710 events. When it is needed, one formula is as important as another.
E08 0720 However, some formulas are used more than others. We'll take
E08 0730 them in the general order of their popularity. #ENGINE DISPLACEMENT#
E08 0740 A rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine.
E08 0750 Displacement is sometimes referred to as "swept volume". Most
E08 0760 entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information
E08 0770 because of class restrictions. It is good to be able to compute
E08 0780 displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking
E08 0790 can be computed.   Factors involved in the displacement formula
E08 0800 are the bore diameter of the engine's cylinders, the length of the
E08 0810 piston stroke, the number of cylinders in the engine, and a constant.
E08 0820 The constant is .7854, which is one-quarter of 3.1416, another constant
E08 0830 known as "pi". Pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions
E08 0840 of circles.   Actually, the engine displacement formula is
E08 0850 the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type
E08 0860 with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the
E08 0870 engine. The cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and
E08 0880 then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying
E08 0890 the area by the stroke length, which is the equivalent of the length
E08 0900 of the cylinders. Multiplying the result by the number of cylinders
E08 0910 in the engine gives the engine's total displacement.   The formula
E08 0920 is: **f. Dimensions in inches, and fractions of inches will give
E08 0930 the displacement in cubic inches. Dimensions in centimeters and fractions
E08 0940 of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters
E08 0950 (~cc). One inch equals 2.54 centimeters: one cubic inch equals 16.38
E08 0960 cubic centimeters.   For example, let's consider a standard
E08 0970 283 cubic inch Chevy ~V8. These engines have a cylinder diameter
E08 0980 of 3-7/8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches. The formula, with
E08 0990 the fractions converted to decimals, becomes **f.   To arrive
E08 1000 at the answer, multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of
E08 1010 the group and working to the right. The different steps will look like
E08 1020 this: **f #COMPRESSION RATIO# A cylinder's compression ratio
E08 1030 is computed by comparing the cylinder's volume, or its displacement,
E08 1040 with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber.
E08 1050 Cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber
E08 1060 volume must be measured with a liquid.   Cylinder volume is
E08 1070 determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula:
E08 1080 **f.   To measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers
E08 1090 in the cylinder head, install the valves and spark plug in the chamber
E08 1100 and support the head so that its gasket surface is level. Then pour
E08 1110 water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill
E08 1120 the chamber to its gasket surface. Do not overfill the chamber. This
E08 1130 is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension.
E08 1140 Such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface
E08 1150 around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber.
E08 1160    The amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting
E08 1170 the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from
E08 1180 the original quantity. Most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters
E08 1190 (~cc), making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches.
E08 1200 However, the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic
E08 1210 centimeters. The compression ratio arrived at with the formula will
E08 1220 be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are
E08 1230 used. The only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be
E08 1240 quoted in the same terms.   The volume of the cylinder opening
E08 1250 in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square
E08 1260 inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of an inch. Sometimes
E08 1270 it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening
E08 1280 but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy
E08 1290 that it won't affect the final computation. The volume of the opening
E08 1300 is added to the combustion chamber volume.   Another thing
E08 1310 that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between
E08 1320 the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston
E08 1330 is in top dead center position. Compute this volume by measuring
E08 1340 the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately
E08 1350 as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring
E08 1360 device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth. The
E08 1370 formula for this step is: **f This volume is added to the total volume
E08 1380 of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening. The total of
E08 1390 these three volumes is the "final combustion chamber volume".
E08 1400    After the factors just described have been computed, they are applied
E08 1410 to the following formula: **f   For an example let's dream
E08 1420 up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic
E08 1430 inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches. Applying these figures
E08 1440 to the formula we get the equation: **f The compression ratio is
E08 1450 10 to 1.   This method of computing compression ratio cannot be
E08 1460 used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly
E08 1470 shaped heads. Any irregularity on the piston heads will make
E08 1480 it impossible, with normal means, to determine the final combustion
E08 1490 chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot
E08 1500 be readily computed. The only way to determine the final combustion
E08 1510 chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid
E08 1520 while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston
E08 1530 is in top dead center position. #GEAR RATIO- SPEED RELATIONSHIPS#
E08 1540 There are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships
E08 1550 of car speed, engine speed, rear axle gear ratio, and rear tire
E08 1560 size. By using the appropriate version any one of these factors can
E08 1570 be determined for any combination of the other three.   To simplify
E08 1580 the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of
E08 1590 the factors. These are   ~MPH for Car speed   ~RPM
E08 1600 for Engine crankshaft speed   ~R for Rear axle gear ratio
E08 1610    ~W for Tire size   Tire size can be determined in
E08 1620 several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is
E08 1630 by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly. This
E08 1640 is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire
E08 1650 is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft. A tire must be inflated
E08 1660 to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to
E08 1670 its operating weight when this measurement is made. The measurement
E08 1680 must be in inches. Any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement
E08 1690 must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics.
E08 1700 When tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used
E08 1710 in the formula.   To determine car speed for a given combination
E08 1720 of engine speed, gear ratio, and tire size, the formula is: **f
E08 1730 For an engine speed of 5000 ~rpm, a gear ratio of 4.00 to 1, and a
E08 1740 tire radius of 13 inches, the equation would look like this: **f
E08 1750    To determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three
E08 1760 factors the formula is: **f Using the same figures as for the
E08 1770 previous example, the equation becomes: **f   To determine the
E08 1780 rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors, the
E08 1790 formula is: **f Using the figures from the previous examples, the
E08 1800 equation becomes: **f
E09 0010 #ORLANDO, FLA&, FEB& 2#- The best 2-year-old pacing mile up
E09 0020 to date at Ben White Raceway has been that of Mary Liner (Mainliner-Highland
E09 0030 Ellen), a member of the Dick Williams stable, who was
E09 0040 clocked 2:25. She is owned by Ralph H& Kroening, Milwaukee,
E09 0050 Wis&, who, according to the railbirds, can feel justly proud of her.
E09 0060    Other good miles have been by Debonnie (Dale Frost-Debby
E09 0070 Hanover) and Prompt Time (Adios-On Time) in 2:28-:36;
E09 0080 Kimberly Gal (Galophone-Kimberly Hanover) 2:26.2; Laguerre
E09 0081 Hanover
E09 0090 (Tar Heel- Lotus Hanover) and Monel (Tar Heel-Miracle Byrd)
E09 0100 in 2:34~h. Laguerre Hanover is outstanding in type and conformation-
E09 0110 good body, plenty of heart girth, stands straight on his legs
E09 0120 on excellent feet- and has the smoothest gait. This colt is behind
E09 0130 most of the other 2-year-olds in the Simpson stable but can show
E09 0140 about as much pace as any of them. Monel shows improvement with each
E09 0150 work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her
E09 0160 share of races.   Stardel (Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover),
E09 0170 2:34~h, looks quite promising. Fury Hanover (Hoot Mon-Fay),
E09 0180 Caper (Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover) and Isaac (Hoot Mon-Goddess
E09 0190 Hanover) have been working together but have not equalled their best
E09 0200 work done some weeks ago. Fury and Caper worked in 2:35~h and did
E09 0210 it with ease. They are two good colts of different type. Fury is
E09 0220 upstanding and on the rangy side, and Caper is more the compact type.
E09 0230 I have never seen Caper off his feet- he seems to know nothing but
E09 0240 'trot' and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so. Fury
E09 0250 has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect, with his
E09 0260 impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground.
E09 0270    Trackdown (Torrid-Mighty Lady) has worked a mile in 2:33.3~h.
E09 0280 It took this colt several weeks to strike a pace. Then, after
E09 0290 emasculation, he was eased up for a couple of weeks. He has thrived
E09 0300 on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race
E09 0310 horse.   Thor Hanover (Adios-Trustful Hanover) is a wonderful
E09 0320 looking prospect and another good individual, with solid, rugged conformation,
E09 0330 good, flat bone and excellent feet. This colt arrived at
E09 0340 the Raceway early last November, and immediately was put into harness
E09 0350 and line-driven for a few days, and then put to cart and broken in
E09 0360 very nicely, knowing nothing but trot. He appeared in the hopples about
E09 0370 November 14, was treated for worms on the 18th, the latter date being
E09 0380 the first time he struck a real pace. On December 5 he paced a mile
E09 0390 in 2:55 on the twice-around, out in third position all the way.
E09 0400 This colt has done everything asked of him, and done it with ease. His
E09 0410 best mile to date is 2:32.2~h.   Gamecock (Tar Heel-Terka
E09 0420 Hanover) is another promising colt, and his best time is 2:32.2~h.
E09 0430 This is one of the best-tempered Tar Heels ever at the center.
E09 0440 The first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare;
E09 0450 the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff. The fourth time in
E09 0460 harness he walked off like a gentleman. Being blistered for curbs has
E09 0470 delayed his work somewhat. But up to date he has shown as much as any
E09 0480 in the big Simpson stable.   Hustler (Knight Dream-Torkin)
E09 0490 is a playful bay rascal of a colt, not the best gaited, but he surely
E09 0500 can pace and is right there with them, and sometimes leading them, in
E09 0510 the best miles. Torrid Freight (Torrid-Breeze On Hal) is a very
E09 0520 rugged, strong-made colt with a wonderful stride who has done with ease
E09 0530 everything asked of him. His best time is around 2:33.   Strongheart
E09 0540 (Adios-Direct Gal), a fair-looking sorrel colt, knows nothing
E09 0550 but pace and has been right there in the best miles. Torrid Adios
E09 0560 (Torrid-Adios Molly) is not so masculine as most of the colts,
E09 0570 but I like his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited pacers
E09 0580 on the grounds. Blistered for curbs and laid off three weeks, he is
E09 0590 coming along fine and looks like a pacer to me. First Flyer (Frisco
E09 0600 Flyer-Castle Light) looks like a splendid candidate for the Illinois
E09 0610 Stakes. His best time is 2:33.2~h.   The colts in Simpson's
E09 0620 stable have little if anything on the fillies, especially the
E09 0630 pacers. Justine Hanover (Sampson Hanover-Justitia Hanover) is
E09 0640 improving with each work-out and paced 2:32.4~h weeks ago.
E09 0650 Mrs& Freight (Knight Dream-Miss Reed) shows promise and does it
E09 0660 in good form, and her best time is about 2:35. Hoopla (Tar Heel-Holiday
E09 0670 Hanover), a filly that wanted to trot, knocked herself October
E09 0680 31 and November 1 fighting the hopples. She was then trained on
E09 0690 the trot until December 29, hitched to a breaking cart once around the
E09 0700 half-mile track and hoppled again. This time she submitted and in
E09 0710 a few days was going good. On January 11 she paced a mile in 2:43.1-:38~h;
E09 0720 on Jan& 18 2:37.3-:36.1~h; on Jan& 21, 2:36.
E09 0730 This filly is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters,
E09 0740 Valentine Day and Cerise- more scale and much better underpinning.
E09 0750 She is more like her full brother, Taraday Hanover, but
E09 0760 larger. Up to date she is a grand-looking filly.   Pete Dailey
E09 0770 has four promising 2-year-old pacers. Marquis Pick (Gene Abbe-Direct
E09 0780 Grattan) seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time.
E09 0790 He is a fine-looking colt with a good body, good set of legs and nice
E09 0800 way of going. His best mile to date is 2:28-:33. Majestic Pick
E09 0810 comes next, with a mile in 2:30-:33.2. This colt is another
E09 0820 fine-looking equine. Staley Hanover (Knight Dream-Sweetmite Hanover)
E09 0830 is a little on the small side but a very compact colt and looks
E09 0840 like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his
E09 0850 class. Best time to date is 2:34-:34. Step Aside (Direct Rhythm-Wily
E09 0860 Widow) has worked in 2:32 on the half-mile track and shows
E09 0870 promise.   Most of Billy Haughton's 2-year-olds have worked
E09 0880 from 2:40 to 2:35. Bonnie Wick (Gene Abbe-Scotch Mary) has
E09 0890 gone in 2:36~h; Hickory Ash (Titan Hanover-Misty Hanover)
E09 0900 in 2:35. The first time I saw the latter filly she trotted by me
E09 0910 and I noticed such a family resemblance that I said to myself, "that
E09 0920 must be Hickory Ash". She is a beautiful filly and likes to trot.
E09 0930 Hickory Hill (Star's Pride-Venus Hanover) has gone in 2:33~h;
E09 0940 Hickory Spark (Harlan-Hickory Tiny) 2:37~h; Buxton
E09 0950 Hanover (Tar Heel-Beryl Hanover) 2:35; Faber's Kathy
E09 0960 (Faber Hanover-Ceyway) 2:37~h; Honor Rodney (Rodney-Honor
E09 0970 Bright) around 2:40. The last-named is a fine-looking, large colt,
E09 0980 who has been unfortunate to be laid off for some time due to injuries.
E09 0990 He is going sound again now, and looks good.   Brief Candle
E09 1000 (Harlan-Marcia) has gone in 2:37~h; Lena Faber (Faber Hanover-Chalidale
E09 1010 Lena) 2:33~h; Martha Rodney (Rodney-Miss Martha
E09 1020 D&) 2:35~h; Checkit (Faber Hanover-Supermarket) 2:35~h;
E09 1030 Charm Rodney (Rodney-The Charmer) 2:37~h; Fair
E09 1040 Sail (Farvel-Topsy Herring) 2:36~h; Custom Maid (Knight Dream-Way
E09 1050 Dream) 2:34.2~h; Jacky Dares (Meadow Gene-Princess
E09 1060 Lorraine) 2:36~h; Good Flying (Good Time-Olivette Hanover)
E09 1070 2:36~h; Bordner Hanover (Tar Heel-Betty Mahone) 2:34;
E09 1080 Faber's Choice (Faber Hanover-Sally Joe Whippet) 2:36~h;
E09 1090 Invercalt (Florican-Inverness) 2:35~h; Duffy Dares
E09 1100 (Meadow Gene-Princess Mite) 2:36~h; Harold J& (Worthy Boy-Lady
E09 1110 Scotland) 2:36; Knightfall (Knight Dream-Miss Worthy
E09 1120 Grapes) 2:36~h; Next Knight (Knight Dream-Next Time) 2:36~h;
E09 1130 Trader Jet (Florican-My Precious) 2:37~h; Trader
E09 1140 Rich (Worthy Boy-Marquita Hanover) 2:37~h; Good Little
E09 1150 Girl (Good Time-Mynah Hanover) 2:36~h; Iosola Hanover (Kimberly
E09 1160 Kid-Isoletta Hanover) 2:36~h. The last-named is one
E09 1170 of the favorites in the stable, and the boys like her very much. I will
E09 1180 be able to tell you more about this string of equines in the near future.
E09 1190    I have just seen Debonnie and Prompt Time work a mile
E09 1200 in 2:34, last quarter in :35.3. In going away Debonnie got behind
E09 1210 several lengths, stalling at the start- she is a little fussy. They
E09 1220 left the three-quarters together and finished almost together. Prompt
E09 1230 Time shows class. This filly is another Adios that wants to trot,
E09 1240 and trot she did until forced to do otherwise. After well broken
E09 1250 and equipped with 12~oz shoes on behind, bare-footed in front, she
E09 1260 would trot a real storm with the master, Delvin, driving. Being placed
E09 1270 in the hopples she was completely baffled. She hesitated, she hopped,
E09 1280 she roll and rocked, skipped and jumped, but in some two weeks she
E09 1290 started to pace, From that time to this she has shown steady improvement
E09 1300 and now looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds.
E09 1310    Rain on Friday prevented many workouts, but there were a few miles
E09 1320 of note on Thursday.
E09 1330 Those responsible included Stardel Hanover
E09 1340 (Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover), 2:30-:34.3; Lorena Gallon
E09 1350 (Bill Gallon-Loren Hanover), 2:30-:34.3; Prudent Hanover
E09 1360 (Dean Hanover-Precious Hanover), 2:30.3-:35.3; Premium
E09 1370 Freight (Titan Hanover-Pebble Hanover), 2:30.3-:35.3; Laguerre
E09 1380 Hanover (Tar Heel-Lotus Hanover), 2:30.3-:36.1; Monel
E09 1390 (Tar Heel-Miracle Byrd), 2:30.3-:36.1; Fury Hanover (Hoot
E09 1400 Mon-Fay), 2:30.3-:36; Isaac (Hoot Mon-Goddess Hanover),
E09 1410 2:30.3-:36; Caper (Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover), 2:30.3-:36;
E09 1420 Lucky Freight (Knight Dream-Lusty Helen), 2:31.3-:35.3.
E09 1430    Sam Caton's Butterwyn (Scotch Victor-Butler Wyn),
E09 1440 a light bay filly, knows nothing but trot and has worked on the half-mile
E09 1450 in 2:30-:36. Riverboat (Dalzell-Cousin Rachel) has gone in
E09 1460 2:38~h. Sam is having his troubles with Layton Hanover (Dean
E09 1470 Hanover-Lucy Hanover), but hope to have him straightened out and going
E09 1480 before long.   Jimmy Jordon is high on Adios Scarlet (Adios-Rena
E09 1490 Grattan) and she sure looks good as she goes by. Her best
E09 1500 time to date is about 2:30~h. He also likes Hampton Hanover (Titan
E09 1510 Hanover-Bertie Hanover) 2:37~h. Cathy J& Hanover (Tar
E09 1520 Heel-Kaola Hanover), formerly called Karet Hanover, has been rather
E09 1530 a problem child, but it getting better all the while and can pace
E09 1540 a twice around in about 2:31. Armbro Comet (Nibble Hanover-Mauri
E09 1550 Hanover) has been in 2:38.   Flick Nipe's and Neil Engle's
E09 1560 Miss Phone (Galophone-Prissy Miss) is a fine-looking filly
E09 1570 with good disposition and good gait, and she has worked up to date in
E09 1571 2:46.
E09 1580 #DEL MAR, CALIF&, FEB& 3#- After 52 rainless
E09 1590 days, moisture finally came to Del Mar, resulting in but one workout
E09 1600 during the week for most of the horses, and leaving us with less than
E09 1610 half our total average rainfall during the season.   While 2-year-olds
E09 1620 are still gaining most of the attention at the track, green
E09 1630 horses are starting to go a bit, and Jimmy Cruise has several that
E09 1640 can really make it. Work-outs for the week are as follows: Plain
E09 1650 Scotch, 3 (by Scotch Victor), Demon Law, 3 (by Demon Hanover),
E09 1660 Coffee Royal, ~p (by Royal Blackstone) and Beauty Way, ~p, 3
E09 1670 (by Demon Hanover) in 2:25; Eddie Duke, ~p, 3 (by Duke of
E09 1680 Lullwater), Marilyn C&, ~p (by Sampson Hanover) and Chalidale
E09 1690 Barry, 5 (by King's Ransom) in 2:20; Tiger Hanover, ~p,
E09 1700 3 (by Adios) in 2:26; Sherwood Lass, 4 (by Victory Song) in 2:22;
E09 1710 and Dauntless, 3 (by Greentree Adios) in 2:32. For the
E09 1720 aged horses: Mr& Budlong, ~p, 2:00.2~h, Lottie Thomas, ~p,
E09 1730 2:04.2~h, Mighty Signal 2:03, Clever Braden, ~p, 2:01.1~h,
E09 1740 and Glow Star, ~p, 2:02.3 have been in 2:35; Miss
E09 1750 Demon Abbe, ~p, 1:59.3 has trotted in 2:26, and is expected to
E09 1760 race at this gait; Carter Creed, ~p, 3, 2:01.1, Great Lullwater
E09 1770 2:00.3, and Hi Jay, ~p, 2:05.1~h have been in 2:30;
E09 1780 Tanker T&, 3, 2:05.3 is now wearing hopples and has trained in
E09 1790 2:19; Stormy Dream, ~p, 2:01.3~h, Demon Abbe, ~p, 2:02,

E10 0010    The average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun (we
E10 0020 ran a survey to find out) but he's always on the lookout for new and
E10 0030 better arms. He's more than a reader of outdoor articles; he's
E10 0040 a real hunter and shooter, eager to improve his sport. Well, if you're
E10 0050 that kind of sportsman we're here to help you. You've probably
E10 0060 given a lot of Christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack,
E10 0070 but it's not easy to decide on a new one. You still have time to
E10 0080 drop a few hints about the gifts you'd appreciate most; the time
E10 0090 to decide on them is now. As a Christmas service, I've taken a close
E10 0100 look at this year's crop of new models. Here they are, with my
E10 0110 comments and judgments. Read on, take your pick- and start dropping
E10 0120 those hints.   First on my own list would be two arms- a rifle
E10 0130 and a handgun- that qualify as new in the strictest sense.
E10 0140 For me, a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn't constitute
E10 0150 a truly new design. Such modifications are all for the best but
E10 0160 it takes something as different as a Deerstalker or a Jet to change
E10 0170 arms-making concepts.   Bill Ruger's long-awaited Deerstalker
E10 0180 (under $110) is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the
E10 0190 modern theory of high-velocity fans; it's a short, light, quick-handling,
E10 0200 fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug
E10 0210 at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for
E10 0220 our most popular big game- whitetail.   Ruger reports that
E10 0230 on his recent African safari the little .44 Magnum cartridge was a
E10 0240 real work horse. Small antelope were generally grassed with one shot,
E10 0250 and the .44 Magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck, kob and wart hog with
E10 0260 deadly efficiency; these are fairly large, tough animals.
E10 0270 The deadliness of the .44 Magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to
E10 0280 me. At least five years ago, Tom Robinson of Marlin made up an over/under
E10 0290 double rifle for me in this caliber, using the now defunct Model
E10 0300 90 action in 20-gauge size. After figuring out how to regulate the
E10 0310 barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact, we fired this
E10 0320 little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in Marlin's underground
E10 0330 test gallery. We quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued Bill
E10 0340 Ruger in his first experiments: Three or four bullets would be
E10 0350 placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then, unaccountably,
E10 0360 one could stray far out of the group.   Ruger learned that this
E10 0370 was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting
E10 0380 the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet. The new, jacketed slug
E10 0390 in .44 Magnum corrected this. But even without jacketed bullets, I
E10 0400 had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt
E10 0410 that first year. Within half an hour I jumped a six-point buck that
E10 0420 hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket, and I caught him just behind
E10 0430 the left foreleg at 60 yards. He moved only about 30 feet after
E10 0440 the 240-grain slug hit him- and this was after the bullet had passed
E10 0450 through a sapling.   Three more deer have fallen to this same
E10 0460 gun, and all were one-shot kills. My double was made with standard-weight
E10 0470 revolver barrels (before cutting to revolver length), and although
E10 0480 it compares well in other respects, it's considerably heavier than
E10 0490 the Deerstalker, which only scales about 6-1/2 pounds.   If ever
E10 0500 a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter, this is it. The Deerstalker
E10 0510 points with the ease, speed and precision of a fine imported
E10 0520 double shotgun, and its trigger pull is light and sharp. The 240-grain
E10 0530 bullet leaves the muzzle at 1,850 ~fps, which gives it all the smash
E10 0540 needed at woods ranges. With five shots at the immediate command
E10 0550 of the hunter's trigger finger, the gun and load are a deadly combination.
E10 0560    The second really new development this year was a revolver
E10 0570 handling a different sort of varmint load- the .22 Remington Jet
E10 0580 Magnum Center Fire. At present it's available in one model, the
E10 0590 fine and familiar Smith + Wesson Magnum revolver (about $110),
E10 0600 long a top-quality handgun among target arms. The velocity of this .22-caliber,
E10 0610 40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2,460 ~fps, and it's
E10 0620 the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge, with a mid-range
E10 0630 rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range. This is a varmint load,
E10 0640 pure and simple; it's much too explosive for small edible game.
E10 0650 It can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry
E10 0660 of feathers.   The most intriguing aspect of the ~S+W Magnum
E10 0670 chambered for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard .22 rim-fires
E10 0680 by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers. You may therefore
E10 0690 convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm, although the difference
E10 0700 in the point of impact (Jet vs& rim-fire) can be somewhat disconcerting.
E10 0710 The accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine; I tested
E10 0720 it in my scoped ~S+W and it was good enough to allow me to hit a
E10 0730 chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I did my part by holding the handgun
E10 0740 steadily. #HUNTING RIFLES, '61# The fact that the Deerstalker
E10 0750 and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't
E10 0760 mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models, actions and calibers.
E10 0770 Aside from the Ruger carbine, a number of hunting rifles have been
E10 0780 introduced for the first time. Here are the brands (in alphabetical
E10 0790 order) and the new models.   Newcomers to the American hunter
E10 0800 are the Browning group of bolt-action, high-power rifles. They have
E10 0810 fine ~FN actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal
E10 0820 and the stock wood. Barrel weights vary sensibly with the various
E10 0830 calibers available, and these include the standard bores (about $165)
E10 0840 plus the Magnums (around $170); the latter include the .264, .300
E10 0850 ~H+H, .338, .375 and .458. Shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard
E10 0860 on all of the Magnums except the .264. Stock designs are excellent
E10 0870 for use with scopes.   Colt's center-fire 1961 rifles are
E10 0880 all made with Sako actions, regardless of caliber. The .222's have
E10 0890 the short action; the .243 and .308, the medium action, and the .270,
E10 0900 **f and the Magnums, the long action (about $135 for the Standard
E10 0910 Coltsman and $200 for the Custom version). Previously, ~FN actions
E10 0920 were used for the larger cartridges.   High standard has
E10 0930 introduced a .22 auto, the Sport-King, in two grades- field and special
E10 0940 (less than $45 and just over $45, respectively). It's a streamlined
E10 0950 rifle, fast and well-made.   Among .22 Magnum Rim-Fire
E10 0960 rifles, 1961's lone newcomer was the Kodiak Model 260 autoloader
E10 0970 (around $60). Previously known as Jefferson Arms, Kodiak has given
E10 0980 this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design, and the
E10 0990 260 is the first autoloader to handle .22 Magnum rim-fires.
E10 1000    Marlin
E10 1010 has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings. The
E10 1020 Model 99 (under $45) is a light-weight, streamlined .22 rim-fire auto
E10 1030 with a tubular magazine that holds 18 Long Rifles. It's extremely
E10 1040 accurate for an auto, and the test rifle I tried was completely
E10 1050 trouble-free in functioning. The 989 (about $40) is an even newer .22
E10 1060 auto, this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip.   Once again the
E10 1070 Mossberg Targo outfit has appeared, but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun
E10 1080 combination. The bore is unrifled but is provided with an
E10 1090 insert tube which is rifled and which, surprisingly, gives pretty fair
E10 1100 accuracy even though it's only 3-1/2 inches long. You can unscrew
E10 1110 this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with .22 shotshells-
E10 1120 to break the little Targo clay targets. A trap for throwing
E10 1130 these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can
E10 1140 throw his own targets. A spring trap for solid mounting and a regular
E10 1150 hand trap are also available. You can have your choice of a seven-shot
E10 1160 repeater, the ~340TR (about $40) or a single-shot, the ~320TR
E10 1170 ($10 less).   The Targo is a good outfit for fun shooting
E10 1180 or for economic wing-shooting practice, but it's tougher than it looks
E10 1190 to run up a score on the clay birds. They'll travel 50 feet or
E10 1200 more when thrown from the spring trap but it's almost impossible to
E10 1210 break one after it passes the 35-foot mark. The combination of thin
E10 1220 pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds,
E10 1230 right now!   Big Magnum calibers appeared in the Remington line
E10 1240 for 1961, with the addition of the .375 and .458 to the list of Model
E10 1250 725's. These are made on special order only, in Kodiak grade
E10 1260 (about $310), with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads;
E10 1270 they weigh around nine pounds.   A shortened version of the
E10 1280 highly regarded Remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961. This
E10 1290 carbine (under $140, about $15 more for a deluxe grade) has an 18-1/2-inch
E10 1300 barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year's
E10 1310 Model 760 pump with a short-barrel. This design is hard to beat
E10 1320 for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard. Presently,
E10 1330 the ~742C is available in **f.   The latest versions of the famous
E10 1340 Savage Model 99 are the 99 Featherweight (about $125) and the
E10 1350 99 Deluxe (under $135), which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger
E10 1360 design. The replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will
E10 1370 make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new
E10 1380 safety is easier and faster to operate. #BEGINNERS' GUNS, '61#
E10 1390 A fresh crop of beginners' guns showed up in 1961, and they're
E10 1400 good bets for your Christmas gift list if you're wondering what to
E10 1410 get for a youngster. The most unusual of them is the Ithaca 49 (about
E10 1420 $20, $5 for a saddle scabbard)- a lever-action single-shot patterned
E10 1430 after the famous Winchester lever-action and featuring the Western
E10 1440 look. Because of its traditional lines, it probably has more kid
E10 1450 appeal than any other model. The action is a drop-block, handling all
E10 1460 the standard .22 rim-fires.   Marlin's latest is also designed
E10 1470 for the beginning shooter, although it's a full-sized rifle with plenty
E10 1480 of barrel weight and ample stock. This is the Model 122 (about
E10 1490 $20); it's a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety-
E10 1500 i&e&, the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun
E10 1510 cocked for the next shot. Stock design is excellent, and this model
E10 1520 is a good first gun. Another boy's model is the .22 single-shot Remington
E10 1530 ~514C (around $20), which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a
E10 1540 short- 12-1/2-inch- stock; it's just right for a boy of 12-1/2.
E10 1550    A beginner's shotgun has also been introduced this year.
E10 1560 The single-barrel Stevens ~940Y (under $35) is made with a side lever
E10 1570 rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren't strong
E10 1580 enough to operate a top tang to open a gun- and the side lever does
E10 1590 indeed open very easily. This gun has a 12-1/2-inch stock and is
E10 1600 available in either 20 or .410 gauge. There's another addition to
E10 1610 the Stevens line, the pump-action Model 77 in .410 (under $75), which
E10 1620 you may or may not consider a kid's gun; many experienced hunters
E10 1630 like this gauge and type of scattergun too. #SHOTGUNS, '61# Although
E10 1640 there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year,
E10 1650 a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit
E10 1660 the market. For example, a Browning trap version of the Superposed
E10 1670 over/under, the Broadway (from $350 up, depending on grade), differs
E10 1680 from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore
E10 1690 end, a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast
E10 1700 sighting.   The Colt line now includes a new scattergun, the Standard
E10 1710 or Custom Pump Model (about $90 and $150, respectively) in
E10 1720 12, 16 and 20.   Firearms International has introduced another
E10 1730 import, this one from Finland. It's the Valmet (about $170), a 12-gauge
E10 1740 over/under very much like the old Remington 32- which was
E10 1745 so fine
E10 1750 a gun that today a used one still brings high prices.   High
E10 1760 Standard has also added two models to its line. The Supermatic Trophy
E10 1770 (prices begin at less than $135 and depend on grade and optional
E10 1780 features) is a 12-gauge auto. The Flite-King Trophy (beginning at
E10 1790 just over $85) is a pump gun in 12 or 16. Either model is a very good
E10 1800 dollar value.   Mossberg's latest contribution to the field is
E10 1810 the Model 500 (from $73.50); this is an improved version of the old
E10 1820 Model 200, a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun. See page 24 for a complete
E10 1830 report on it. #HANDGUNS, '61# Aside from the .22 Jet- which
E10 1840 I coupled with the Deerstalker carbine as one of the year's two
E10 1850 biggest developments- few significant innovations appeared among
E10 1860 1961's handguns.
E11 0010    LIVERY STABLE- J& VERNON, PROP"& Coaching had declined
E11 0020 considerably by 1905, but the sign was still there, near the old
E11 0030 Wells Fargo building in San Francisco, creaking in the fog as it
E11 0040 had for thirty years. John Vernon had had all the patronage he cared
E11 0050 for- he had prospered, but he could not retire from horsedom. Coaching
E11 0060 was in his blood. He had two interests in life: the pleasures
E11 0070 of the table and driving. Twice a week he drove his tallyho over the
E11 0080 Santa Cruz road, upland and through the redwood forest, with orchards
E11 0090 below him at one hand, and glimpses of the Pacific at the other. The
E11 0100 journey back he made along the coast road, traveling hell-for-leather,
E11 0110 every lantern of the tallyho ablaze.   The southward route
E11 0120 was the classic run in California, and the most fashionable. His patronage
E11 0130 on this stretch was made up largely of San Franciscans- regulars,
E11 0140 most of them, and trenchermen like himself. They did not complain
E11 0150 at the inhuman hour of starting (seven in the morning), nor of the
E11 0160 tariff, which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco.
E11 0170 Breakfast was at the Palace Hotel, luncheon was somewhere in the
E11 0180 mountain forest, and dinner was either at Boulder Creek or at Santa
E11 0190 Cruz.   Gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring, so
E11 0200 halts were contrived between meals. Then the Chinese hostler, who rode
E11 0210 with Vernon on the box, would break open a hamper and produce filets
E11 0220 of smoked bass or sturgeon, sandwiches, pickled eggs, and a rum sangaree
E11 0230 to be heated over a spirit lamp.   In spring and in autumn
E11 0240 the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend
E11 0250 of mine. They gathered roots, bulbs, odd ferns, leaves, and bits of
E11 0260 resin from the rare Santa Lucia fir, which exists only on a forty-five
E11 0270 mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains. In the Spanish
E11 0280 days Franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense.
E11 0290 It yields a fragrance as Orphic as that of the pastilles of Malabar.
E11 0300 Vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips, but he could
E11 0310 arrange no schedule with the cooks, and he was glad when the trips dropped
E11 0320 off, and the botanists began to motor out by themselves.
E11 0330 My friend often breakfasted with Vernon on the morning of the regular
E11 0340 tallyho run. This was an honor, like dining with a captain at his private
E11 0350 table. Vernon's office adjoined the stable, and the walls were
E11 0360 adorned with brightly colored lithographs, the folk art of the period.
E11 0370 They advertised harness polish, liniments, Ball's Rubber Boots,
E11 0380 Green River Whiskey, Hood's Sarsaparilla, patent medicines,
E11 0390 shoe blacking, and chewing tobacco.   The hostler would have the
E11 0400 table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove; then a porter
E11 0410 from Manning's Fish House would trot in with a tray on his head.
E11 0420 It was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster
E11 0430 salt roast and a mound of corn fritters. Vernon was consummately fond
E11 0440 of oysters, and Manning's had been famous for them since the Civil
E11 0450 War. Oyster salt roast- oysters on the half shell, cooked on a bed
E11 0460 of coarse salt that kept them hot when served- was a standby at Manning's.
E11 0470 Its early morning patrons were coachmen, who fortified themselves
E11 0480 for the day with that delicacy.   In the 1890's the
E11 0490 Palace Hotel began serving an oyster dish named after its manager, John
E11 0500 C& Kirkpatrick. This dish much resembles the oysters Rockefeller
E11 0510 made famous by Antoine's in New Orleans, though the Palace
E11 0520 chef announced it as a variant of Manning's roast oysters. (Gastronomes
E11 0530 have long argued about which came first, the Palace's or Antoine's.
E11 0540 Antoine's held as mandatory a splash of absinthe or Pernod
E11 0550 on the parsley or spinach which was used for the underbedding. The
E11 0560 Kirkpatrick version holds liqueur as optional.) Vernon, however,
E11 0570 held out for plain oyster roast, and plenty of it, unadorned by herbs
E11 0580 or any seasoning but salt, though he did fancy a bit of lemon.
E11 0590 After the meal, he and his guests went out to inspect the rig; this
E11 0600 was merely a ritual, to please all hands concerned. The tallyho had
E11 0610 cost Vernon $2,300. A replica of two coaches made in England for the
E11 0620 Belmont Club in the East, and matchless west of the Rockies, it
E11 0630 was the despair of whips on the Santa Cruz run. One could shave in
E11 0640 the reflection of its French-polished panels, and its axles were greased
E11 0650 like those of roulette wheels. The horses were groomed to a high
E11 0660 gloss; departing, they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw,
E11 0670 for they had been trained to drag at important funerals.   But
E11 0680 for the start of the Santa Cruz run, the whip fell. The clients boarded
E11 0690 the tallyho at the Palace promptly at seven. They had been fed
E11 0700 a hunting breakfast, so called because a kedgeree, the dish identified
E11 0710 with fox hunting, was on the bill. There are many ways of making a
E11 0720 kedgeree, every one of which is right. Here is an original kedgeree
E11 0730 recipe from the Family Club's kitchen: #CLUB KEDGEREE# Flake
E11 0740 (for three) a cupful of cold boiled haddock, mix with a cupful of cooked
E11 0750 rice, two minced hard-boiled eggs, some buttery white sauce done
E11 0760 with cream, cayenne, pepper, salt, a pinch of curry, a tablespoonful of
E11 0770 minced onion fried, and a bit of anchovy. Heat and serve hot on toast.
E11 0780 ## The omelet named for Ernest Arbogast, the Palace's chef,
E11 0790 was even more in demand. For decades it was the most popular dish
E11 0800 served in the Ladies' Grill at breakfast, and it is one of the few
E11 0810 old Palace dishes that still survive. Native California oysters,
E11 0820 salty and piquant, as coppery as Delawares and not much larger than a
E11 0830 five-cent piece, went into it. The original formula goes thus: #OMELET
E11 0840 ARBOGAST# Fry in butter a small minced onion, rub with a tablespoonful
E11 0850 of flour, add half a cup of cream, six beaten eggs, pepper,
E11 0860 celery salt, a teaspoonful of minced chives, a dash of cayenne, and a
E11 0870 pinch of nutmeg. A jigger of dry Sherry follows, and as the mixture
E11 0880 stiffens, in go a hundred of the little oysters.   Louis Sherry
E11 0890 once stayed a fortnight at the Palace, and he was so pleased with omelet
E11 0900 Arbogast that he introduced it at his restaurant in New York.
E11 0910 J& Pierpont Morgan had come in his private train to San Francisco,
E11 0920 to attend an Episcopal convention, and brought the restaurateur
E11 0930 with him. As things happened, Morgan was installed in the Nob Hill
E11 0940 residence of a magnate friend, whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved
E11 0950 talent. Sherry remained in his hotel suite, where he amused himself
E11 0960 as best he could. Twice he left everything to his entourage, and
E11 0970 fled to make the Santa Cruz tour under Vernon's guidance.
E11 0980    In the grand court of the Palace, notable for its tiers of Moorish
E11 0990 galleries that looked down on the maelstrom of vehicles below, Vernon's
E11 1000 station was at the entrance. It was a post of honor, held inviolate
E11 1010 for him; he had the primacy among the coachmen. Of majestic build,
E11 1020 rubicund and slash-mouthed, he resembled the late General Winfield
E11 1030 Scott, who was said to be the most imposing general of his century,
E11 1040 if not of all centuries. Vernon wore a gray tall hat, a gardenia,
E11 1050 and maroon Wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly.
E11 1060    Promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in
E11 1070 the tallyho. He had style: he held his reins in a loose bunch at the
E11 1080 third button of his checked Epsom surtout, and when the horses leaned
E11 1090 at a curve, as if bent by the force of a gale, he leaned with them.
E11 1100 They cantered down the peninsula, not slackening until the coach reached
E11 1110 Woodside where the Santa Cruz uplands begin.   The road
E11 1120 maps of the region have changed since 1905; inns have burned down, moved
E11 1130 elsewhere, or taken other names. Once on the road (and especially
E11 1140 if the passengers were all regulars and masculine), the schedule meant
E11 1150 nothing. An agreeable ease suffused Vernon and the passengers of
E11 1160 the tallyho, from which there issued clouds of smoke. Vernon would tilt
E11 1170 his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard,
E11 1180 indulging in a huge cigar. The horses moved at a clump; they were no
E11 1190 more on parade than was their driver; one fork of the road was as
E11 1200 good as another. The Santa Cruz mountains sprawl over three counties,
E11 1210 and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed
E11 1220 columns ripple streams of rain, even when heat bakes the Santa Clara
E11 1230 valley below at the left. The water splashes into shoulder-high tracts
E11 1240 of fernery. You arrive there in seersucker, and feel you were half-witted
E11 1250 not to bring a mackintosh.   Vernon kept an account book
E11 1260 with a list of all the establishments that he thought worthy of patronage.
E11 1270 A number of them must have fallen into disfavor; they were
E11 1280 struck out with remarks in red ink, denouncing both the cooks and the
E11 1290 management. He was copious in his praise of those that served food that
E11 1300 was good to eat. The horses seemed to know these by instinct, he used
E11 1310 to say: such places invariably had stables with superior feed bins.
E11 1320    There was Wright's, for one, lost amongst trees, its wide
E11 1330 verandas strewn with rockers. Many of its sojourners were devoted
E11 1340 to seclusion and quiet, and lived there to the end of their days. It
E11 1341 was
E11 1350 the haunt of writer Ambrose Bierce, who admired its redwoods. Acorns
E11 1360 from the great oaks fed the small black pigs (akin to Berkshires),
E11 1370 whose "carcass sweepstakes" were renowned. Their ham butts, cured
E11 1380 in oak-log smoke, were also esteemed when roasted or boiled, and served
E11 1390 with this original sauce: #WRIGHT'S DEVIL SAUCE# Put into
E11 1400 a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy, or of the boiled ham liquor,
E11 1410 with a half stick of butter, three teaspoonfuls of made mustard,
E11 1420 and two mashed garlic cloves. Contribute also an onion, a peeled tomato
E11 1430 and two pickled gherkins, and a mashed lime. After this has simmered
E11 1440 an hour, add two tablespoons each of Worcestershire, catsup, and
E11 1450 chutney, two pickled walnuts, and a pint of Sherry. Then simmer fifteen
E11 1460 minutes longer. ## Every winter a kegful of this sauce was made
E11 1470 and placed at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar, so
E11 1480 that when its turn came, it was properly mellowed.   Vineyards
E11 1490 and orchards also grew around Wright's, and deer were rather a nuisance;
E11 1500 they leaped six-foot fences with the agility of panthers. But
E11 1510 no one complained when they wound up, regardless of season, in venison
E11 1520 pies. No one complained of the white wine either: at this altitude
E11 1530 of two thousand feet, grapes acquire a dryness and the tang of gunflint.
E11 1540 (The Almaden vineyards have now climbed to this height.) Apple
E11 1550 trees grew there also. Though creeks in the Santa Cruz mountains
E11 1560 flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring, the apples that
E11 1570 grow there have a wintry crackle.   Dwellers thereabouts preferred
E11 1580 to get their apple pies at the local bakery, which had a brick oven
E11 1590 fired with redwood billets. The merit of the pie, Vernon believed,
E11 1600 was due more to its making than to the waning heat of the oven. The recipe,
E11 1610 which he got from the baker, and wrote down in his ledger, is basically
E11 1620 this: #WRIGHT'S APPLE PIE# Peel, core, and slice across
E11 1630 enough apples to make a dome in the pie tin, and set aside. In a
E11 1640 saucepan put sufficient water to cover them, an equal amount of sugar,
E11 1650 a sliced lemon, a tablespoonful of apricot preserve or jam, a pinch each
E11 1660 of clove and nutmeg, and a large bay leaf. Let this boil gently for
E11 1670 twenty minutes, then strain. Poach the apples in this syrup for twelve
E11 1680 minutes, drain them, and cool.   Set the apples in the pastry-lined
E11 1690 tin, spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter,
E11 1700 with as much brown sugar, a sprinkling of nutmeg, and a fresh bay leaf,
E11 1710 then lay on a cover of pastry, and gild it with beaten yolk of egg.
E12 0010    THOSE WHO have never traveled the width and length of this
E12 0020 land cannot conceive, on the basis of textbook description alone, the
E12 0030 overwhelming space and variety of this country held together under one
E12 0040 government. The miracle of democratic America comes home to one most
E12 0050 strongly only when one has seen the endless Great Plains of the
E12 0060 Midwest; the sky-reaching peaks of the Northwest mountains; the
E12 0070 smoke-filled, art-filled, drama-filled life of the great cities of the
E12 0080 East; the lush and historic charm of the South. Now, to add to the
E12 0090 already unbelievable extremes found in one nation, we have the two
E12 0100 new states of Hawaii and Alaska.   To hope to cover just one
E12 0110 region of this land and to enjoy all of its sights and events and, of
E12 0120 course, to bring back pictures of your experiences, requires advance planning.
E12 0130 For this reason, <U&S& Camera> has prepared this special
E12 0140 U&S&A& vacation feature. We divided the country into five
E12 0150 regions plus Hawaii and Alaska and in each is included a general
E12 0160 description of the area plus specific recommendations of places and events
E12 0170 to cover. Any special photographic requirements are also given.
E12 0180    Use this section to plan now to make the most of your vacation
E12 0190 in photogenic America. #THE NORTHEAST# BIRTHPLACE of the
E12 0200 nation, the Northeast offers historic battlefields; lovely old villages
E12 0210 and a rugged seashore among its many worthwhile sights. The rolling
E12 0220 farms of Maryland, the peerless metropolis of New York City,
E12 0230 the verdant mountains of Vermont can all be included in your Northeast
E12 0240 vacation.   By automobile from New York, for example, you can
E12 0250 take a one or two-day tour to Annapolis, Maryland to see the colonial
E12 0260 homes and the U&S& Naval Academy (where you can shoot the
E12 0270 dress parade on Wednesdays); to Washington, D&C&, for an eye-filling
E12 0280 tour of the city; or to Lancaster, Pa&, the center of
E12 0290 the Pennsylvania Dutch country; Philadelphia with its historic buildings
E12 0300 and nearby Valley Forge; to West Point, N&Y&, the
E12 0310 famous military academy in a beautiful setting on the Hudson River.
E12 0320    New England deserves as much of your vacation time as you can
E12 0330 afford with such areas as Cape Cod providing wonderful beaches, artists'
E12 0340 colonies and quaint townships. From here you can easily include
E12 0350 a side trip to the old whaling port of Nantucket, Massachusetts,
E12 0360 which looks just as it must have two centuries ago.   At Sturbridge
E12 0370 Village, Massachusetts, you'll find a completely-restored New
E12 0380 England town. North to Acadia National Park, Maine, with views
E12 0390 of a rockbound coast and dark, magnificent forests.   One of the
E12 0400 most exciting ways to end a Northeast vacation would be with a week
E12 0410 in New York City. Return through New England, stopping for a visit
E12 0420 to Lake Champlain where you can take a boat ride and go to Ethan
E12 0430 Allen Park. There you'll witness a view which includes the Adirondack
E12 0440 Mts& and the Winooski River.   Now you're ready for
E12 0450 a whirlwind sightseeing tour of America's most exciting city. The
E12 0460 skyline, the bridges, Broadway, and the Staten Island ferry are
E12 0470 only a few of the spots to put on your "must" list for New York
E12 0480 City. #PHOTOGRAPHING IN THE NORTHEAST# Some tips for shooting in
E12 0490 Northeastern locales: In New York City don't miss coverage
E12 0500 of the United Nations. These striking, modernistic buildings on the
E12 0510 East River are open to the public and every weekday guided tours are
E12 0520 available. Pictures can be taken in the public areas and when on tours.
E12 0530 However, the use of tripods is not allowed. Photos of Conference
E12 0540 Rooms and the General Assembly Hall can be made when these rooms
E12 0550 are not being used for meetings. Flash is allowed, subject to above
E12 0560 restrictions.   Around New England, you'll no doubt want a
E12 0570 color shot of one of the picturesque lighthouses. Be careful here not
E12 0580 to overexpose this subject since they are extremely bright and
E12 0590 light-reflecting.
E12 0600 In color, 1/50th of a second between **f and **f will do for
E12 0610 bright, frontal sunlight. #THE SOUTH# THE SOUTHERN United
E12 0620 States, extending from Florida in the east to Texas in the west,
E12 0630 still maintains its unique flavor of gracious living and historical elegance.
E12 0640 It encompasses in its expanse areas where the natural beauty
E12 0650 encourages a vacation of quiet contemplation, on the one hand, to places
E12 0660 where entertainment and spectacles of all sorts have been provided
E12 0670 for the tourist with camera.   Of special interest this anniversary
E12 0680 year of the war between the states are the many Civil War battlefields
E12 0690 where, likely as not, you'll catch some memorial re-enactments.
E12 0700 Among the locales to visit are Shiloh, Tennessee; Lookout Mountain,
E12 0710 Tennessee; Vicksburg, Mississippi; Richmond, Virginia;
E12 0720 Petersburg, Virginia, and Fredericksburg, Virginia.   Florida
E12 0730 provides tropical scenes unequalled in the United States. At
E12 0740 Cypress Gardens special bleachers are set up for photographers at water-ski
E12 0750 shows and lovely models pose for pictures in garden settings.
E12 0760 Silver Springs features glass-bottom boat rides and in Everglades National
E12 0770 Park there are opportunities to photograph rare wildlife. Miami
E12 0780 Beach and surroundings feature fabulous "hotel row", palm-studded
E12 0790 beaches plus the Miami Seaquarium and Parrot Jungle.
E12 0800 One of the most delightful spots in a southern tour is the city of New
E12 0810 Orleans. The famous old French and Spanish buildings with their
E12 0820 elaborate wrought iron balconies and the narrow streets of the Latin
E12 0830 Quarter present an Old World scene.   For restoration of early
E12 0840 American life the places to visit are Williamsburg, Jamestown and
E12 0850 Yorktown, Virginia. Another Virginia sight and a photographic adventure
E12 0860 are the Luray Caverns, lit by photofloodlights.   The
E12 0870 great state of Texas offers metropolitan attractions such as the Dallas
E12 0880 Fair Park with its art and natural history museums. In contrast
E12 0890 are the vast open stretches of ranch country and oil wells. In San
E12 0900 Antonio visit the famous Alamo and photograph 18th Century Spanish
E12 0910 buildings and churches.   The Great Smoky Mountains is another
E12 0920 area of the South well worth a visit. Along the 127-mile route through
E12 0930 Great Smoky Mountains National Park you can photograph the
E12 0940 breath-taking peaks, gorges and valleys which come into view at every
E12 0950 turn. Gatlinburg, Tennessee, is the center of this area. Another scenic
E12 0960 spot in Tennessee is Chattanooga where the Rock City Gardens
E12 0970 are not to be missed.   Beautiful homes and gardens are trademarks
E12 0980 of the South and cities particularly noted for them are Charleston,
E12 0990 S&C&, Natchez, Miss&, and Savannah, Ga&. At Charlottesville,
E12 1000 Va&, shoot Monticello and the beautiful buildings of the
E12 1010 University. #PICTURING THE SOUTH# Foliage is the outstanding photo
E12 1020 subject in many of the Southern locales mentioned above and some
E12 1030 specific tips on how and where to shoot it are in order. For example,
E12 1040 the Chamber of Commerce of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, sponsors special
E12 1050 camera tours into the Great Smoky Mountains to get pictures of the
E12 1060 profusion of wild flowers flourishing in these wooded regions.
E12 1070    Exposure problems may occur in these forest areas where uneven lighting
E12 1080 results from shafts of sunlight filtering through the overhead branches.
E12 1090 Best solution is to find an area that is predominantly sunlight
E12 1100 or shade. In any instance, you should determine the exposure according
E12 1110 to the type of light which falls on most of the subject area.
E12 1120    Try some closeups on Southern blossoms to provide a welcome contrast
E12 1130 with the many long-view scenics you'll be making.   For
E12 1140 shooting the interiors of the famous ante-bellum Southern mansions make
E12 1150 sure your equipment includes a tripod. Enough daylight is usually
E12 1160 available from the windows, but if you have synchronized flash- use
E12 1170 it.   For some unusual photographic subjects, if your vacation takes
E12 1180 you nearby, try these events: the 600-mile auto race in Charlotte,
E12 1190 N& C&, on May 27; the Florida Folk Festival, White Springs,
E12 1200 May 5-7; Singing on the Mountain in Linville, North Carolina,
E12 1210 on June 25. Peak action photography is your goal at Miami's
E12 1220 Seaquarium and the Cypress Gardens waterskiing events. #THE
E12 1230 MIDWEST# A PLEASANT start to your midwestern vacation is a few
E12 1240 days spent in cosmopolitan Chicago. Lake Michigan offers swimming
E12 1250 and pictures which combine cityscapes with beaches. A visit to Chicago's
E12 1260 museums and a stroll around broad Michigan Avenue will unfold
E12 1270 many photogenic subjects to the alert photographer.   Wisconsin
E12 1280 Dells, where fantastically scenic rocks carved by the Wisconsin River
E12 1290 are overgrown with fern and other foliage, rates a stopover when
E12 1300 traveling from Chicago.   The farmlands forming the heart of America
E12 1310 stretch out across the Midwest from Chicago. In North Dakota
E12 1320 the strangely beautiful Badlands will challenge you to translate its
E12 1330 wonder on to film. While here, visit Theodore Roosevelt National
E12 1340 Park for its spectacular scenery.   Another spot with an image-provoking
E12 1350 name is the Black Hills where you can visit the old frontier
E12 1360 mining town of Deadwood. The Black Hills Passion Play is produced
E12 1370 every summer and is a pageant worth seeing and shooting.
E12 1380 Of course, while in this vicinity you won't want to miss a visit to
E12 1390 Mount Rushmore National Memorial where on the side of a mountain
E12 1400 are the famous sculptures of Presidents Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson
E12 1410 and Theodore Roosevelt.   In Missouri (which we are including
E12 1420 in our general Midwest region) you can glance into Mark Twain's
E12 1430 birthplace at Hannibal, see the landmarks of his life and writings
E12 1440 and visualize where Huck Finn hatched his boyish mischief.
E12 1450    Similarly in Illinois there is Lincoln country to be seen- his
E12 1460 tomb and other landmarks.   Minnesota, fabled land of waters, is
E12 1470 in itself, ideal vacationland,
E12 1480 having within its borders 10,000 lakes!
E12 1490 Itasca State Park, where the Mississippi River begins, is one
E12 1500 of the outstanding tourist spots in Minnesota.   Mementoes of the
E12 1510 Old West recall the days of Wyatt Earp in Dodge City, Nebraska,
E12 1520 where present-day cowboys add a colorful human interest note to your
E12 1530 vacation shooting.   Of current interest is Abilene, Kansas,
E12 1540 the birthplace of ex-President Eisenhower. There's a museum here
E12 1550 and also Old Abilene Town, a reconstruction of the cattle boomtown
E12 1560 of the 70's and 80's.   For a resort area, Mackinack Island,
E12 1570 Michigan, is the place to visit. It truly relives another age for
E12 1580 the inhabitants use carriages rather than autos and old British and
E12 1590 French forts are left intact for tourists to visit and record. #PICTURES
E12 1600 OF THE MIDWEST# Night scenes will add an exciting touch to
E12 1610 your vacation travelogue and what better place to take them then along
E12 1620 Chicago's Lake Shore Drive? Just after sunset is a good time
E12 1630 to record the city lights in color since you get a "fill-in" light
E12 1640 from the sky.   Another memo for sightseers: bring your camera
E12 1650 along to museums. Photos of historic dioramas of the area you visit
E12 1660 will add depth and background to your vacation photo story. Again,
E12 1670 be sure your tripod is handy for those sometimes-necessary time exposures.
E12 1680    Special events and their dates which will make interesting
E12 1690 shooting in the Midwest area, include the following:   A re-enactment
E12 1700 of the Battle of Lexington, May 18th at Lexington, Missouri;
E12 1710 the world-renowned 500-mile auto race at Indianapolis, Indiana,
E12 1720 plus a festival from May 27-30; "Song of Hiawatha", in
E12 1730 Elgin, Illinois, from June 20 to 24th. Michigan offers the lovely
E12 1740 Tulip Festival in Holland, Michigan, May 12-14; the ~USGA
E12 1750 Open in Birmingham from June 15-17; and the International Freedom
E12 1760 Festival in Detroit, June 29-July 4.   For early vacationers
E12 1770 there's the fun-filled Fishing Derby in Hot Springs, Arkansas,
E12 1780 April 19-23, and the Arkansas Band Festival in Hot Springs,
E12 1790 April 20-22. #THE WEST# A WESTERN VACATION is practically
E12 1800 synonymous with a visit to at least one of the magnificent national parks
E12 1810 in this area. A tour of several of them is possible in a two-week
E12 1820 vacation while a stay at just one of these natural beauty spots can
E12 1830 be of equal reward.   In California is located one of the most
E12 1840 popular of the national parks- Yosemite. Among its most spectacular
E12 1850 features are its falls, the highest being Upper Yosemite which drops
E12 1860 2,425 feet. The Sequoia Grove presents another unique aspect of
E12 1870 Yosemite, for these ancient giant trees are a sight never to be forgotten.
E12 1880    In the Utah area are Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon
E12 1890 National Park. Fantastic colors are to be seen in the fanciful
E12 1900 formations of eroded rock which loom out of the semiarid country in
E12 1910 both parks.   Colorado's Grand Canyon, probably the most famous
E12 1920 landmark of the United States, can be the highpoint of your Western
E12 1930 vacation.
E13 0010    BUILT UPON seven hills, Istanbul, like Rome, is one of
E13 0020 the most ancient cities in the world, filled with splendor and contrast.
E13 0030 It is an exotic place, so different from the ordinary that the casual
E13 0040 tourist is likely to see at first only the contrast and the ugliness
E13 0050 of narrow streets lined with haphazard houses. At the moment, many
E13 0060 of these are being pulled down. Whole blocks are disappearing and more
E13 0070 are scheduled to vanish to make room for wide boulevards that will
E13 0080 show off its treasures to better advantage- the great domes and graceful
E13 0090 spires of its mosques, the panorama of the Bosphorus and the Golden
E13 0100 Horn. Even when they are finished, however, the contrast will
E13 0110 remain, for Istanbul is the only city in the world that is built upon
E13 0120 two continents. For almost 3,000 years Europe and Asia have rubbed
E13 0130 shoulders in its streets.   Founded in the Ninth Century B&C&
E13 0140 it was called Byzantium 200 years later when Byzas, ruler of
E13 0150 the Megarians, expanded the settlement and named it after himself. About
E13 0160 a thousand years after that, when the Roman Empire was divided,
E13 0170 it became capital of the Eastern section. On May 11, 330 A&D&,
E13 0180 its name was changed again, this time to Constantinople after its
E13 0190 emperor, Constantine. In 1453 when the last vestige of ancient Roman
E13 0200 power fell to the Turks, the city officially shifted religions-
E13 0210 although the Patriarch, or Pope, of the Orthodox Church continued
E13 0220 to live there, and still does- and became the capital of the Ottoman
E13 0230 Empire. When <that> was broken up after the First World War,
E13 0240 its name was changed once more. Rich in Christian and Moslem art,
E13 0250 Istanbul is today a fascinating museum of East and West that
E13 0260 recently
E13 0270 became a seaside resort as well with the development of new beaches on
E13 0280 the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara only a short distance from the
E13 0290 center of town. Easy to get to, and becoming more popular every year,
E13 0300 it is only fourteen hours from New York by Pan American World
E13 0310 Airways jet, four hours from Rome. #START OF TOUR# Most of the
E13 0320 sights lie in the old section across the Golden Horn from the modern
E13 0330 hotels. I started my tour of them at the Turkish Government Tourist
E13 0340 Office, next to Pan American's office on the left as you enter
E13 0350 the driveway that leads to the Hilton Hotel. From there I turned
E13 0360 left along Cumhuriyet Cadesi past more hotels and a park on the left,
E13 0370 Republic Gardens, and came in a few moments to Taksim Square, one
E13 0380 of the hubs of the city, with the Monument of the Republic, erected
E13 0390 in 1928, in its center.   Directly across from the Gardens I
E13 0400 found a bus stop sign for ~T 4 and rode it down to the Bosphorus,
E13 0410 with the sports center on my left just before I reached the water and
E13 0420 the entrance to Dolmabahce Palace immediately after that. There
E13 0430 the bus turned right along the Bosphorus, past ocean liners at anchor,
E13 0440 to Galata Bridge over the entrance to the Golden Horn, a brown sweep
E13 0450 of water that empties into the Bosphorus. Across the bridge on
E13 0460 the left I saw St& Sophia with its sturdy brown minarets and to the
E13 0470 right of them the slenderer spires of the Blue Mosque.   On
E13 0480 the other side of the Golden Horn I rode through Eminonu Square,
E13 0490 with Yeni Cami, or the New Mosque, which dates from the Seventeenth
E13 0500 Century, just across from the entrance to the bridge. Passing it,
E13 0510 the bus climbed a hill, with the covered spice bazaar on the right and
E13 0520 Pandelli's, a famous and excellent restaurant, above it. At the
E13 0530 top of the hill the buildings on the left gave way to a park. I got
E13 0540 off there, crossed the street, walked ahead with St& Sophia on my
E13 0550 left, the Blue Mosque on my right, and in a moment came to the entrance
E13 0560 of St& Sophia.   Erected on the site of pagan temples and
E13 0570 three previous St& Sophias, the first of which was begun by Constantine,
E13 0580 this fourth church was started by Justinian in 532 and completed
E13 0590 twenty years later. On his first trip to the finished structure
E13 0600 he boasted that he had built a temple grander than Solomon's in Jerusalem.
E13 0610 A few years later the dome fell in. Nevertheless, it remained
E13 0620 one of the most splendid churches of the Eastern Empire, where
E13 0630 the Byzantine Emperors were crowned. After the Turks conquered the
E13 0640 city in 1453 they converted it to a mosque, adding the stubby minarets.
E13 0650 In the second half of the Sixteenth Century, Sinan, the great architect
E13 0660 who is the Michelangelo of the East, designed the massive buttresses
E13 0670 that now help support the dome. With the birth of the Turkish
E13 0680 Republic after the First World War, St& Sophia became a museum,
E13 0690 and the ancient mosaics, which were plastered over by the Moslems,
E13 0700 whose religion forbids pictures in holy places, have been restored.
E13 0710    Inside over the first door I saw one of these, which shows
E13 0720 Constantine offering the city to the Virgin Mary and Justinian offering
E13 0730 the temple. On the columns around the immense dome are round plaques
E13 0740 with Arabic writing. The eight green columns, I learned, came
E13 0750 from the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, the others, red, from the Temple
E13 0760 of the Sun at Heliopolis.   Beneath the dome I saw the
E13 0770 spot where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned, a bit of floor protected
E13 0780 now by a wooden fence. Behind this is a minber or Moslem pulpit
E13 0790 and near it a raised platform with golden grillwork, where the emperors
E13 0800 and, after them, the sultans, sat. Directly opposite is the emperor's
E13 0810 door, through which they entered the building.   Outside
E13 0820 St& Sophia I walked through the flower garden in front of it, with
E13 0830 the Blue Mosque ahead on my left. Across the street on my right I
E13 0840 saw the Hippodrome, now a park. It was laid out in 196 for chariot
E13 0850 races and other public games. Statues and other monuments that stood
E13 0860 there were stolen, mostly by the waves of Crusaders.   At
E13 0870 the beginning of the Hippodrome I saw the Kaiser's Fountain, an
E13 0880 ugly octagonal building with a glass dome, built in 1895 by the German
E13 0890 Emperor, and on my left, directly across from it, the tomb of Sultan
E13 0900 Ahmet, who constructed the Blue Mosque, more properly known by
E13 0910 his name.   Just before coming to the mosque entrance I crossed
E13 0920 the street, entered the Hippodrome, and walked ahead to the Obelisk
E13 0930 of Theodosius, originally erected in Heliopolis in Egypt about 1,600
E13 0940 B&C& by Thutmose, who also built those now in New York,
E13 0950 London and Rome at the Lateran. This one was set up here in 390 A&D&
E13 0960 on a pedestal, the faces of which are carved with statues of
E13 0970 the emperor and his family watching games in the Hippodrome, done so
E13 0980 realistically that the obelisk itself is included in them.   Beyond
E13 0990 it I noted a small green column, about twelve feet below the present
E13 1000 ground level- the Serpentine Column, three entwined serpents,
E13 1010 which once stood at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece. Near
E13 1020 the end of the Hippodrome I came upon the Built Column, a truncated
E13 1030 obelisk of blocks, all that remains of a monument that once rivalled
E13 1040 the Colossus of Rhodes. #MAGNIFICENT MOSQUE# Retracing my steps
E13 1050 to the Mosque of Sultan Ahmet, only one with six minarets, I entered
E13 1060 the courtyard, with a gallery supported by pointed arches running
E13 1070 around it and a fountain in the middle. One of the most beautiful
E13 1080 buildings in Istanbul, it was constructed in the early years of the Seventeenth
E13 1090 Century, with a huge central dome, two half domes that seem
E13 1100 to cascade down from it, and smaller full domes around the gallery.
E13 1110 The round minarets, tall and graceful, rise from rectangular bases and
E13 1120 have three platforms from which the muezzin can chant his call to prayer.
E13 1130 Inside, the walls are covered with blue and white tile, the floor
E13 1140 with red and cream carpets.   Back at the Kaiser's Fountain,
E13 1150 I walked left to the streetcar stop and rode up the hill- any
E13 1160 car will do- past the Column of Constantine, also known as the Burnt
E13 1170 Column, at the top on my right. It stands in the middle of what
E13 1180 was once the Forum of Constantine, who brought it from Rome.
E13 1190    I stayed on the car for a few minutes until, turning right, it entered
E13 1200 a huge square, Bayezit, with the Bayezit Mosque on the right and
E13 1210 the gate to the university just beyond it. There I got off, crossed
E13 1220 the square, and on the side directly opposite the gate found a good
E13 1230 restaurant, hard to come by in this part of the city. Called the Marmara
E13 1240 Gazinosu, it is on the third floor, with signs pointing the way
E13 1250 there, and has a terrace overlooking the Sea of Marmara. After lunch,
E13 1260 in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street I found a
E13 1270 pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava- a sweet, flaky cake-
E13 1280 in Istanbul. It's a great favorite of the university students,
E13 1290 and I joined them there for dessert.   Taking the streetcar back
E13 1300 to Kaiser's Fountain, I walked ahead, then left down the street
E13 1310 opposite St& Sophia and just beyond the corner came to a small,
E13 1320 one-story building with a red-tile roof, which is the entrance to the
E13 1330 Sunken Palace. Actually an underground cistern, its roof supported
E13 1340 by rows and rows of pillars, it was built by Justinian in the Sixth
E13 1350 Century to supply the palace with water. There is still water in it.
E13 1360 I found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately.
E13 1370 Outside I walked past the entrance to St& Sophia, turned left at
E13 1380 the end of it, and continued toward a gate in the wall ahead. Just
E13 1390 before reaching it I came to a grey and brown stone building that looks
E13 1400 somewhat like an Oriental pagoda, with Arabic lettering in gold and
E13 1410 colored tile decorations- the Fountain of Sultan Ahmet.
E13 1420    Going through the Imperial Gate in the wall, I entered the grounds
E13 1430 of Topkapi Palace, home of the Sultans and nerve center of the vast
E13 1440 Ottoman Empire, and walked along a road toward another gate in the
E13 1450 distance, past the Church of St& Irene, completed by Constantine
E13 1460 in 330 A&D& on my left, and then, just outside the second
E13 1470 gate, I saw a spring with a tap in the wall on my right- the Executioner's
E13 1480 Spring, where he washed his hands and his sword after beheading
E13 1490 his victims.   Passing through the gate, with towers on either
E13 1500 side once used as prisons, I entered a huge square surrounded by
E13 1510 buildings, and on the wall to my right found a general plan of the grounds,
E13 1520 with explanations in English for each building. There are a
E13 1530 good many of them. At one time about 10,000 people lived there.
E13 1540    Following arrowed signs, I veered right toward the former kitchens,
E13 1550 complete with chimneys, which now house one of the world's greatest
E13 1560 collections of Chinese porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner
E13 1570 services. Next to it is a copper section, with cooking utensils
E13 1580 and a figure of the chief cook in an elaborate, floor-length robe.
E13 1590    In the court once more, I went right toward the Reception House,
E13 1600 a long one-story building with a deep portico. Going through a door
E13 1610 into another small court, I had the Throne Room directly in front.
E13 1620 I walked to the right around it to buildings containing illuminated
E13 1630 manuscripts and came to the Treasury, which houses such things as coffee
E13 1640 cups covered with diamonds, jewelled swords, rifles glittering with
E13 1650 diamonds and huge divan-like thrones as large as small beds, on which
E13 1660 the sultans sat cross-legged. They are made of gold and covered with
E13 1670 emeralds, pearls and other jewels.   Taking the path behind
E13 1680 the Throne Room to the building directly beyond it, the Portrait Gallery,
E13 1690 I went right at the end of it, through a garden to a small building
E13 1700 at the back- a sitting room furnished with low blue divans, its
E13 1710 floor covered with carpets, its ceiling painted with gold squares and
E13 1720 floral designs.
E14 0010    <DO> start fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain
E14 0011 a
E14 0020 lasting bed of glowing coals. Keep ashes from one barbecue to the next
E14 0030 to sprinkle over coals if they are too hot, and to stop flames that
E14 0040 arise from melting grease.   <Do> line barbecue fire bowl
E14 0041 with
E14 0050 heavy foil to reflect heat.   <Don't> forget to buy a plastic
E14 0060 pastry brush for basting with sauces. Clean it meticulously in boiling
E14 0070 water and detergent, rinse thoroughly.   <Do> build a wall
E14 0080 of glowing coals six to eight inches in front of meat that is barbecued
E14 0090 on an electric spit. Make use of the back of the barbecue or of the
E14 0100 hood for heating vegetables, sauces and such.   <Don't>
E14 0110 fail to shorten cooking time by the use of aluminum foil cut slightly
E14 0120 larger than the surface of steaks and chops. Sear on both sides then
E14 0130 cover meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest results.
E14 0140    <Do> avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test them. If doubtful
E14 0150 about a steak, boldly cut it in half. If necessary to replace
E14 0160 both halves on grill, sear cuts and allot extra time. For roasts, insert
E14 0170 meat thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone. Also make
E14 0180 sure thermometer does not touch the revolving spit or hit the coals.
E14 0190    <Don't> practice a new recipe on guests. Have a test-run
E14 0200 on the family first, to be sure timing and seasoning are right.
E14 0210    <Do> buy meat the day or the day before you intend to cook it. Keep
E14 0220 it no longer than 36 hours before cooking, and keep it in the coldest
E14 0230 (but non-freezing) compartment of the refrigerator.   <Don't>
E14 0240 plan meals that are too complicated. Limit yourself to good meat
E14 0250 and drink, with bread, salad, corn or potatoes as accessories. Keep
E14 0260 the desserts simple; fruit does nicely.   <Do> whatever kitchen
E14 0270 work, such as fixing a salad, preparing garlic bread, or making
E14 0280 a marinade sauce, ahead of time. When you start the outdoor performance,
E14 0290 you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen.
E14 0300 (This goes for getting a drink tray ready, and for having a big cooler
E14 0310 full of ice on hand long before the party begins.)
E14 0311 <Don't>
E14 0320 think you have to start with the most expensive equipment in the
E14 0330 world. The simplest grill (pan type) or inexpensive hibachi can make
E14 0340 you a chef. You need tongs to handle meat; long forks for turning
E14 0350 potatoes and corn; heavy foil on hand at all times. And lots of hot
E14 0360 pads!   <Do> keep the grill high enough above the fire so that
E14 0370 when fat from meat drips down and flares up, flames cannot reach the
E14 0380 meat.   <Don't> forget to have a supply of Melamine plates,
E14 0390 bowls, cups, saucers, and platters for outdoor use. Made of the world's
E14 0400 toughest unbreakable plastic, Melamine dinnerware comes in almost
E14 0410 400 different patterns and dozens of colors. There is even one
E14 0420 set that has "barbecue" written on it.   <Do> without fancy
E14 0430 tablecloths. It's cheaper to buy Wall-Tex and cover your outdoor
E14 0440 table. Or buy half a dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns
E14 0450 for different kinds of barbecues. Oilcloth only costs about 79~c a
E14 0460 yard for the very best. Tougher than plastic, it wears well.
E14 0470 <Don't> forget- when you take to the hills or the beach- that
E14 0480 your cooler, which you might have used for wine- or beer-cooling on your
E14 0490 terrace or back yard, is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments.
E14 0500 There are many varieties of coolers and they serve many purposes.
E14 0510 With them, you can carry steaks and hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures,
E14 0520 and also get your frozen food for stews and chowders, to the
E14 0530 marina or picnic, in A-1 condition.   <Do> use paper napkins;
E14 0540 lots of them. Except when you prepare "do it yourself" shish
E14 0550 kebob or a lobster roast. Then you'll want terry cloth towels
E14 0560 for mopping up.   <Don't> think barbecue cooking is just sometimes,
E14 0570 or seasonal. It's year-round, and everywhere. In the winter,
E14 0580 hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs of the fireplace. Even
E14 0590 use your portable electric or gas grill in the winter, inside. Summertime
E14 0600 supper, outside, is a natural. You'll find, once your technique
E14 0610 is perfected, that you can cook on a boat with a simple Bernz-O-Matic.
E14 0620    <Do> buy all-purpose mugs or cups. Get copper or
E14 0630 earthenware mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot. Be sure to get
E14 0640 a few more than you need. You will discover you keep the sauce for basting
E14 0650 meat in one, use six for drinks, serve soup or coffee in another
E14 0660 half-dozen- and need one more to mix the salad dressing.   <Don't>
E14 0670 forget the joys of a meal on the road. If you travel over the
E14 0680 vast U&S&A& you will, no doubt, discover that feeding is an
E14 0690 expensive business. Decide in the beginning to put your barbecue equipment
E14 0700 to work. You <can> take it with you **h a picnic bag, a
E14 0710 grill,
E14 0720 a cooler for soft drinks and beer, and for frozen convenience foods. Eat
E14 0730 in a restaurant or motel mornings and evenings; or just evenings.
E14 0740 Turn off at any one of the marked picnic areas (gasoline companies
E14 0750 have touring service bureaus that issue booklets on national parks to
E14 0760 tell you where you have barbecue facilities) and- with soft drinks
E14 0770 cooled from morning loading up, hamburger, buns, an array of relishes,
E14 0780 and fresh fruit- your lunch is 75% cheaper than at a restaurant,
E14 0790 and 100% more fun. You need a little stove, a coffee pot and a stew
E14 0800 pot; maybe a skillet, a basket of essentials like salt, pepper, plates,
E14 0810 forks, knives and a can opener. As you pull out of your motel or
E14 0820 national park home-for-the-night, visit a market and buy just what you
E14 0830 need for the next meal. For 25~c load up the cooler with ice and
E14 0840 keep cool pop in the car.
E14 0850 #SIMPLE MEAT DISHES# SPICE is a fact of
E14 0860 life in the U&S&A&. You only have to think of franks and sausages
E14 0870 to know what I mean. Go a step further and list all the wonderful
E14 0880 barbecue basics- cervelat, salami, Vienna sausages, mettwurst,
E14 0890 bratwurst, bockwurst, knackwurst, Bologna, pepperoni, blutwurst- and
E14 0900 you have a long list of easy specialties. Threaded on a skewer with
E14 0910 new boiled potatoes, a bit of green pepper, a fresh white mushroom-
E14 0920 any one of these spiced meats makes a man a cook, and a meal a feast.
E14 0930    Sure, for the most of us, a frankfurter is the favorite. A
E14 0940 story goes that a certain Herr Feuchtwanger of St& Louis, around
E14 0950 1883 served his sausages (grilled) and mustard to his fancy customers.
E14 0960 So that his customers should not soil their hands, Feuchtwanger issued
E14 0970 white gloves. Discovery that the gloves frequently left with the
E14 0980 customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat come upon a compromise.
E14 0990 He had a bakery make buns sized to fit his franks. Years later,
E14 1000 franks-in-buns were accepted as the "first to go" at the New
E14 1010 York Polo Grounds.   The nations's number one picnic treat
E14 1020 is the skinless frankfurter- toasted over a bonfire on the beach or,
E14 1030 more sedately, charcoal broiled on a portable grill. Either way it's
E14 1040 hard to beat in flavor as well as ease of preparation. To make the
E14 1050 picnic frank come close to perfection, remember these tips:
E14 1060    -Score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of
E14 1070 the way through. This permits the juices to permeate the meat during
E14 1080 cooking.   -Relishes are as vital to the success of the frank
E14 1090 as are buns. Bring along the conventional ones- catsup, pickle relish,
E14 1100 mustard, mayonnaise- plus a few extras, such as tangy barbecue
E14 1110 sauce, chive cream cheese, or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd.
E14 1120    -Using a portable grill permits you to toast the buns,
E14 1130 too. Watch closely while browning them, as it doesn't take long.
E14 1140    -An unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating the franks
E14 1150 in French dressing or a mixture of honey, lemon juice and brown sugar
E14 1160 prior to the picnic. Broil or toast as usual.   Contrary to
E14 1170 popular opinion, "a la mode" doesn't mean "with ice cream"-
E14 1180 it just means, in the latest style. Here are a couple of the latest,
E14 1190 highly styled ways to fix skinless franks in your own back yard!
E14 1195 You'll
E14 1200 have the neighbor's eyes popping as well as their mouths watering!
E14 1210 _JIFFY BARBECUES_ {1 cup chili sauce 1/3 cup water 1 tablespoon
E14 1220 barbecue sauce 2 teaspoons prepared mustard 1/2 pound chipped,
E14 1230 spiced ham 6 sandwich buns, heated}   Combine first 4 ingredients
E14 1240 in saucepan; heat thoroughly. Add ham; heat. Serve on buns.
E14 1250 Makes 6 barbecues. _HOT HIBACHI FRANKS_ You'll never hear "sayonara",
E14 1260 the Japanese word for goodbye, from your guests when you
E14 1270 give a hibachi party. The fun of toasting their own sausages over the
E14 1280 small Oriental charcoal burners and dipping them in tasty sauces
E14 1285 will
E14 1290 keep your group busy- try it and see! _CANNED COCKTAIL FRANKFURTERS_
E14 1300 _SWEET-SOUR SAUCE_ {1 large onion, chopped fine 2 tablespoons
E14 1310 salad oil 1 8-oz& can crushed pineapple and 1/2 cup of the juice
E14 1320 1/4 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons vinegar 1 tablespoon prepared mustard
E14 1330 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce} _PINEAPPLE CHUNKS_ _MUSTARD
E14 1340 CREAM_ {2 tablespoons dry mustard Water 1/2 cup heavy
E14 1350 cream, whipped Salt Paprika}   Spear canned cocktail franks
E14 1360 with picks. Also spear pineapple chunks and place in separate bowl.
E14 1370    Make sauces ahead. Sweet-sour sauce can be kept warm over a second
E14 1380 hibachi or chafing dish while charcoal in broiler is reaching glowing
E14 1390 coal stage. Mustard cream, used as alternate dip for franks and
E14 1400 pineapple tidbits, tastes best when served at room temperature.
E14 1410 For sweet-sour sauce, cook onion in oil until soft. Add remaining ingredients
E14 1420 and bring to a boil. Simmer about 10 minutes, and keep warm
E14 1430 for serving.   To prepare mustard cream, blend mustard with enough
E14 1440 water to make a thin paste. Fold into whipped cream and add a dash
E14 1450 of salt and sprinkling of paprika. _TRIM-YOUR-OWN-FRANKS_ A back-yard
E14 1460 picnic with grilled frankfurters and a selection of frankfurter
E14 1470 trimmings is a fine way to entertain guests this summer. Be sure to
E14 1480 have plenty of frankfurters and buns on hand. Some tasty frank toppings
E14 1490 are chili con carne, Coney Island sauce and savory sauerkraut. Serve
E14 1500 the chili and kraut hot with the franks.   Here are suggestions
E14 1510 for the frankfurter trimmings: _1._ Chili con carne: use
E14 1520 canned chili con carne. _2._ Coney Island sauce: finely chop
E14 1530 several onions and add enough catsup to moisten well; add prepared
E14 1540 mustard to suit taste. _3._ Savory sauerkraut: add several tablespoons
E14 1550 of brown sugar to a can of sauerkraut. Add a few caraway seeds,
E14 1560 too, if you'd like. _BARBECUED FRANKFURTERS_ {1/2 cup minced
E14 1570 celery 1/4 cup minced onion 1/2 cup tomato ketchup 1/2 cup water 1/4
E14 1580 cup vinegar 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
E14 1590 1 tablespoon prepared mustard 1/2 teaspoon salt 8 frankfurters}
E14 1600    Combine first 9 ingredients in skillet. Simmer 15 minutes. Prick
E14 1610 frankfurters with fork; place in sauce. Cover; simmer 15 minutes,
E14 1620 stirring occasionally, until sauce is of desired consistency. Serve
E14 1630 in frankfurter buns or as a meat dish. Makes 8 sandwiches or 4
E14 1640 servings. _PRETEND HAM_ Make criss-cross gashes on one side of skinless
E14 1650 frankfurters. Stick 4 or 5 cloves in each frank, ham fashion.
E14 1660 Make a paste of brown sugar and mustard and spread lightly over scored
E14 1670 surface. If desired, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon drained crushed pineapple.
E14 1680 Place on rectangle of foil and pinch edges together tightly. Roast
E14 1690 on grill over coals 15-20 minutes. _FRANKFURTER TWISTS_ Blend
E14 1700 2 cups biscuit mix with 2/3 cup milk to make a soft dough. Knead on
E14 1710 lightly floured board and roll out to form a **f-inch rectangle. Spread
E14 1720 dough with a mixture of 3 tablespoons chili sauce, 1 teaspoon horse-radish
E14 1730 and 2 teaspoons mustard. Cut dough carefully into 12 strips,
E14 1740 about 3/4 inch by a foot long. Twist one strip diagonally around each
E14 1750 skinless frankfurter, pinching dough at ends to seal it. Brush frankfurter
E14 1760 twists with about 1/2 cup melted butter and toast slowly over
E14 1770 glowing coals until dough is golden brown. Serves 12. _HAMBURGER PATTIES
E14 1780 WITH NUTS_ {1 pound ground beef 2 teaspoons grated onion Dash
E14 1790 of pepper 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup chopped walnuts 1/4 cup ice cold
E14 1800 bourbon}   Combine ingredients; form into patties and barbecue
E14 1810 5 minutes on each side.
E15 0010 _NOTE:_ Directions are written for those who have had previous
E15 0020 experience in making pottery. Instructions for preparing clay, drying,
E15 0030 glazing and firing are not given. #EQUIPMENT:# Basic pottery
E15 0040 studio equipment. Wooden butter molds and cookie presses. #MATERIALS:#
E15 0050 Ceramic modeling clay: red, white or buff. Stoneware clay
E15 0060 for tiles. Glazes, one-stroke ceramic colors, stains, cones as indicated
E15 0070 in the individual instructions. #GENERAL DIRECTIONS:# Use
E15 0080 well-wedged clay,
E15 0090 free of air bubbles and pliable enough to bend without
E15 0100 cracking. Clean wooden molds and presses thoroughly; they must be
E15 0110 free of oil, wax and dust. _PRESSING DESIGNS:_ The size of wooden
E15 0120 mold will determine the amount of clay needed. Roll clay to thickness
E15 0130 indicated in individual instructions. Whenever possible, use the
E15 0140 wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay. When mold has more than one
E15 0150 design cavity, make individual paper patterns. Place mold or paper
E15 0160 pattern on rolled clay and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position
E15 0170 (cut more pieces than required for project to make allowance for
E15 0180 defects; experiment with defects for decoration techniques of glazes
E15 0190 and colors). Place the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity
E15 0200 design side of wooden mold. To obtain clear impression of mold, press
E15 0210 clay gently but firmly into mold cavity, starting at center and working
E15 0220 to outer edges. Trim excess clay away from outer edges. Check thickness
E15 0230 of clay and build up thin areas by moistening surface with a little
E15 0240 water and adding small pieces of clay. Be sure to press the additional
E15 0250 clay firmly into place without locking in air bubbles. Allow
E15 0260 project to stand for about five minutes (if wooden press mold is a good
E15 0270 antique, do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold
E15 0280 to crack).   To release clay from mold, place hands in a cupped
E15 0290 position around project; gently lift the edge on far side, then continue
E15 0300 to release edge completely around mold. Slight tapping on the
E15 0310 underside of mold will help release the clay, but too much agitation will
E15 0320 cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay
E15 0330 from mold. Place a piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on
E15 0340 clay and reverse bat, clay and mold in one action. This will prevent
E15 0350 the clay from twisting or bending, causing warping when fired. Place
E15 0360 project on table and carefully lift the mold off. Study surface of clay
E15 0370 for defects or desired corrections. If clay is slightly out of shape,
E15 0380 square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against
E15 0390 opposite sides, or smooth round pieces with damp fingers. if the background
E15 0400 of design is too smooth, or you wish to create a wood-grained effect,
E15 0410 it may be added at this time with a dull tool such as the handle
E15 0420 of a fine paintbrush. Make slight, smooth grooves rather than cuts
E15 0430 for the texture (cuts could cause air pockets under the glaze creating
E15 0440 pinholes or craters in the glaze during firing). Leave the clay on
E15 0450 plaster board to dry slowly, covered lightly with a loose piece of plastic
E15 0460 or cloth to prevent warping. #RECTANGULAR TILES# (opposite page,
E15 0470 right top): Stoneware clay was used. Clay was rolled to 1/4''
E15 0480 thickness. Back of clay scored or roughened for proper gripping
E15 0490 surface. No bisque firing. glazed with two coats of Creek-Turn white
E15 0500 stoneware glaze (no glaze on sides or bottom). Decorated on unfired
E15 0510 glaze with one coat of one-stroke ceramic colors; raised details of
E15 0520 designs were colored in shades of yellow-green, blue-green, brown and
E15 0530 pink. Tiles were fired once to cone 05. #ROUND PLAQUE# (opposite
E15 0540 page, bottom): White clay was used, rolled to 1/4'' thickness.
E15 0550 Bisque fired to cone 05. Stained with Jacquelyn's ceramic unfired
E15 0560 stain, polished, following manufacturer's directions. Opaque cantaloupe
E15 0570 and transparent wood brown were used. No further firing. #PAPERWEIGHT#
E15 0580 (opposite page, top left): Red clay was used, rolled
E15 0590 1/2''
E15 0600 thick. Mold was used as pattern and clay cut by holding knife
E15 0610 at about 45` angle, to form an undercut, making base smaller than the
E15 0620 pattern top. While clay is still pressed in mold, press three equally
E15 0630 spaced holes 1/4'' deep, using pencil eraser, in bottom of clay
E15 0640 to allow for proper drying and firing. Paperweight may be personalized
E15 0650 on back while clay is leather hard. Bisque fired to cone 05. Unglazed.
E15 0651 #JARS WITH LIDS#
E15 0660 (opposite page, top left): Remove wooden
E15 0670 design head from bowl of butter mold. Fill small hole in bowl with clay.
E15 0680 Make paper patterns for sections of jar and lid (see Fig& 1,
E15 0681 opposite page). Measurements
E15 0690 for rectangular pattern piece ~A are obtained
E15 0700 by measuring inside circumference and depth of butter mold bowl.
E15 0710 Pattern for circular base piece ~B is diameter of ~A. Use wooden
E15 0720 design head of mold for pattern ~C; pattern ~D for lid fits
E15 0730 over top diameter of ~A. Pattern for inner lid piece ~E fits
E15 0740 inside ~A. Jars are assembled in bowl of butter mold.   Use
E15 0750 white or buff clay, rolled to 3/16'' thickness. Place patterns
E15 0760 on rolled clay and cut around them with knife in vertical position. Place
E15 0770 clay pieces on wall board.   To assemble jar, put paper pattern
E15 0780 ~B for base in bottom of mold and clay disk ~B on top. Line
E15 0790 sides of mold with paper pattern ~A. Bevel and score ends of clay
E15 0800 piece ~A so that they overlap about 1/2'' and make even thickness.
E15 0810 Place clay piece ~A inside; use slip to join overlapped ends
E15 0820 together. Join ~B to bottom of ~A, scoring and reinforcing with
E15 0830 clay coil. Trim excess clay from around lip of mold and set aside
E15 0840 while assembling lid.   To assemble lid, press clay piece ~C
E15 0850 in cavity of wooden design head. Press clay into mold as instructed
E15 0860 in General Directions. Score plain side of ~C and leave in mold.
E15 0870 Score one side of disk ~D, join to ~C; score other side of ~D
E15 0880 and one side of disk ~E and join as before. While assembled lid
E15 0890 is still on design head, gently but firmly press it on plaster board.
E15 0891 If design head has a
E15 0900 deep cavity, clay lid will be quite thick at this
E15 0910 point; press eraser of pencil gently 1/4'' deep into deep clay
E15 0920 to allow vent for proper drying and firing. Check fit of lid on jar;
E15 0930 if inner lid is too big, trim to fit, allowing room for thickness
E15 0940 of glaze. Remove lid from head of mold. Remove jar from mold. Place
E15 0950 jar on plaster board with lid in place to dry slowly. Bisque fire to
E15 0960 cone 08 with lid on jar.   For an antique effect on jars, brush
E15 0970 Creek-Turn brown toner on bisque ware and sponge it off. Glaze with
E15 0980 two coats of clear or transparent matt glaze. The large jar was brushed
E15 0990 with Creek-Turn green toner and sponged off. Glaze with two coats
E15 1000 of matt glazes in turquoise with touches of blossom pink on lid. When
E15 1010 dry they were fired to cone 06-05. #LITTLE FOLKS SET:# (Made
E15 1020 from modern wooden molds **f.)
E15 1030 Roll white clay to 3/16'' thickness.
E15 1040 _SALT AND PEPPER:_ Use mold to cut four side pieces. For
E15 1050 top and bottom pieces, use short end of mold as measurement guide. Press
E15 1060 the side pieces of clay into cavity of mold. Trim excess clay from
E15 1070 rim
E15 1080 of mold. Cut beveled edge on the long sides of clay at a 45` angle
E15 1090 to miter corners. Score beveled edges and remove pieces from mold;
E15 1100 place design-side up on plaster board. Make all four sides. Cut clay
E15 1110 top and base pieces; place on plaster board. Allow all pieces to
E15 1120 become leather hard before constructing shaker. _TO ASSEMBLE:_
E15 1130 Construct sides, bottom and top as for box, using slip on scored edges
E15 1140 and coils of clay to reinforce seams. Join the four sides together
E15 1150 first, then add the base; add top last. Use water on finger to smooth
E15 1160 seams and edges. Turn shaker upside down. Recess base slightly to
E15 1170 allow room for stopper. Cut hole in base for cork stopper. Add holes
E15 1180 in top, forming "~S" for salt and "~P" for pepper. Set
E15 1190 aside to dry thoroughly. _SUGAR AND CREAMER:_ Cut a strip of
E15 1200 clay for sides long enough and wide enough for three impressions of mold
E15 1210 design. Press clay into cavity of one mold three times; bevel overlapping
E15 1220 ends for splice joint, score beveled edges. Form clay strip
E15 1230 into a cylinder; use slip to join scored ends. Place cylinder on
E15 1240 a disk of clay slightly larger than cylinder. Score bottom edge of cylinder
E15 1250 and join to disk with slip. Trim away excess clay; reinforce
E15 1260 seam with a coil of clay. This will form the sugar bowl. Make creamer
E15 1270 the same.   Handle for creamer is a strip of clay 1/2'' wide
E15 1280 and 3-1/2'' long. To add handle, place a wooden dowel against
E15 1290 the inside wall of creamer. Score outside of container where handle
E15 1300 ends will be joined. Bend
E15 1310 handle; press scored handle ends firmly in
E15 1320 place using dowel to reinforce container while pressing; use slip to
E15 1330 join. To form spout, between two designs, dampen area slightly and
E15 1340 gently push clay outward. Make lid for sugar bowl the same as jar lids,
E15 1341 omitting design disk. Cut a
E15 1350 notch in lid for spoon handle if desired.
E15 1360 Set aside to dry with lid on sugar bowl. _VASES:_ Make same
E15 1370 as salt and pepper shakers, leaving off top pieces. Vases may be made
E15 1380 into candles by filling with melted wax and a wick. _NAPKIN HOLDER:_
E15 1390 Cut a piece of clay for base and two for sides each about **f (long
E15 1400 enough for three impressions of mold). Press the two sides into
E15 1410 cavity of one mold three times. Put cut pieces on plaster board to dry
E15 1420 to firm leather-hard state. Score side edges of base; join sides
E15 1430 and base with slip and reinforce with coil. A cardboard pattern cut to
E15 1440 fit inside holder will help to prevent warping. Place pattern inside
E15 1450 holder; use three strips of clay to hold in place (see Fig&
E15 1460 2, page 71). Do not use wood as it will not shrink with the clay and
E15 1470 would cause breakage.   Let all projects dry slowly for several
E15 1480 days. Clean greenware. Bisque fire to cone 08. Inside of pieces
E15 1490 was glazed with three coats of Creek-Turn bottle green antique glaze.
E15 1500 Outside was finished with Creek-Turn brown toner brushed on and sponged
E15 1510 off to give antique finish. Fired to cone 06-05.
E15 1520 #CHANGING COLORS# _TO CHANGE FROM ONE COLOR YARN TO ANOTHER:_
E15 1530 When changing from one color to another, whether working on right or
E15 1540 wrong side, pick up the new strand from underneath dropped strand. Photograph
E15 1550 shows the wrong side of work with light strand being picked
E15 1560 up under dark strand in position to be purled. _TO MEASURE WORK:_
E15 1570 Spread article on flat surface to required width before measuring
E15 1580 length at center. #MEASURING ARMHOLE# _TO MEASURE ARMHOLE:_
E15 1585 Mark row on which first stitches
E15 1590 have been bound off for armhole by drawing
E15 1600 a contrasting colored thread through it. Place work on a flat surface
E15 1610 and smooth out. Measure straight up from marked row. See illustration.
E15 1620 _TO INSERT MARKERS:_ When directions read "~sl a
E15 1630 marker on needle", put a small safety pin, paper clip, or commercial
E15 1640 ring marker on needle. In working, always slip marker from one needle
E15 1650 to another. To mark a row or stitch, tie contrasting thread around
E15 1651 end
E15 1660 of row or stitch to be marked. #BACKSTITCHING SEAM# _TO SEW SEAMS
E15 1670 WITH BACKSTITCH:_ Most seams are sewn with backstitch, especially
E15 1680 on curved, slanted or loose edges. Pin right sides of pieces together,
E15 1690 keeping edges even and matching rows or patterns. Thread matching
E15 1700 yarn in tapestry needle. Run end of yarn through several stitches
E15 1710 along edge to secure; backstitch pieces together close to edge. Do
E15 1720 not draw yarn too tight. See illustration. _TO SEW IN SLEEVES:_
E15 1730 Place sleeve seam at center underarm and center of sleeve cap at shoulder
E15 1740 seam. Ease in any extra fullness evenly around. Backstitch seam.
E15 1750 #WEAVING SEAM# _TO WEAVE SEAMS TOGETHER:_ Straight vertical
E15 1760 edges, such as those at the back seam of a sock, can be woven together
E15 1770 invisibly. Thread matching yarn in tapestry needle. Hold edges
E15 1780 together, right side up.
E16 0010    HOTEI is 23 feet long with an 8-1/2-foot beam and every inch
E16 0020 a family boat. Menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the
E16 0030 helmsman has a clear view. Youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves
E16 0040 safely in the large cabin which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom, bunks for
E16 0050 three, galley and marine toilet. The gals can sun themselves in the
E16 0060 roomy aft cockpit. All are well distributed, not crowded together near
E16 0070 the stern. And with passenger weight shifted forward, Hotei levels
E16 0080 off for speed under power of a Merc 800. The 80-~hp motor drives
E16 0090 her at 25 ~mph with six aboard!   With only two aboard, Hotei
E16 0091 does better than 27
E16 0100 ~mph- and she gives a comfortable ride at this
E16 0110 speed even in a three-foot chop. She also banks into a turn like
E16 0120 a fine runabout- not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all
E16 0130 over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser. Nor is she a wet boat.
E16 0131 We've been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry.
E16 0140    {A lot of
E16 0150 thought} went into storage space construction. There's a large compartment
E16 0160 in the forward cockpit for charts and other items. The cabin
E16 0170 has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for
E16 0171 water skiis, life jackets, etc&.
E16 0180 The aft cockpit has a **f storage bin
E16 0190 over six feet long that doubles as a seat. On each side of the motor
E16 0200 well there's storage for battery, bumpers, line and spare props with
E16 0210 six-gallon gas tanks below. The well itself is designed to take two
E16 0220 Merc 800's or 500's if you wish and there's room for a 25-gallon
E16 0230 long-cruise gas tank below it.   Needless to say, you can't
E16 0240 build Hotei in a couple of weeks. Our building time was slightly
E16 0250 over 400 hours- but the total cost for the hull with Fiberglas bottom,
E16 0260 sink, head and hardware was under $800. A comparable manufactured
E16 0270 boat would cost close to $3,000. Consider what you have to earn to be
E16 0280 able to spend the $3,000 and your building time is well worth it. A
E16 0290 Gator trailer, Model 565, is used to transport the boat to the waterways.
E16 0300 This piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save
E16 0310 you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years.   All framing
E16 0320 in Hotei is one-inch mahogany which, in the dressed state you
E16 0330 buy it, is about the 13/16-inch thickness specified in the drawings. Therefore,
E16 0340 the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens,
E16 0350 etc&, on a table saw. Besides flathead bronze screws, silicon bronze
E16 0360 Stronghold nails (made by Independent Nail + Packing Co&,
E16 0370 Bridgewater, Mass&) are used extensively in assembly and Weldwood
E16 0380 resorcinal glue is used in all the joints.   {Construction}
E16 0390 follows a thorough study of the drawings. Start by laying out the six
E16 0400 frames and the transom on a level floor. Draw each outline in a different-color
E16 0410 chalk, one on top of the other. In this way you will be
E16 0420 able to detect any obvious mistakes.   The transom frame is made
E16 0430 first with the joints lapped, glued and fastened with one-inch, No&
E16 0440 12 Stronghold nails. After notching it for the keelson, chines and
E16 0441 battens, the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue
E16 0450 and the same type
E16 0460 nails. All frames are butted at the joints and 3/8-inch plywood gussets
E16 0470 are glued and nailed on each side of each joint, again using the one-inch,
E16 0480 No& 12 nails. The frames are notched only for the keelson
E16 0490 and the chines. If notched for the battens, they would require more work,
E16 0500 be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge
E16 0510 water could flow through. Nowhere in the boat do the frames come in
E16 0520 contact with the plywood planking.   The jig is erected after the
E16 0530 frames and transom are complete. This is an important step because
E16 0540 any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull
E16 0550 as you advance in construction. Be sure all members are parallel,
E16 0560 vertical and level as required.   After the frames and transom
E16 0570 are set up on the jig and temporarily braced, a piece of three-inch-wide
E16 0580 mahogany (only widths will be given since the 13/16-inch thickness
E16 0590 is used throughout) is butted between frames one and two below the line
E16 0600 of the keelson. The frames are glued and screwed to this piece. The
E16 0610 joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated
E16 0620 Fiberglas cloth and nailed. It is over this piece that the
E16 0630 laminated stem and keelson are spliced.   The keelson, made of
E16 0640 two three-inch widths, is next installed. The first piece is glued
E16 0650 and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames
E16 0660 one and two. The second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the
E16 0670 first. Note, however, that it is six inches shorter at the forward end.
E16 0680 One-inch, No& 10 screws are used in both cases.   {A stem
E16 0690 jig} is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to
E16 0700 frame one. The stem is laminated from four pieces. Take two three-inch-wide
E16 0710 pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make
E16 0720 the four. Then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and
E16 0730 bend them into place on the jig. The first two pieces butt against
E16 0740 the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace
E16 0750 between the first two frames. The second two pieces lap over the inner
E16 0760 member of the keelson and butt against the outer member. They're
E16 0770 glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson. A number of ~C
E16 0780 clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets.
E16 0790    All bottom battens are two inches wide. The side ones are a half-inch
E16 0800 narrower. The battens are carefully fastened in place after some
E16 0810 necessary fairing on all frames. Glue and 1-1/2-inch, No& 10 screws
E16 0820 are used. Placement is important because the rear seat, bunks and
E16 0830 front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens.
E16 0840 With the exception of two battens, all run to the stem where they
E16 0850 are glued and screwed after careful beveling. The chines go in the same
E16 0860 way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength
E16 0870 and easier bending.   Fairing is always a tedious job but
E16 0880 the work can be cut down considerably with a Skill planer and a simple
E16 0890 jig. I clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer
E16 0900 with a pair of Sure Grips. The aluminum, flush against the battens,
E16 0910 acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson
E16 0920 to the proper bevels easily. If you don't own a planer and don't
E16 0930 want to buy one, it's well worth renting.   {The planking}
E16 0940 is five-ply, 3/8-inch-thick Weldwood Royal Marine plywood. This
E16 0950 can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long. The 42-inch width
E16 0960 leaves very little waste. Four pieces are used. Plank the sides first,
E16 0970 using glue and one-inch, No& 12 Stronghold nails at all battens,
E16 0980 the stem and the transom. Another person inside with a weight against
E16 0990 each batten will help in the fastening. The best procedure is to
E16 1000 have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off.
E16 1010 Then trim the excess. I used a Homemaster Routo-Jig made by Porter
E16 1020 Cable for this job. It's good for cutting all the planking because
E16 1030 it cuts with a bit-like blade at high ~rpm and does not chatter
E16 1040 the plywood like a saber saw.   When cut, the planking is clamped
E16 1050 in place for a final and careful trimming. Then it is marked on the
E16 1060 inside where it comes in contact with the transom, frames, keelson and
E16 1070 all the battens. It may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings. The
E16 1080 next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at
E16 1090 the contact points. Then it is replaced and fastened. The bottom planking
E16 1100 is applied in the same manner.   After planking, the bottom
E16 1110 gets a layer of Fiberglas. The spray rails are first glued on the
E16 1120 outside and fastened from the inside with screws. Then the chines are
E16 1130 rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation. Since the
E16 1140 sides are also covered up to the spray rails, they are also rough-sanded
E16 1150 in that area. The cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at
E16 1160 a time. A 50-inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line
E16 1170 by about three inches. Lay the cloth in place and trim it to size.
E16 1180 Then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin. When the resin
E16 1190 has hardened, mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish.
E16 1200 I used bright red, mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding
E16 1210 the hardener. Using a cheap brush, coat one side of the bottom with
E16 1220 the resin and then apply the cloth. When the cloth is smooth, apply
E16 1230 another coat of resin, spreading it with a paint roller. Be sure it is
E16 1240 well saturated and then allow it to harden.   When the whole bottom
E16 1250 has hardened, use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth
E16 1260 at the keel line and near the spray rail. Then lay a three-inch-wide
E16 1270 strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of
E16 1280 the stem. Before the resin has hardened, screw a one-inch mahogany keel
E16 1290 strip along the centerline. This protects the bottom in beaching.
E16 1300 Fiberglas materials are available from Glass Plastic Supply Co&,
E16 1310 1605 W& Elizabeth ave&, Linden, N& J&. They will also
E16 1320 supply literature on application.   {The hull} is now turned
E16 1330 over (with the help of about seven friends) and placed in a level, well-braced
E16 1340 position. I set it on the Gator trailer. I laid three layers
E16 1350 of glass cloth on the inside of the stem, also installing a bow eye
E16 1360 at this time. For added strength, I also fastened a small block on
E16 1370 each side of every frame and batten joint. Again, these blocks were
E16 1380 set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed.   After trimming
E16 1390 off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them
E16 1400 to the jig at a working height, the top of the side planking is installed.
E16 1410 This is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom.
E16 1420 These flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry. When they're
E16 1430 on, the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten.   The
E16 1440 sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from
E16 1450 frame six to the transom, forming a real strong transom brace. Note
E16 1460 another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between
E16 1470 these pieces.   The decking is quarter-inch mahogany marine
E16 1480 plywood. All the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior
E16 1490 fir plywood. Most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring.
E16 1500 The exception is where the flooring butts. These battens are glued
E16 1510 and screwed to the frames.   With all deck battens in place, the
E16 1520 bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line. Use one coat of
E16 1530 Firzite and one coat of marine paint. Bottoms of the floorboards are
E16 1540 also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place.   After
E16 1550 the decking is on, the cabin sides are installed. They're followed
E16 1560 by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated. The windshield glass
E16 1570 is shatterproof and Plexiglas is used in the cabin.   {Inside},
E16 1580 bunks are framed up and installed as indicated. A head is a handy
E16 1590 thing to have and I installed one under a removable section of the
E16 1600 port bunk. The sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into
E16 1610 the head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above
E16 1620 the sink. For padding the seats and bunks, I used Ensolite, Type
E16 1621 ~M.
E16 1630 Lightweight, non-absorbent, fire resistant and dimensionally stable,
E16 1640 it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement. Available
E16 1650 in **f sheets, it costs about a dollar a square foot.
E17 0010 <You can build this vacation cottage yourself. It is a full scale,
E17 0015 small,
E17 0020 but efficient house that can become a year 'round retreat complete
E17 0030 in every detail. Because of the unique design by the architect Egils
E17 0040 Hermanovski, you can build most of it in your own home workshop
E17 0050 in your spare time. Most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials,
E17 0060 and requires the use of only simple tools. On the following
E17 0070 pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to
E17 0080 your vacation cottage, from choosing the proper site to applying the
E17 0090 final trim>.
E17 0095    In recognition of the growing trend for second homes,
E17 0100 or vacation cottages, we have designed this one specifically with
E17 0110 the family handyman in mind. It is a big project, not to be taken lightly.
E17 0120 But each step has been broken down into easy stages, utilizing
E17 0130 standard materials and simple tools, well within the capabilities of the
E17 0140 handyman. #THE THEORY# The idea behind our design is modular units,
E17 0150 or panelization. Everything possible has been scaled to standard
E17 0160 sizes and measurements of materials. Wall panels and structural timbers
E17 0170 are standard as are windows and doors, making for a minimum of cutting.
E17 0180 We have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so
E17 0190 that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop,
E17 0200 panel by panel, according to plan. Thus, when you have prepared your
E17 0210 foundation and laid the floor, these can be trucked to the site and erected
E17 0220 with a small crew of friends in a weekend. The roof timbers are
E17 0230 precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed
E17 0240 in a matter of three or four days. Then you can do the finishing
E17 0250 touches at your leisure. #A WARNING# Due to the fact that building
E17 0260 codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country, the first
E17 0270 thing to do is to find out what, if any, they are. Close to a large
E17 0280 city they might even specify the size of the nails used; in a remote
E17 0290 section there might be no restrictions at all. This can usually
E17 0300 be found out at the nearest town hall. At the same time check the electrical,
E17 0310 plumbing, and sanitary requirements, as well as possible zoning
E17 0320 regulations. Whether electricity and public water and sewers are available
E17 0330 or not, check the local customs in the use of bottled or ~L-P
E17 0340 gas (we give you alternatives later on). Be sure that this information
E17 0350 is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion. If there
E17 0360 are any major restrictions, they usually can be obtained in printed
E17 0370 form. Where a building permit is required, find out what you must
E17 0380 present when applying for one. In many cases, you must file a complete
E17 0390 set of plans with the local building inspector. These will be available
E17 0400 at cost from our Plans Department. #THE SITE# Some general
E17 0410 things to look for in a site, if you haven't already bought one, are
E17 0420 accessibility, water drainage, and orientation. How are the roads,
E17 0430 and how will they stand up? Is there evidence of wash-outs on the property;
E17 0440 swampy areas or intermittent springs? A visit in the early
E17 0450 spring after a thaw will be very informative. Note where the sun rises
E17 0460 and sets, and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms
E17 0470 come from. Will the view be something you can live with? Don't
E17 0480 worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain; we will take up alternative
E17 0490 foundations later on. #THE MATERIALS# With this first issue
E17 0500 we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic (~A
E17 0510 version) and the expandable (~B version). This will be <for the
E17 0520 shell of the house only> (roof, walls, and floor), and does not include
E17 0530 the carport or balcony. This will permit you to get a <rough>
E17 0540 estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost. Bear in mind
E17 0550 that this does <not> include interior panels for partitions, fancy
E17 0560 flooring, appliances and fixtures, electrical wiring, and plumbing,
E17 0570 all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues.   The
E17 0580 wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard **f and **f of
E17 0590 a good grade, free from structural faults. They should be as straight
E17 0600 as possible, as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when
E17 0610 the walls are erected. The outside surface of the solid units shall
E17 0620 be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood, plastic coated
E17 0630 panel board, high density particle board, asbestos-cement board, or
E17 0640 any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building
E17 0650 supply dealer. The inner panels do not have to be weatherproof, and
E17 0660 the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired. All panel
E17 0670 board comes in standard **f foot size. It is recommended that panels
E17 0680 be both glued as well as nailed to the frame. The fixed window panels
E17 0690 with louvers should have a good grade of 1/8-inch double-strength glass
E17 0700 set in a mastic glazing compound. The louvers are constructed as
E17 0710 shown in the detail, with a drop door for ventilation. There are standard
E17 0720 sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels
E17 0730 requiring them. The door panels are designed to accommodate standard
E17 0740 doors which should be of exterior grade. The filler panels for the gable
E17 0750 ends are cut from full **f sheets as shown, leaving no wastage. The
E17 0760 battens covering the joints are of **f stock and are applied after
E17 0770 the walls are erected. All nails should be rustproof, and aluminum is
E17 0780 highly recommended. Note: If 1/2-inch panel board is used inside
E17 0790 and out, or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the other, and 1/8-inch glass
E17 0800 is used, stock lumber in **f, **f, and **f can be used in making the
E17 0810 glass panels. Other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special
E17 0820 size lumber for the glass trim. In any case, there is no special milling
E17 0830 or rabbeting required for the panels.
E17 0840    With modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting
E17 0850 tools, fixtures, and attachments available, the drill press has become
E17 0860 a basic home workshop tool. The drill press consists of a vertical
E17 0870 shaft (spindle) which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a
E17 0880 drill chuck, a tubular housing (quill) in which the spindle is mounted,
E17 0890 a head in which the quill is mounted, a feed lever which moves the
E17 0900 quill up or down, a power source, and a movable table upon which the work
E17 0910 is placed. There is often a means of locking the quill and, on larger
E17 0920 presses, the table can be tilted.   The size of the press is
E17 0930 usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity (the maximum diameter tool
E17 0940 shank it will hold) or distance between the spindle center and the
E17 0950 column. A press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center
E17 0960 of a 22 inch board or circle.   A new radial drill press with
E17 0970 a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done
E17 0980 at any angle. The head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on
E17 0990 the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work.
E17 1000 #SET-UP AND MAINTENANCE# The drill press should be leveled and, depending
E17 1010 on whether it is a bench or floor model, bolted securely to a
E17 1020 sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws.
E17 1030 This will reduce vibration and increase accuracy.   A coat
E17 1040 of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the
E17 1050 polished surface of the table; wiping with a slightly oiled cloth
E17 1060 will discourage rusting of the column and quill. Presses not fitted
E17 1070 with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in
E17 1080 the lubrication holes in the quill. The rest of the press should be kept
E17 1090 clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush.   Be careful to
E17 1100 keep the drive belt free of oil and grease. Belt tension is adjusted
E17 1110 by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount. Keep
E17 1120 the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won't slip when pulled by
E17 1130 hand; excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle
E17 1140 bearings. Most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises
E17 1150 the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds
E17 1160 the quill in the raised position. The return spring tension may be
E17 1170 adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing
E17 1180 with a pair of pliers (to prevent the spring from unwinding when it
E17 1190 is released), loosening the lock nut or screw, and rotating the housing
E17 1200 until the desired tension is achieved. Turning the housing clockwise
E17 1210 will reduce tension, counter-clockwise will increase it. #DON'T
E17 1220 LOSE THE CHUCK KEY# Some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide
E17 1230 a socket for the chuck key; otherwise, you'll have to spend
E17 1240 a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the
E17 1250 press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the
E17 1260 bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not
E17 1270 in use. #FEEDS AND SPEEDS# Drill speeds are important if you want
E17 1280 a good job. Each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed,
E17 1290 depending on the material worked. On most drill presses, it is impossible
E17 1300 to get the exact speed, but you can come close by adjusting the
E17 1310 drive belt on the step-cone pulleys. You will find a chart giving the
E17 1320 various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere
E17 1330 in the instruction booklet that came with the tool. See the table
E17 1340 on page 34 for exact recommended speeds. Generally, the larger the
E17 1350 tool and the harder the material, the slower the speed.   Feed pressure
E17 1360 is also of major importance. Too much pressure will force the
E17 1370 tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed
E17 1380 or broken tools. Too light a feed, particularly with metal or other hard
E17 1390 material, causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting
E17 1400 edge. The best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed
E17 1410 with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even
E17 1420 rate. #COMMON DRILLING TOOLS# There are numerous types and styles
E17 1430 of tools to drill holes. The most common are the twist drill, the
E17 1440 solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades, the double spur
E17 1450 bit, and the power wood bit. All will do a good job if sharp, but the
E17 1460 twist drills don't cut quite as smoothly as the others, since they
E17 1470 do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual
E17 1480 boring starts.   The adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting
E17 1490 large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by
E17 1500 reversing the cutter blade. Since fly cutters are one sided and not
E17 1510 balanced, they should be used at the slowest speed available, and fed
E17 1520 very slowly to avoid binding. Fly cutters can fool you into putting
E17 1530 your hand too close to the tool, so if you want to avoid nicked fingers,
E17 1540 keep your hands well out of the way. #SIMPLE HOLE DRILLING OPERATIONS#
E17 1550 When drilling all the way through a workpiece, always place a
E17 1560 piece of scrap wood underneath. This will not only protect the work
E17 1570 table, but also assure a clean breakthrough. Another method of assuring
E17 1580 a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through,
E17 1590 then drill half way with the dimensional bit, turn the piece over,
E17 1600 and finish from the other side. In soft woods with pronounced grain,
E17 1610 there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander, due to the varying
E17 1620 hardness of the wood. In this case, drilling a small pilot hole or
E17 1630 clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy.   When a hole
E17 1640 is to be bored to a predetermined depth, mark the depth on the side
E17 1650 of the stock, then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark.
E17 1660 The depth gauge rod can now be set, and any number of holes bored to
E17 1670 exact and identical depth.
E18 0010    The old-time bridges over the Merrimac River in Massachusetts
E18 0020 are of unusual interest in many respects. For their length, their
E18 0030 types of construction, their picturesque settings, and their literary
E18 0040 associations, they should be known and remembered. In this sequence
E18 0050 I shall write about them in the order of their erection.   The
E18 0060 first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part,- and perhaps
E18 0070 the most interesting one, connected Newbury (now Newburyport) with
E18 0080 Salisbury Point. Its building was first proposed in 1791, when a
E18 0090 group of citizens, mostly Newburyport men, petitioned the General Court
E18 0100 for an act of incorporation. This document began: _"NO&
E18 0110 1 NEWBURY PORT, MAY 30TH, 1791_   "Whereas, a Bridge over
E18 0120 Merrimack River, from the Land of Hon'ble Jonathan Greenleaf,
E18 0130 Esquire, in Newbery, to Deer Island, and from said Island to Salisbury,
E18 0140 would be of very extensive utility, by affording a safe Conveyance
E18 0141 to Carriages, Teams
E18 0150 and Travellers at all seasons of the year,
E18 0160 and at all Times of Tide.   "We, the Subscribers, do agree,
E18 0170 that as soon as a convenient Number of Persons have subscribed to
E18 0180 this, or a similar Writing, We will present a petition to the Hon'ble
E18 0190 General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, praying
E18 0200 for an Act incorporating into a Body politic the subscribers to such
E18 0210 Writing with Liberty to build such a Bridge, and a Right to demand
E18 0220 a Toll equal to that received at Malden Bridge, and on like Terms,
E18 0230 and if such an Act shall be obtained, then we severally agree each
E18 0240 with the others, that we will hold in the said Bridge the several shares
E18 0250 set against our respective Names, the whole into two hundred shares
E18 0260 being divided, and that we will pay such sums of Money at such Times
E18 0270 and in such Manners, as by the said proposed Corporation, shall
E18 0280 be directed and required".   This paper was signed by forty-five
E18 0290 persons, subscribing a total of two hundred shares.   A month
E18 0300 later the General Court served notice to the town of Newbury that
E18 0310 the bridge was to be built. The matter was considered and reconsidered,
E18 0320 and finally opposed, but in spite of many objections, the Court
E18 0330 granted a charter on January 9, 1792. On November 26 of that year the
E18 0340 bridge was completed and opened.   Timothy Palmer, who invented
E18 0350 and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges,
E18 0360 was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the Essex,
E18 0370 or "Deer Island" bridge although the actual work was carried
E18 0380 out under the direction of William Coombs, who received @ 300 as
E18 0385 recompense.
E18 0390    This two-part bridge is best described by Rev& Timothy
E18 0400 Dwight, president of Yale College, in his "Travels in New-England
E18 0410 and New-York", published in New Haven in 1821. He says
E18 0420 of it:   "It consists of two divisions, separated by an island
E18 0430 at a small distance from the southern shore. The division between
E18 0440 the island and this shore, consists principally of an arch; whose
E18 0450 chord is one hundred and sixty feet, and whose vortex is forty feet (it
E18 0460 was actually 37 feet) above the high-water mark. In appearance and
E18 0470 construction it resembles the Pascataqua bridge. The whole length of
E18 0480 Essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four.
E18 0490 I have already mentioned that Mr& Timothy Palmer of Newburyport
E18 0500 was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country. As Mr&
E18 0510 Palmer was educated to house-building only, and had never seen a
E18 0520 structure of this nature; he certainly deserves not a little credit
E18 0530 for the invention".   It is hardly necessary to remind students
E18 0540 of covered bridges that Timothy Palmer was born in 1751 in nearby
E18 0550 Rowley; that he moved with his parents to West Boxford when he was
E18 0560 sixteen years old; and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect,
E18 0570 Moody Spofford. It was indeed a remarkable feat that a man
E18 0580 who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the
E18 0590 principle of the arch, which appears in his famous bridges at Portsmouth,
E18 0600 Haverhill, and Philadelphia.   The Essex Merrimack Bridge
E18 0610 when first built was not covered. As far as we know, no American
E18 0620 bridge had been thus protected in 1792. Richard S& Allen is the
E18 0630 authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed
E18 0640 by 1810. Its original appearance is shown in an engraving published
E18 0650 in the "Massachusetts Magazine" in May 1793, which is reproduced
E18 0660 herewith (Fig& 1). A brief description accompanying the picture
E18 0670 says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber. Between
E18 0680 the abutments on the Newbury shore and the south bank of Deer Island
E18 0690 there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet; between the north
E18 0700 shore of Deer Island and the Salisbury side there was an arch of
E18 0710 113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long.   A
E18 0720 dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place
E18 0730 July 4, 1793, in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island.
E18 0740 It is said that the eccentric Timothy Dexter, who was one of the
E18 0750 first share-holders, stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the
E18 0760 occasion. The "Essex Journal" says that he "delivered an oration
E18 0770 on the bridge, which for elegance of style, propriety of speech
E18 0780 or force of argument, was truly Ciceronian". The reporter must have
E18 0790 written this with tongue in cheek, because Dexter's oration could
E18 0800 hardly be understood; and, although he later explained that he was
E18 0810 talking French, it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to
E18 0820 the joys of the evening.   The north portion of the Essex bridge
E18 0830 was well worth the cost of construction, although it proved to be twice
E18 0840 what was estimated in the beginning. It stood in its original form
E18 0850 until 1882. The southern half, however, on account of its underbracing,
E18 0860 was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation. In 1810 it
E18 0870 was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge. This was built
E18 0880 by John Templeman from plans submitted by James Finley of Fayette
E18 0890 County, Pennsylvania. Timothy Palmer had general supervision
E18 0900 of the work.   An advertisement in the "Newburyport Herald",
E18 0910 December 21, 1810, shows Palmer in a new light as an expert on chain
E18 0920 bridges. It reads: _"CHAIN BRIDGES_   "Information
E18 0930 is hereby given that Mr& Timothy Palmer of Newburyport, Mass&
E18 0940 has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the Patentees of the
E18 0950 Chain Bridge, in the states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont,
E18 0960 Rhode Island, and Connecticut, so far as relates to the sale
E18 0970 of Patent rights and the construction of Chain Bridges.   "Mr&
E18 0980 Palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if
E18 0990 desired will view the proposed site, and lay out and superintend the
E18 1000 work, or recommend a suitable person to execute it.   John
E18 1010 Templeman
E18 1020    "Approved, Timothy Palmer"   This chain bridge proved
E18 1030 less durable than the wooden arch on the Salisbury end. It fell,
E18 1040 February 6, 1827, carrying with it a horse and wagon, two men and four
E18 1050 oxen. The horse and men were saved, but the oxen drowned. In spite
E18 1060 of this catastrophe, the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened
E18 1070 again on July 17, 1827. This second chain bridge was 570 feet long,
E18 1080 had two thirty-foot towers and a draw, and a double roadway.
E18 1090    The Essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868, when the County
E18 1100 Commissioners laid out all the Merrimack bridges as highways.
E18 1110    Sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous
E18 1120 use, the old covered, wooden bridge that spans the Tygartis Valley River
E18 1130 at Philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance
E18 1140 of the first land battle of the Civil War at its home site, May
E18 1150 28th to June 3rd. Colonel Frederick W& Lander, impersonated,
E18 1160 will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of Talbott's
E18 1170 (now College) Hill and thunder across the bridge to join Colonel
E18 1180 Benjamin F& Kelley's (West) Virginia Infantry, then swarming
E18 1190 through the streets in pursuit of the retreating Confederates.
E18 1200 He was closely followed by the Ohio and Indiana troops- thus the
E18 1210 old bridge has another distinction; that of being the first such structure
E18 1220 secured by force of arms in the war of the '60s.   The
E18 1230 bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements, war, fire,
E18 1240 and floods, as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic, for more than
E18 1250 a hundred years. Twice during the Civil War it was saved from destruction
E18 1260 by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister.
E18 1270 It still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the
E18 1280 last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic
E18 1290 on U&S& Route 250- the old Beverly and Fairmont Turnpike.
E18 1300 It is one of the very few, if not the only surviving bridge of
E18 1310 its type to serve a main artery of the U&S& highway system, thus
E18 1320 it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days.   This
E18 1330 covered, wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action
E18 1340 in the early morning of June 3, 1861, and with subsequent troop movements
E18 1350 of both armies in the Philippi area that it has become a part
E18 1360 and parcel of the war story. So frequently has pictures of the bridge
E18 1370 appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the
E18 1380 old John Brown Fort at Harpers Ferry as the two nationally best known
E18 1390 structures in West Virginia.   Completed and opened for traffic
E18 1400 in 1852, the bridge was designed and built by Lemuel Chenoweth
E18 1410 and his brother, Eli, of Beverly. The Chenoweth brothers were experienced
E18 1420 bridge builders, and against the competition of other, and better
E18 1430 known, bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of
E18 1440 the covered, wooden bridges on the Parkersburg and Staunton Turnpike
E18 1450 a dozen years before, as well as many other bridges for several counties.
E18 1460 The Philippi bridge, however, was the Chenoweth master piece,
E18 1470 with its 139-foot, dual lane, span- and it stands today as a monument
E18 1480 to its builders. Never rebuilt, the bridge was strengtened in 1938
E18 1490 by two extra piers, a concrete floor, and a walk-way along the upper
E18 1500 side in order to care for modern traffic.   During the war it
E18 1510 was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the
E18 1520 railhead at Grafton to the troops operating in the interior. Union
E18 1530 soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the
E18 1540 rain or other inclement weather, and some of them left momentoes of their
E18 1550 stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams.
E18 1560    But what the elements could not do was seriously threatened
E18 1570 when Brigadier General William E& (Grumble) Jones reached Philippi
E18 1580 while on the famous Jones-Imboden raid in May, 1863. General
E18 1590 Jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings, including the
E18 1600 long bridge at Fairmont, and, after seeing a great drove of horses
E18 1610 and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge, he sent his men
E18 1620 to work piling combustibles in and around it. Reverend Joshual Corder,
E18 1630 a Baptist minister, gathered a few citizens of Southern sympathies,
E18 1640 to call on Jones and plead with him to spare the structure; he
E18 1650 reasoned and argued, pointing out that Jones or other Confederate
E18 1660 commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat. Jones
E18 1670 relented, he did not order his men to apply the torch- the drove of
E18 1680 livestock was driven up the valley, via Beverly, and across the mountains
E18 1690 to feed and serve the Confederate army, while Jones and his raiders
E18 1700 turned toward Buckhannon to join forces with Imboden.
E18 1710 Again Reverend Corder saved the bridge when Union soldiers planned
E18 1720 to destroy it, after filling its two lanes with hay and straw- but
E18 1730 for what reason is not recorded nor remembered, certainly not because
E18 1740 of pressure from an opposing Confederate force. On the second occasion
E18 1750 it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their
E18 1760 purpose.   Centering around this historic old structure, a group
E18 1770 of public-spirited Barbour County citizens have organized and planned
E18 1780 a week-long series of events, beginning on May 28th and continuing
E18 1790 through June 3rd, to observe most appropriately the centennial of
E18 1800 the first land engagement of the Civil War at Philippi.
E19 0010    It is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming
E19 0020 pool- eight enlightening, vigorous, rigorous, not wholly unrewarding
E19 0030 years. We have learned a lot- a dash of hydrochemistry here, a
E19 0040 bit about plumbing and pump-priming there. We have had sound grounding
E19 0050 in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy.
E19 0060 We have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard
E19 0070 birds. True, our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of
E19 0080 our neighbors have built their own pools, thereby diluting our spectacular
E19 0090 attractions. But problems cling to pools, as any pool owner knows.
E19 0100 So our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials,
E19 0110 errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the
E19 0120 first time- in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience.
E19 0130 #WHERE TO PUT IT# Position may not be everything, but in the
E19 0140 case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties, social and/or
E19 0150 physical. We speak from varying viewpoints. One of us has a pool set
E19 0160 in a wooded area very near the house. The other has his pool far away
E19 0170 from the house in a field high on a hill.   If you are dreaming
E19 0180 of a blue, shimmering pool right outside your living room windows,
E19 0190 close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of
E19 0200 children, damp towels, squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated
E19 0210 plastic toys. You are likely to be nearer the truth.   You can
E19 0220 also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living
E19 0230 quarters, the greater the chance for violation of family privacy, annoying
E19 0240 noise and the let's-make-your-house-our-club attitude. On the
E19 0250 other hand, out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children
E19 0260 cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the
E19 0270 pool.   Another dilemma: As picturesque as a sylvan pond in
E19 0280 the forest may be, trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being
E19 0290 of a pool. Yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating
E19 0300 lawn every time the grass is mowed.   As in choosing a wife, it
E19 0310 is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be
E19 0320 in bad weather as well as in good. In the colder climes, for instance,
E19 0330 you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when
E19 0340 your pool will hardly look its best. It may be a big hole in the ground
E19 0350 filled with salt hay, or an ice floe studded with logs. Even a
E19 0360 neat, plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold. (We do,
E19 0370 however, recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk-
E19 0380 flora and fauna generally- from accidentally wintering in the
E19 0390 pool.)   Probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts.
E19 0400 Naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and
E19 0410 size of your land. But if space and money are no problem and small children
E19 0420 are not on hand every day, it is certainly more restful to have
E19 0430 your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs
E19 0440 of the house. And a good several feet around the pool should be neither
E19 0450 greensward nor woods, but good hard pavement.   The placement
E19 0460 of your pool, however, will not of itself solve the two major problems
E19 0470 of pool owning- those that involve your social life and those pertaining
E19 0480 to safety. Coping with them demands stern discipline- of yourself
E19 0490 as well as of your family, neighbors, friends and anyone you ever
E19 0500 talked to on a transoceanic jet.   Eight years ago while we were
E19 0510 going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period, we were
E19 0520 each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings
E19 0530 to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid
E19 0540 out nearby for the lord and master's delectation. But not even our
E19 0545 first pool-side
E19 0550 gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies.
E19 0560 We seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own
E19 0570 backyards. Our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled.
E19 0580 Had we taken a lien on a state park? Not at all. We had merely been
E19 0590 discovered by the pool sharks. We were in business!   From
E19 0600 proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step-
E19 0610 no more than the change from city clothes to trunks. Nai^ve of us,
E19 0620 maybe, but the results of our impulsive invitations to "come over
E19 0630 next summer and swim in our new pool" were both unexpected and unsettling.
E19 0640 #OUR BOOK OF ETIQUETTE# After the first few weeks, it was
E19 0650 obvious that rules had to be made, laid down and obeyed- even if our
E19 0660 popularity ratings became subnormal as a result. So rules we made,
E19 0670 in unabashed collusion. Since our viewpoints in this respect coincided
E19 0680 precisely, we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single
E19 0690 social code for pool owners.   First and foremost: No one-
E19 0700 no, not anyone- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations
E19 0710 to his or her own circle. Just short of forty lashes we finally managed
E19 0720 to coerce our children to this view. Their friends and ours are
E19 0730 welcome to share the pool, but on our terms and at our times.
E19 0740 No friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning
E19 0750 beforehand.   No ringers, either- even if they are trailing
E19 0760 legitimate invitees. We want to know when the Potlatches telephone
E19 0770 exactly how many they are planning to bring, so that we won't
E19 0780 end up with a splashing mob that looks like Coney Island in August.
E19 0790    No young children may come without adults except for a specific,
E19 0800 organized, chaperoned party. And accompanying adults are urged to
E19 0810 keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities. A gaggle
E19 0820 of gabbling mothers, backs to the pool, is no safeguard.   No bottle
E19 0830 pool is tolerated- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come
E19 0840 to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk
E19 0850 and run. (Sanity, solvency and relations with our wine merchant took
E19 0860 a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood
E19 0870 free-drink stop.)   We designated one day a week as the time
E19 0880 when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours. This has
E19 0890 saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less
E19 0900 brutal to the young "less fortunate" than ours.   We also
E19 0910 worked out logistics for Sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours
E19 0920 early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco
E19 0930 lunch <en famille>. We gently usher them to an island of tables
E19 0940 and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where
E19 0950 they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides.   All
E19 0960 dressing (undressing to be more exact) must be done in our small bath
E19 0970 house or at the swimmers' homes. (To avoid any possible excuse for
E19 0980 a dripping parade through your house, it is a good idea to have a telephone
E19 0990 extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between
E19 1000 the pool and the parking area.) We do, however, provide a limited
E19 1010 number of extra suits, mainly for children, and we stock extra towels
E19 1020 and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences. Life-preservers, the buckle-on
E19 1030 kapok-filled kind, are held in readiness, too, for the very young.
E19 1040 #PRESERVING LIFE AND LIMB# Safety rules, of course, are more
E19 1050 important than all the others put together.   In many localities,
E19 1060 now, the law requires all pools to be fenced, usually to a minimum
E19 1070 height of 5 feet. But fenced or unfenced, no pool-side is the place
E19 1080 for running or horseplay. We allow no underwater endurance contests,
E19 1090 either, or inexpert versions of water polo.   Diving boards must
E19 1100 have non-skid surfaces (coco matting takes an awful beating from chlorine
E19 1110 and rots quickly, but grit-impregnated paints are excellent). And
E19 1120 divers must be enjoined to look before they leap, either on top of
E19 1130 someone else or onto a pool edge.   Our pools also have wide, shallow
E19 1140 steps- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus
E19 1150 be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords.
E19 1160    All bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool
E19 1170 and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups.
E19 1180    When you first acquire a pool, we earnestly recommend- for your
E19 1190 own mental health- a good long chat with your insurance agent. You
E19 1200 should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty
E19 1210 pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits.
E19 1220    Soignee pools, alas, do not just happen. They are the
E19 1230 result of a constant and careful contest with the elements. Unless
E19 1240 you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your
E19 1250 leisure hours nursing your pool's pristine purity, its care and
E19 1260 feeding- from ~pH content to filtering and vacuuming- is best left
E19 1270 to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service. Of course, if your
E19 1280 pool is close to the house, your wife can always add it to her housekeeping
E19 1290 chores (you hope). Or you can make pool care the price of swimming
E19 1300 for teen-agers. Even so, every pool owner, in case of emergency,
E19 1310 should have some idea of what makes things work. A brief course in
E19 1320 hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future
E19 1330 crisis. #PRESERVING THE POOL# A sudden high rise in temperature
E19 1340 will turn your pool poison green overnight. You need more chlorine. The
E19 1350 walls feel slippery. You need algaecide. With or without professional
E19 1360 help, you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself
E19 1370 unless you have a full-time pool nurse.   You should see to it
E19 1380 that the trap, the dirt-catcher in front of the filter, is always clean.
E19 1390 A pool is no place for a shut trap.   You should firmly insist
E19 1400 that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water. When shed,
E19 1410 they leave rust marks.   You can hope against hope that come spring
E19 1420 cleaning, your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing
E19 1430 and furbishing. It has happened.   Many hours of spring cleaning
E19 1440 will be saved, however, if you remove the main drain grate when you
E19 1450 close the pool season in the fall. As the pool is emptied, stand by
E19 1460 to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet. Much of
E19 1470 the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp, but requires dynamite
E19 1480 if allowed to dry. If you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe, you may
E19 1490 easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out. Of course, when
E19 1500 your 6-inch torrent of water is released, it may cause a lot of comment
E19 1510 as it passes through or by neighboring properties. Do not forget
E19 1520 this possibility.   If your pool is located on or near sloping
E19 1530 ground, it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable
E19 1540 than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping
E19 1550 out the water and then scooping out all the debris.   It may be
E19 1560 true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene, but lights also attract
E19 1570 all the insect life for miles around. Once on the water, these
E19 1580 little visitors seldom leave, and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming
E19 1590 problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those
E19 1600 present. Often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light
E19 1610 you need at much less expense.   Our experience has taught
E19 1620 us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible, from pipes to
E19 1625 brushes.
E19 1630 Follow pool-care instructions to the letter, and be sure that one
E19 1640 person (in the family or not) is regularly responsible for each aspect
E19 1650 of the job, with no chance for claiming, "It wasn't my turn".
E19 1660    Never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves-
E19 1670 even if the little boys do want to play space ship. You may find yourself
E19 1680 hitting bottom, literally, as you discover that water is running
E19 1690 out even while you are putting it in.
E20 0010    DRAW a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania.
E20 0020 Any house built now below that line without air conditioning
E20 0030 will be <obsolete in 10 years>. Fortunately, it is the ~FHA
E20 0040 which has arrived at this conclusion, for it means that cooling equipment
E20 0050 of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage, and thus acquired
E20 0060 with a minimum of financial stress. Even if you live above that line,
E20 0070 the ~FHA will back you, for they have decided that the inclusion
E20 0080 of air conditioning in <all> new homes is a good thing and should
E20 0090 be encouraged.   New simplified packaged units, recently devised
E20 0100 prefabricated glass-fiber ducts, and improved add-on techniques make
E20 0110 it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as
E20 0120 little as $600 to $900. Two men can often do the installation in a
E20 0130 day. You can install it yourself- this is a central system that will
E20 0140 cool <every part> of your house. Its upkeep? No less an authority
E20 0150 than the ~FHA concurs that the savings air conditioning makes
E20 0160 possible more than offset its operating costs. _IS IT WORTH-WHILE?_
E20 0170 Home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days
E20 0180 of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted. We know
E20 0190 now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually
E20 0200 desirable, and accurate controls assure the comfort we want.
E20 0210 We know, too, that health is never harmed by summer cooling. On the
E20 0220 contrary, there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills. The filtered
E20 0230 air benefits allergies, asthma, sinus, hay fever. Control of temperature
E20 0240 and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid. Heart conditions
E20 0250 and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive
E20 0260 heat.   Housekeeping is easier. The cleaner air means
E20 0270 less time spent pushing a vacuum, fewer trips to the dry cleaners, lighter
E20 0280 loads for the washing machine. The need for reupholstering, redecorating,
E20 0290 repainting becomes more infrequent. Clothes hold their shape
E20 0300 better, and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words.   It
E20 0310 will improve your disposition. When you're less fatigued, things
E20 0320 just naturally look brighter. The children can have their daytime naps
E20 0330 and hot meals, and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms.
E20 0340 You'll sleep longer and better, too, awake refreshed and free of
E20 0350 hot weather nerves.   You can forget about screens, and leave the
E20 0360 storm windows up all year around.   Best of all, central air conditioning
E20 0370 is something you can afford. Like its long-lived cousin,
E20 0380 the refrigerator, a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years
E20 0390 or more. That brings its per-year cost down mighty low. _FOR ANY
E20 0400 HOUSE._ No matter what style your home is, ranch, two-story, Colonial
E20 0410 or contemporary, central air conditioning is easily installed. The
E20 0420 equipment won't take up valuable space either. It can go in out-of-the-way
E20 0430 waste space.   But there's no denying that the easiest
E20 0440 and most economical way to get year-'round whole-house air conditioning
E20 0450 is when you build. If that's done, the house can be designed
E20 0470 and oriented for best operation, and this can mean savings both in the
E20 0480 size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself.   If you
E20 0490 can't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building,
E20 0500 by all means <make provision for its easy adding later>. Manufacturers
E20 0510 have designed equipment for just such circumstances, and your
E20 0520 savings over starting from scratch will be substantial.   If your
E20 0530 house is to have a forced warm air system, cooling can be a part of
E20 0540 it. This costs less than having a completely separate cooling system,
E20 0550 for your regular heating ductwork, filters and furnace blower do double
E20 0560 duty for cooling. You can get year-'round air conditioners in the
E20 0570 same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone- high or
E20 0580 low boy, horizontal or counterflow. The units can be installed in basement,
E20 0590 attic, crawlspace, or in a closet located in the living area. The
E20 0600 cooling coil is located in the furnace's outlet. From the coil
E20 0610 small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set
E20 0620 in the yard, garage, carport, or basement.   If you plan to add
E20 0630 cooling later to your heating system, there are things to watch for.
E20 0640 Be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed.
E20 0650 They may be inaccessible later. <Be sure your ducts and blower are
E20 0660 big enough to handle cooling>. This is especially important if you
E20 0670 live in a mild-winter zone. <Be sure you get a perimeter heating system>,
E20 0680 and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for
E20 0690 heating.   You can get a hot water system that will also work
E20 0700 for cooling your house. For cooling, chilled water is circulated instead
E20 0710 of hot water. Instead of radiators you'll have cooling-heating
E20 0720 units, each with its own thermostat. These systems are more expensive
E20 0730 than year-'round forced air systems. The minimum cost for an average
E20 0740 one-story, 7-room house with basement, is likely to run $1500 above
E20 0750 the cost of the heating alone. _SEPARATE SYSTEMS._ If the problems
E20 0760 of combining cooling with your heating are knotty, it may be cheaper
E20 0770 to plan on a completely separate cooling system. The simplest kind
E20 0780 of separate system uses a single, self-contained unit. It is, in effect,
E20 0790 an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts
E20 0800 to distribute the cooled, cleaned, dehumidified air where it is wanted.
E20 0810    In a long, rambling ranch, two such units can be installed,
E20 0820 one serving the living area, the other the sleeping zone. In a two-story
E20 0830 house, one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first
E20 0840 floor, another in the attic to cool the second. In each case, having
E20 0850 separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of
E20 0860 permitting individual zone control. _THE HEAT PUMP._ One of the
E20 0870 more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched
E20 0880 to heating. As you know, a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping
E20 0890 the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors. A relatively
E20 0900 simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine
E20 0910 literally runs backward, and the heat is extracted from outdoor air
E20 0920 and turned indoors.   Up until recently, this heat pump method
E20 0930 of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when
E20 0940 outside temperatures were above 40 degrees. Now, the machine has been
E20 0950 improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat
E20 0960 at temperatures down to 15 degrees. You can get this added heating
E20 0970 feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone.
E20 0980    Consider it as a standby setup, at negligible cost, for those
E20 0990 emergencies when the furnace quits, a blizzard holds up fuel delivery,
E20 1000 or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don't want to start
E20 1010 up your whole heating plant. _WHAT SIZE CONDITIONER?_ How large
E20 1020 a cooling unit you need, and the method of its installation, depends
E20 1030 on a variety of factors. Among other things, besides the nature of
E20 1040 your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from
E20 1050 the outside, it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup
E20 1060 of your family. Families with children usually don't want the house
E20 1070 quite so cool. If you are a party thrower, you may need added capacity.
E20 1080 The body is a heat machine, and 20 to 25 guests can easily double
E20 1090 your cooling load.   Cooling requirements are best expressed in
E20 1100 terms of ~BTU's. A ~BTU is a unit of heat, and the ~BTU
E20 1110 rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can
E20 1120 pump <out> of your house in an hour. A very rough rule of thumb is
E20 1130 that, under favorable conditions, you'll need 15 ~BTU's of cooling
E20 1140 for every square foot of your house. This is if outdoor temperatures
E20 1150 have a high average of 95 degrees. You'll need more if the high
E20 1160 average is above that, less if it's below.   Coolers are also
E20 1170 rated by tons. A ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by
E20 1180 melting a ton of ice. By accepted definition, a 1-ton conditioner will
E20 1190 provide 12,000 ~BTU of cooling in one hour.   You may find
E20 1200 a conditioner rated by horsepower. It is generally an inaccurate
E20 1210 method of rating, for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor,
E20 1220 and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you'll
E20 1230 get. A 1-~hp conditioner, for example, may vary in effectiveness
E20 1240 from under 8,000 ~BTU to well over 10,000 ~BTU.   The
E20 1250 safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit
E20 1260 you need, rather than trying to do this yourself.   Don't urge
E20 1270 your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be
E20 1280 sure you have enough. Better to have your equipment slightly undersized
E20 1290 than too big. Here's why:   Reducing humidity is often
E20 1300 as important as cooling. An oversize unit will cool off your house quickly,
E20 1310 then shut down for a long period. Before it cycles on again, humidity
E20 1320 can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature
E20 1330 is still low. With a unit of the right size, a compressor will
E20 1340 run continuously during hot weather, reducing humidity as evenly as it
E20 1350 does temperature. _MONEY-SAVING TIPS._ Attention to details can
E20 1360 cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately.
E20 1370 A well-designed, 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled
E20 1380 and heated for as little as $128 a year, or $11 a month.
E20 1390 If you have a house which heat doesn't penetrate easily, your unit
E20 1400 will have less heat to remove. Keep the direct sun from reaching the
E20 1410 house and you've won the first battle. In a new house, generous roof
E20 1420 overhangs are a logical and effective solution. If the house you plan
E20 1430 to buy or build won't have big overhangs, you can still do a fair
E20 1440 job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed
E20 1450 trellises, fences and awnings.   Shade trees, too, are a big help,
E20 1460 so keep them if you can. Drawn blinds and draperies do some good,
E20 1470 but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house.
E20 1480    The more directly the sun strikes walls and roof, the greater
E20 1490 its heat impact. The way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence
E20 1500 how much cooling you're going to need. A shift in the walls,
E20 1510 or a change in the roof slope, so the sun hits them more obliquely, can
E20 1520 save you money.   You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the
E20 1530 sun, double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation. <Restrict
E20 1540 large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house>.
E20 1550 They're easier to shade there. An attic space above insulation makes
E20 1560 a house easier to cool. You'll even gain by putting your water
E20 1570 heater outside the conditioned space, and using an electric range instead
E20 1580 of a gas one. Gas adds to the moisture load.   Insulate, weatherstrip,
E20 1590 double-glaze to the maximum. In insulation, the numbers to
E20 1600 remember are 6-4-2. They stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation
E20 1610 in the ceiling, 4 inches in the side walls, 2 inches in the floors.
E20 1620 Such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling
E20 1630 installation, but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in
E20 1640 heating and cooling. A light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50
E20 1650 per cent.   It costs two to three times as much to remove a ~BTU
E20 1660 in summer as it does to add one in winter, so every solitary ~BTU
E20 1670 is worth attention. You'll foil them in droves, along with
E20 1680 their pal humidity, by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan, a
E20 1690 bathroom ventilator for when you shower, and an outside vent for the
E20 1700 clothes drier. _KEEPING CONDITIONERS QUIET._ It's no use pretending
E20 1710 that all conditioners are quiet, but the noise they produce can
E20 1720 be kept to a minimum. Good workmanship is important in the installation,
E20 1730 so if you're doing your own contracting, don't award the job on
E20 1740 the basis of price alone.   Avoid attic placement directly above
E20 1750 a bedroom.
E21 0010 ## MOST RECREATION WORK calls for a good deal of pre-planning.
E21 0020 This is particularly true in site selection. You must know before
E21 0030 you start what the needs and objectives of your organtion are; you
E21 0040 must have a list of requirements on where, how many, and what type sites
E21 0050 are needed. With such a program you can make constructive selections
E21 0060 of the best sites available.   Begin the examination of a site
E21 0070 with a good map and aerial photos if possible. These are becoming more
E21 0080 and more available through the work of counties and other government
E21 0090 agencies. The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal
E21 0100 government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural
E21 0110 features of the site. These are inexpensive and available from the U&
E21 0120 S& Geological Society, Washington 25, D& C&. In recent
E21 0130 years many counties and the U& S& Forest Service have taken
E21 0140 aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning
E21 0150 use. Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer
E21 0160 showing roads and other features and from the assessor's office
E21 0170 showing ownerships of land.   Inspect the site in the field during
E21 0180 the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for
E21 0190 recreation. This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the
E21 0200 climate conditions, the exposure to the sun and wind, the water interests,
E21 0210 etcetera, which vary greatly with the seasons. It is usually helpful
E21 0220 to make a sketch map in the field, showing the size and location
E21 0230 of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site. These
E21 0240 are a great aid for planning use back at the office. ## FOR
E21 0250 SITE PLANNING WORK, it is best to have a qualified and experienced
E21 0260 park planner to carry through the study. However, there is also much
E21 0270 to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are
E21 0280 available and interested in recreation. County judges, commissioners,
E21 0290 engineers, assessors, and others who have lived in the area for a
E21 0300 long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions
E21 0310 to offer from their varied professional experiences. A visit to the site
E21 0320 by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify
E21 0330 opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area.
E21 0340    How much study is required? This, of course, depends on
E21 0350 the character of the site itself, the previous experience of the investigator,
E21 0360 and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision.
E21 0370 It is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick
E21 0375 judgment
E21 0380 of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone. Usually
E21 0390 there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions.
E21 0400 A site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance
E21 0410 today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little
E21 0420 development or water. The same is true of areas which at first look
E21 0430 good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually
E21 0440 be poor areas to develop for general public use.   In looking for
E21 0450 the best sites available that meet the requirements, you need information
E21 0460 to compare the site with others. You need answers to four important
E21 0470 questions.   @ What are the existing recreation features?
E21 0480    @ How well can the site be developed?   @ How useful
E21 0490 will it be to the public?   @ Is this site available?
E21 0500    Check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests
E21 0510 already existing at the site. Naturally, a park site with scenic
E21 0520 views, a good lake, trees, and sand dunes, will attract more people
E21 0530 than a nearby area with only trees and dunes. Quality is vitally important.
E21 0540 Frontage on a body of clear, clean water will be vastly different
E21 0550 from the same amount of frontage on polluted water. Some recreation
E21 0560 features, such as scenic values and water interest, also have greater
E21 0570 overall value than other interests.   One of the most desirable
E21 0580 features for a park are beautiful views or scenery. It may be distant
E21 0590 views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a
E21 0600 small lake, colorful rock formations, or unusual trees. A site which
E21 0610 overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating
E21 0620 traffic. An area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf
E21 0630 rolling in on a beach. A site may also be attractive just through
E21 0640 the beauty of its trees and shrubs. Note extent of these interests and
E21 0650 how available they will be for the public to enjoy.   Water interest
E21 0660 is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation
E21 0670 site. Most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas.
E21 0680 This follows naturally since frontage on an ocean, stream, or lake
E21 0690 provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation
E21 0700 activities of bathing, fishing, boating, and other water sports.
E21 0710 A body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract
E21 0720 the greatest picnic and camping use. It also cools the air in summer
E21 0730 and nourishes the trees and wild life.   The amount of water
E21 0740 frontage, the quantity and quality of the water, and the recreation
E21 0750 afforded by it are important. A restricted frontage may be too crowded
E21 0760 an area for public use. The quantity of water flow may be critical;
E21 0770 a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant
E21 0780 or dry in late summer. If the site is on a reservoir, the level
E21 0790 of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be
E21 0800 studied. Check the quality of the water. A stream which has all of
E21 0810 its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation
E21 0820 practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one
E21 0830 passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area. Other
E21 0840 factors, such as water temperature, depth of water, the fish life it
E21 0850 supports, wave action, flooding, etcetera, will affect its recreation
E21 0860 value. ## OTHER NATURAL FEATURES which can be of high interest
E21 0870 are the forests, canyons, mountains, deserts, seacoast, beaches, sand
E21 0880 dunes, waterfalls, springs, etcetera with which the area is blessed.
E21 0890 Just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which
E21 0900 are of national or state significance, counties should seek out these
E21 0910 features which are distinctive of their area. Although the site may
E21 0920 not contain the features themselves, there are often opportunities
E21 0930 to include them as additional interest to the site. The route to the
E21 0940 park may lead people past them or display views of them. A group of
E21 0950 native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can
E21 0960 be featured at the site.   The fish, animals, and birds which
E21 0970 may be found at the site are another interest. Fishing interest calls
E21 0980 for a check of the species found, quantity and size, the season they
E21 0990 are available, and the stocking program of the fish commission. Animals
E21 1000 may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas. The
E21 1010 site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its
E21 1020 own resident bird life. Clams, crabs, and other marine life may add
E21 1030 interest at coastal areas. ## EACH AREA has its own historical
E21 1040 interests with which much can be done. Park visitors are always
E21 1050 eager to learn more about the area they are in. The historical sign
E21 1060 tells its story, but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the
E21 1070 original historical items or places themselves which still have the
E21 1080 character of the period covered. Notice should be taken of unusual rock
E21 1090 formations, deposits, or shapes of the earth's crust in your region.
E21 1100 Those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area
E21 1110 can add geological interest to the recreation sites. An old shipwreck,
E21 1120 a high dam, an old covered bridge, a place to find agates or other
E21 1130 semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold, etcetera may be of interest.
E21 1140 Some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient Indian
E21 1150 village sites or hunting areas, caves, artifacts, etcetera.
E21 1160 How well can the site be developed? Look at the physical features
E21 1170 of the land to determine how desirable it is for use, what can be done
E21 1180 to correct the faults, and what it will cost to make the area meet your
E21 1190 needs in comparison to other sites. Many things need to be checked:
E21 1200 #SIZE AND SHAPE#- The size of the area alone can be a determining
E21 1210 factor. An area may be too small for the needs of the project.
E21 1220 Areas should be large enough to include the attractions, have ample
E21 1230 space for the use of facilities needed, and have room around the edges
E21 1240 to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments.
E21 1250 Acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation
E21 1260 areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical
E21 1270 to operate one large area than several small ones.   Shape
E21 1280 of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the
E21 1290 development. A large picnic area or camping development is most efficient
E21 1300 in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width
E21 1310 in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide. This
E21 1320 is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your
E21 1330 buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions. However, a
E21 1340 narrow strip may be very practical for small developments, or to provide
E21 1350 additional stream frontage for a fisherman's trail, or include
E21 1360 scenic strips within the park unit. #ADJOINING AREAS#- The values
E21 1370 of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands,
E21 1380 ownership and use of the land, and the utilities available there. For
E21 1390 instance, a site adjoining other publicly owned lands, such as a national
E21 1400 forest or a public road, may be desirable, whereas a site next
E21 1410 to an industrial plant might not. The utilities available nearby may
E21 1420 provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the
E21 1430 site. #TOPOGRAPHY#- Topography is very important. Check the
E21 1440 elevation of the ground, degree and direction of slopes, drainage, rock
E21 1450 outcrops, topsoil types and quality, as well as subsoil. Nearly level
E21 1460 areas are required for parking areas, beaches, camp areas, ballfields,
E21 1470 etcetera. Determine how much topography limits useful area or what
E21 1480 the costs of earth moving or grading might be. #WATER#- In addition
E21 1490 to its recreation interests, water is needed for drinking, sanitation,
E21 1500 and irrigation. The quantity and quality of water sources is
E21 1510 often a big factor in site selection. The area may provide good springs
E21 1520 or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines. Figure
E21 1530 the cost of providing water to the use areas. #PLANTS#- The
E21 1540 existing plant growth calls for thorough checking. Look at the trees
E21 1550 as to size and interest, the amount of shade they provide, how healthy
E21 1560 they are, the problems of maintenance, fire hazards, wind throw,
E21 1570 etcetera.   An area may have been partially logged and requires
E21 1580 removal of stumps or clean up. Some shrubs may be of good landscaping
E21 1590 value, other areas of brush may need to be cleared. The extent and location
E21 1600 of open areas is noted. #EXPOSURE#- How much will wind,
E21 1610 rain, sun, and temperature affect the use? An area sheltered from
E21 1620 strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use. The direction,
E21 1630 velocity, and season of these winds should be noted as to just how
E21 1640 they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation
E21 1650 of the area. Lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for
E21 1660 the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable.
E21 1670 Sometimes, you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography
E21 1680 or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade, morning sun, or
E21 1690 whatever may be most desirable for the use intended. #IMPROVEMENTS#-
E21 1700 Some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings,
E21 1710 roads, utilities, cleared land, etcetera which may raise the cost of
E21 1720 the site.
E22 0010    Your invitation to write about Serge Prokofieff to honor his
E22 0020 70th Anniversary for the April issue of <Sovietskaya Muzyka> is
E22 0030 accepted with pleasure, because I admire the music of Prokofieff;
E22 0040 and with sober purpose, because the development of Prokofieff personifies,
E22 0050 in many ways, the course of music in the Union of Soviet Socialist
E22 0060 Republics.   The Serge Prokofieff whom we knew in the
E22 0070 United States of America was gay, witty, mercurial, full of pranks
E22 0080 and <bonheur>- and very capable as a professional musician. These
E22 0090 qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic
E22 0100 <haute monde> which supported the concert world of the post-World
E22 0110 War /1, era. Prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor
E22 0120 in America was, indeed, brilliant.   Prokofieff's <Classical>
E22 0130 Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted
E22 0140 and well-trained musician still in his twenties. To the Traditionalists,
E22 0150 it was a brilliant satire on modernism; to the Neo-Classicists,
E22 0160 it was a challenge to the pre-war world. What was it to Prokofieff?
E22 0170 A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-Century ideas; a trial
E22 0180 balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times; a brilliant <piece
E22 0190 de resistance?> Certainly its composer was an ascending star
E22 0200 on a new world horizon.   I heard the <Classical> Symphony
E22 0210 for the first time when Koussevitzky conducted it in Paris in 1927.
E22 0220 All musical Paris was there. Some musicians were enthusiastic, some
E22 0230 skeptical. I myself was one of the skeptics (35 years ago). I remember
E22 0240 Ernest Bloch in the foyer, shouting in his high-pitched voice:
E22 0250 "**h it may be a <tour de force, mais mon Dieu,> can anyone take
E22 0260 this music seriously"?   The answer is, "Yes"! Certainly,
E22 0270 America took Prokofieff and his <Classical> Symphony seriously,
E22 0280 and with a good deal of pleasure. His life-long friend, Serge
E22 0290 Koussevitzky, gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances
E22 0300 in Boston, New York, and Washington, D& C&, to which
E22 0310 he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation. Chicago was
E22 0320 also a welcome host: there, in 1921, Prokofieff conducted the world
E22 0330 premiere of the <Love for Three Oranges,> and played the first
E22 0340 performance of his Third Piano Concerto. "Uncle Sam" was, indeed,
E22 0350 a rich uncle to Prokofieff, in those opulent, post-war victory
E22 0360 years of peace and prosperity, bold speculations and extravaganzas, enjoyment
E22 0370 and pleasure: "The Golden Twenties". We attended the
E22 0380 premieres of his concertos, symphonies, and suites; we studied, taught,
E22 0390 and performed his piano sonatas, chamber music, gavottes, and marches;
E22 0400 we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities.
E22 0410 We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as
E22 0420 a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth-Century Composers.
E22 0430    Nevertheless, Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during
E22 0440 the Twenties: the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western
E22 0450 World- the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated-
E22 0460 the <chic> Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich
E22 0470 America- the <avant-garde> Paris of Diaghileff, Stravinsky, Koussevitzky,
E22 0480 Cocteau, Picasso- the <laissez-faire> Paris of Dadaism
E22 0490 and ultramodern art- the Paris <sympathique> which took young
E22 0500 composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms.
E22 0510    So young Prokofieff was the darling of success: in his motherland;
E22 0520 in the spacious hunting grounds of "Uncle Sam"; in the exciting
E22 0530 salons of his lovely, brilliant Paris- mistress of gaiety-
E22 0540 excess and abandon- world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone, color,
E22 0550 dance, design, and thought.   Meanwhile, three great terrible
E22 0560 forces were coagulating and crystallizing. In this world-wide conscription
E22 0570 of men, minds, and machines, Prokofieff was recalled to his
E22 0580 native land. The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts
E22 0590 of peace and liberty, and the outraged, freedom-loving peoples of the
E22 0600 Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist
E22 0610 tyranny into cringing submission. After this holocaust, a changing world
E22 0620 occupied the minds of men; a world beset with new boundaries, new
E22 0630 treaties and governments, new goals and methods, and the age-old fears
E22 0635 of aggression
E22 0640 and subjugation- hunger and exposure.   In this
E22 0650 changed world, Prokofieff settled to find himself, and to create
E22 0655 for
E22 0660 large national purpose. Here, this happy, roving son of good fortune
E22 0670 proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic
E22 0680 order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world.
E22 0690 Here, Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism-
E22 0700 producing music for the masses.   It is at this point in his life
E22 0710 that the mature Prokofieff emerges. One might have expected that
E22 0720 such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative
E22 0730 flair of a composer, especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous.
E22 0740    But no: Prokofieff grew. He accepted the environment
E22 0750 of his destiny- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his
E22 0760 early promise. By 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his
E22 0770 people: "I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom, but at
E22 0780 the same time I have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the
E22 0790 accepted methods of harmony and melody. This is precisely what makes
E22 0800 lucid, straightforward music so difficult to compose- the clarity must
E22 0810 be new, not old". How right he was; how clearly he saw the cultural
E22 0820 defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not
E22 0830 or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism. And
E22 0840 with what resource did Prokofieff back up his Credo of words- with
E22 0850 torrents of powerful music. Compare the vast difference in scope and
E22 0860 beauty between his neat and witty little <Classical> Symphony and
E22 0870 his big, muscular, passionate, and eloquent Fifth Symphony; or the
E22 0880 <Love for Three Oranges> (gay as it is) with the wonderful, imaginative,
E22 0890 colorful, and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet,
E22 0900 <The Stone Flower>. This masterpiece has gaiety, too, but it is
E22 0910 the gaiety of dancing people: earthy, salty and humorous.   Of
E22 0920 course, these works are not comparable, even though the same brain conceived
E22 0930 them. The early works were conceived for a sophisticated, international
E22 0940 audience; the later works were conceived to affirm a way
E22 0950 of life for fellow citizens. However, in all of Prokofieff's music,
E22 0960 young or mature, we find his profile- his "signature"- his
E22 0970 craftsman's attitude. Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the
E22 0980 cause of experimentation <per se>. In orchestration, he stretches
E22 0990 the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination
E22 1000 for color. His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable.
E22 1010 His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and
E22 1020 love songs is captivating: witty, clever, adroit, and subtle. His
E22 1030 counterpoint is pertinent, skillful, and rarely thick.   Also,
E22 1040 it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic
E22 1050 modulations, the brilliant orchestrations, the adroitness for evading
E22 1060 the heaviness of figured bass, the skill in florid counterpoint
E22 1070 were not lost in his mature output, even in the spectacular historical
E22 1080 dramas of the stage and cinema, where a large, dramatic canvas of sound
E22 1090 was required. That Prokofieff's harmonies and forms sometimes
E22 1100 seem professionally routine to our ears, may or may not indicate that
E22 1110 he was less of an "original" than we prefer to believe. Need for
E22 1120 novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability.
E22 1130 Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero, who, by the force of
E22 1140 his creative life, helped preserve the main stream of tradition, to which
E22 1150 the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually
E22 1160 added and integrated.   At this date, it seems probable that the
E22 1170 name of Serge Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History,
E22 1180 as an effective Traditionalist, who was fully aware of the lure and danger
E22 1190 of experimentation, and used it as it served his purpose; yet
E22 1200 was never caught up in it- never a slave to its academic dialectics.
E22 1210 Certainly, it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared
E22 1220 him to the Western World- not his experimentations.   So
E22 1230 Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a
E22 1240 rich reward from them. Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would
E22 1250 have done better, or even as well, under different circumstances.
E22 1260 His fellow-countryman, Igor Stravinsky, certainly did not. Why did
E22 1270 Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity, while Stravinsky (who leaped
E22 1280 into fame like a young giant) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness?
E22 1290 I think the answer is to be found in Prokofieff's own words:
E22 1300 "the clarity must be new, not old". When Prokofieff forged his
E22 1310 new clarity of "lucid, straightforward music, so difficult to compose",
E22 1320 he shaped his talents to his purpose.   When Stravinsky
E22 1330 shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures, many salons,
E22 1340 many dialectics, many personalities, he tried to refashion himself
E22 1350 into a stylist of many styles, determined by many disparate cultures.
E22 1360 Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own
E22 1370 people- by the compass of their national ideas. But Stravinsky
E22 1380 was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting. In
E22 1390 all his miscalculations, Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder
E22 1400 of presuming that he could transform other composers' inspirations-
E22 1410 representing many peoples, time periods and styles- into his own
E22 1420 music by warping the harmony, melody, or form, to verify his own experiments.
E22 1430 Because of the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic
E22 1440 materials, and his flair for orchestrations- his brilliant <Petruchka,>
E22 1450 his savage <Sacre du Printemps,> his incisive <Les Noces>-
E22 1460 the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical
E22 1470 direction for which his native talents were predisposed.   But
E22 1480 time is running out, and many of Stravinsky's admirers begin to fear
E22 1490 that he will never find <terra firma>. His various aesthetic postulates
E22 1500 remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself: Supra-Expressionism,
E22 1510 Neo-Paganism, Neo-Classicism, Neo-Romanticism,
E22 1520 Neo-Jazz, Neo-Ecclesiasticism, Neo-Popularism, and most recently,
E22 1530 Post-Serialism- all competing with each other within one composer!
E22 1540 What a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations! Meager
E22 1550 and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty
E22 1555 protagonist;
E22 1560 a maladroit reharmonization of our National Anthem (<The
E22 1570 Star-Spangled Banner>); a poor attempt to write an idiomatic
E22 1580 jazz concerto; a circus polka for elephants; his hopes that the tunes
E22 1590 from his old music might be used for popular American commercial
E22 1600 songs! Stravinsky, nearing the age of eighty, is like a lost and frantic
E22 1610 bird, flitting from one abandoned nest to another, searching for
E22 1620 a home.   How differently Prokofieff's life unfolded. Prokofieff
E22 1630 was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing
E22 1640 world without losing his particular force and direction. In the process,
E22 1650 his native endowments were stretched, strengthened and disciplined
E22 1660 to serve their human purpose.   With a large and circumspect
E22 1670 20th-Century technique, he wove the materials of national heroes and
E22 1680 events, national folklore and children's fairy tales- Slavic dances
E22 1690 and love songs- into a solid musical literature which served his
E22 1700 people well, and is providing much enjoyment to the World at large.
E22 1710    Of course, it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical
E22 1720 feat, Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind
E22 1730 him; time and economic security; symphony orchestras, opera and ballet
E22 1740 companies; choruses, chamber music ensembles; soloists; recordings;
E22 1750 broadcastings; television; large and eager audiences. It
E22 1760 must be conceded that his native land provided Prokofieff with many
E22 1770 of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive: economic
E22 1780 security and cultural opportunities, incisive idioms, social fermentations
E22 1790 for a new national ideology- a sympathetic public and a large
E22 1800 body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose.   Thus
E22 1810 in Prokofieff the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics produced
E22 1820 one of the great composers of the Twentieth Century. That his moods,
E22 1830 even in his early years, are those of his people, does him honor,
E22 1840 as his music honors those who inspired it. That he mastered every aspect
E22 1850 of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary
E22 1860 judgments, is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous
E22 1870 pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture;
E22 1880 and perhaps of even greater significance- his music is strong 20th-Century
E22 1890 evidence of the effectiveness of Evolution, based on a broad
E22 1900 Traditionalism for the creative art of music.
E22 1910    April 10 marked a memorable date in New York's musical history-
E22 1920 indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern United States.
E22 1930 On that date the Musicians Emergency Fund, organized to furnish
E22 1940 employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the
E22 1950 depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes
E22 1960 in the stock market crash, observed its 30th anniversary.
E23 0010 ROY MASON IS ESSENTIALLY A LANDSCAPE PAINTER whose style and direction
E23 0020 has a kinship with the English watercolorists of the early nineteenth
E23 0030 century, especially the beautifully patterned art of John Sell
E23 0040 Cotman. And like this English master, Mason realizes his subjects
E23 0050 in large, simplified masses which, though they seem effortless, are
E23 0060 in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough
E23 0070 distillation of the natural form that inspired them.   As a
E23 0080 boy Roy Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the
E23 0090 out-of-doors, its tang of weather, its change of seasons, its variable
E23 0100 moods. His father, a professional engraver and an amateur landscape
E23 0110 painter, took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions, and imparted
E23 0120 to them his knowledge and love of nature. Out of this background of
E23 0130 hunting and fishing, it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects
E23 0140 he knew best: hunters in the field, fishermen in the stream, ducks
E23 0150 and geese on the wing- almost always against a vast backdrop of
E23 0160 weather landscape. It is this subject matter that has brought Mason
E23 0170 a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen, but it is his exceptional
E23 0180 performance with this motif that commends him to artists and
E23 0190 discerning collectors.   Mason had to earn the privilege of devoting
E23 0200 himself exclusively to painting. Like many others, he had to work
E23 0210 hard, long hours in a struggling family business which, though it was
E23 0220 allied to art of a kind- the design and production of engraved seals-
E23 0230 bore no relation to the painting of pictures. But it did teach
E23 0240 Roy the basic techniques of commercial art, and later, for twelve years,
E23 0250 he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia.
E23 0260 On the death of their father, they returned to their home
E23 0270 in Batavia, New York. After more years of concentrated effort, Roy
E23 0280 and his brother Max finally established a thriving family business
E23 0290 at the old stand.   During all this time Roy continued to paint,
E23 0300 first only on weekends, and then, as the family business permitted,
E23 0310 for longer periods. Gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether,
E23 0320 and for the past thirty years, he has worked independently as a painter,
E23 0330 except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions. But even
E23 0340 on these, the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off!
E23 0350    Except for a rich friendship with the painter, Chauncey Ryder
E23 0360 who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had- and
E23 0370 this was limited to a few lessons, though the two artists often went on
E23 0380 painting trips together- Roy developed his art by himself. In the
E23 0390 best tradition, he first taught himself to see, then to draw with accuracy
E23 0400 and assurance, and then to paint. He worked in oil for years before
E23 0410 beginning his work in watercolor, and his first public recognition
E23 0420 and early honors, including his election to the Academy, were for
E23 0430 his essays in the heavier medium. Gradually watercolor claimed his greater
E23 0440 affection until today it has become his major, if not exclusive,
E23 0450 technique.   It has been my privilege to paint with Roy Mason
E23 0460 on numerous occasions, mostly in the vicinity of Batavia. More often
E23 0470 than not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at
E23 0480 a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature
E23 0490 into a composed, not imitative, painting. What I have observed
E23 0500 time and time again is a process of integration, integration that begins
E23 0510 as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form; color
E23 0520 patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition;
E23 0530 and that over-all, amazing control of large washes which is the Mason
E23 0540 stylemark. Finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the
E23 0550 job is done. Inspiring- yes; instructive- maybe; duplicable-
E23 0560 no!   But for the technical fact, we have the artist's
E23 0570 own testimony:   "Of late years, I find that I like best to
E23 0580 work out-of-doors. First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in
E23 0590 quarter scale (approximately **f inches) in which I pay particular attention
E23 0600 to the design principles of three simple values- the lightest
E23 0610 light, the middle tone, and the darkest dark- by reducing the forms
E23 0620 of my subject to these large patterns. If a human figure or wild life
E23 0630 are to be part of the projected final picture, I try to place them
E23 0640 in the initial sketch. For me, these will belong more completely to
E23 0650 their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage, though
E23 0660 I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on
E23 0670 the full sheet when it serves my final purpose.   "I am thoroughly
E23 0680 convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects
E23 0690 nature will do his composing for him; as a result, such pictures are
E23 0700 only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before
E23 0710 him. Just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot
E23 0720 is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting,
E23 0730 unless the position serves the design of the whole composition.
E23 0740 If the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain
E23 0750 units in his design, often only slightly, finer pictures would result.
E23 0760 Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other
E23 0770 objects like trees, logs, and bushes can be traced from the original
E23 0780 sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they
E23 0790 occupy the right position, which I call 'clicking'.   "Speed
E23 0800 in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity
E23 0810 and crispness, but unless the artist has lots of experience so that
E23 0820 he can control rapid execution, he would do well to take these first sketches
E23 0830 and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition.
E23 0840    "If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition,
E23 0850 I mean to project equal concern for color. Often, in working
E23 0860 out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere, a particular
E23 0870 passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be
E23 0880 too bright, too dull, or too light, or too dark when viewed indoors in
E23 0890 a mat. When this occurs, I make the change on the sketch or on the
E23 0900 final watercolor- if I have been working on a full sheet in the field.
E23 0910    "When working from one of my sketches I square it up and
E23 0920 project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal.
E23 0930 When this linear draft is completed, I dust it down to a faint
E23 0940 image. From this point, I paint in as direct a manner as possible, by
E23 0950 flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can manage.
E23 0960 However, first
E23 0965 I thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and
E23 0970 design along the lines I have described. Then I plan my attack:
E23 0980 the parts I will finish first, the range of values, the accenting of
E23 0990 minor details- all in all, mechanics of producing the finished job
E23 1000 with a maximum of crispness. The longer I work, the more I am sure
E23 1010 that for me, at least, a workmanlike method is important. Trial and
E23 1020 error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles
E23 1030 in the final painting.   "As for materials, I use the
E23 1040 best available. I work on a watercolor easel in the field, and frequently
E23 1050 resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue
E23 1060 strain. In my studio I work at a tilt-top table, but leave the paper
E23 1070 unfixed so that I can move it freely to control the washes. I have
E23 1080 used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers, but prefer an English
E23 1090 make, rough surface, in 400-pound weight. After selecting a sheet
E23 1100 and inspecting it for flaws (even the best sometimes has foreign 'nubbins'
E23 1110 on its surface), I sponge it thoroughly on both sides with
E23 1120 clean, cold water. Then I dry the sheet under mild pressure so that
E23 1130 it will lie flat as a board.   "In addition to the usual tools,
E23 1140 I make constant use of cleansing tissue, not only to wipe my brushes,
E23 1150 but to mop up certain areas, to soften edges, and to open up lights
E23 1160 in dark washes. The great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that
E23 1170 it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the
E23 1180 watercolorist. I also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large
E23 1185 washes in the studio.
E23 1190    "My brushes are different from those used
E23 1200 by most watercolorists, for I combine the sable and the bristle. The
E23 1210 red sables are @8; two riggers, @6 and @10; and a very large,
E23 1220 flat wash brush. The bristles are a Fitch @2 and a one-half
E23 1230 inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge.   "My usual palette
E23 1240 consists of top-quality colors: alizarin crimson, orange, raw sienna,
E23 1250 raw umber, burnt sienna, sepia, cerulean blue, cobalt blue, French
E23 1260 ultramarine blue, Winsor green, Hooker's green @2, cadmium yellow
E23 1270 pale, yellow ochre, Payne's gray, charcoal gray, Davy's gray,
E23 1280 and ivory black".   In analyzing the watercolors of Roy Mason,
E23 1290 the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness,
E23 1300 yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration
E23 1310 here. True, a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis
E23 1320 of nature rather than a detailed inventory. Unlike many decorative patterns
E23 1330 that present a static flat convention, this artist's pictures
E23 1340 are full of atmosphere and climate.   Long observation has taught
E23 1350 Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes:
E23 1360 a foreground in sharp focus- either a light area with dark accents
E23 1370 or a dark one with lights; a middle distance often containing the
E23 1380 major motif; and a background, usually a silhouetted form foiled against
E23 1390 the sky. In following this general principle, Mason provides the
E23 1400 observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background,
E23 1410 and the illusion of depth is instantly created.   When painting,
E23 1420 Mason's physical eyes are half-closed, while his mind's eye
E23 1430 is wide open, and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression
E23 1440 he wishes to convey. He does not insist on telling all he knows about
E23 1450 any given subject; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw
E23 1460 on his memory, his imagination, his nostalgia. It is for this
E23 1470 reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition
E23 1480 of place for their enjoyment. His pictures generalize, though
E23 1490 they are inspired by a particular locale; they universalize in terms
E23 1500 of weather, skies, earth, and people. By dealing with common landscape
E23 1510 in an uncommon way, Roy Mason has found a particular niche in American
E23 1520 landscape art. Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience
E23 1530 of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor,
E23 1540 a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor
E23 1550 the Creator of it all.   The artist was born in Gilbert Mills,
E23 1560 New York, in 1886, and until two years ago when he and his wife moved
E23 1570 to California, he lived in western New York, in Batavia. When
E23 1580 I looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be March
E23 1590 15th, I realized that Roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for
E23 1600 a watercolorist: the water sign of Pisces (February 18-March 20).
E23 1610 And how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes, and
E23 1620 how appropriate that he should appear in AMERICAN ARTIST again,
E23 1630 in his natal month of March!   Over the years, beginning in
E23 1640 1929, Mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold
E23 1650 medals; two Ranger Fund purchase awards; the Joseph Pennell
E23 1660 Memorial Medal; two American Watercolor Society prizes; the Blair
E23 1670 Purchase Prize for watercolor, Art Institute of Chicago;
E23 1680 and others in Buffalo, New York, Chautauqua, New Haven, Rochester,
E23 1690 Rockport, and most recently, the $300 prize for a watercolor at
E23 1700 the Laguna Beach Art Association,   He was elected to the National
E23 1710 Academy of Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931
E23 1720 (after receiving his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy
E23 1730 in 1930), and elevated to Academicianship in 1940. Other memberships
E23 1740 include the American Watercolor Society, Philadelphia Water
E23 1750 Color Club, Allied Artists of America, Audubon Artists, Baltimore
E23 1760 Watercolor Society.
E24 0010    The Russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the American gymnasts
E24 0020 in the 1960 Olympics for one reason- they were better. They were
E24 0030 better trained, better looking, better built, better disciplined **h
E24 0040 and something else- <they were better dancers>. Our athletes are
E24 0050 only just beginning to learn that they must study dance. The Russians
E24 0060 are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics.
E24 0070    But why gymnastics at all? And is the sport really important?
E24 0080 After all, we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics
E24 0090 competition. But if it is important, what can we do to improve ourselves?
E24 0100 It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem,
E24 0110 for just as gymnastics can learn from dance, dance has some very
E24 0120 important things to learn from gymnastics.   Taking first things
E24 0130 first, let's understand the sport called gymnastics. It is made up
E24 0140 of tumbling, which might be said to start with a somersault, run through
E24 0150 such stunts as headstands, handstands, cartwheels, backbends, and
E24 0160 culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists
E24 0170 **h and apparatus work. The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a
E24 0180 common sight in American gyms, but about 1930 it was dropped in favor
E24 0190 of games. The parallel bars, horse, buck, springboard, horizontal bar,
E24 0200 rings, and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball,
E24 0210 volleyball, basketball and football.   But the Russians use
E24 0220 gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because
E24 0230 it provides training in every basic quality except one, endurance. The
E24 0240 gymnast must develop strength, flexibility, coordination, timing,
E24 0245 rhythm, courage, discipline, persistence and the desire for perfection.
E24 0250 In short, gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great
E24 0270 deal of character as well. The addition of endurance training later,
E24 0280 when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury,
E24 0290 provides that final quality that makes the top athlete, soldier
E24 0300 or citizen.   Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that
E24 0310 it can be started very early in life. (An enterprising teacher or parent
E24 0320 <could> start training a healthy child at the age of seven days.
E24 0330 Most Europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries.)
E24 0340 In most sports, as in most walks of life, the angels are on the side
E24 0350 of those who begin young, and the Russian competitor of 16 has at
E24 0360 least thirteen years of training behind him. The American is very lucky
E24 0370 if he has three.   If a nation wished to get a head start in
E24 0380 physical fitness over all other nations, it would start its kindergarten
E24 0390 students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus
E24 0400 eliminate a large number of the problems that plague American schools.
E24 0410 First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension,
E24 0420 since action relieves both. Oddly enough, it is proven that there
E24 0430 would be less reading difficulty. Certainly there would be less anxiety,
E24 0440 fewer accidents (it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries),
E24 0450 and higher scholastic averages, since alert children work better.
E24 0460 Russia knows this, and that is why there were over 800,000 competing
E24 0470 for places as candidates for the Olympic gymnastic team. Eighty
E24 0480 thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself. We
E24 0490 could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people.
E24 0500    And what has dancing to do with all this? A great deal.
E24 0510 Russia's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous
E24 0520 training on apparatus. Well-stretched, trained in posture and coordinated
E24 0530 movement, and wedded to rhythm, they presented the audiences
E24 0535 in
E24 0540 Rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any Olympic
E24 0550 contest. American audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons.
E24 0560 They saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing
E24 0570 with incredible grace. They were further stripped of old wive's
E24 0580 tales
E24 0590 by seeing the slender, lovely Russian girls performing feats requiring
E24 0600 tremendous strength **h and with not one bulging muscle.   President
E24 0610 Kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation. If
E24 0620 we wait until children are in junior high or high school, we will never
E24 0630 manage it. To be fit, one has to start early with young children,
E24 0640 and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher
E24 0650 of dance. If the dance teachers of America make it their business
E24 0660 to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come
E24 0670 some day if our schools are really responsible, we will be that much
E24 0680 ahead. School teachers, all too unprepared for the job they must do,
E24 0690 will need demonstrators. There should be youngsters who know how to do
E24 0700 a headstand, and also how to help other children learn it. They should
E24 0710 know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for
E24 0720 the sports we will demand be taught.   Dance teachers can respond
E24 0730 to President Kennedy's request not only through their regular
E24 0740 dance work, but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes
E24 0750 for strength and flexibility.   Very little in today's living
E24 0760 provides the strength we need **h and nothing provides the flexibility.
E24 0770 Dancers do have flexibility. They often fail, however, to develop
E24 0780 real abdominal, back, chest, shoulder and arm strength. Ask any group
E24 0790 of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results,
E24 0800 considering the amount of physical training they have had, will be
E24 0810 very disappointing. Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas.
E24 0820 This isn't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of
E24 0830 the 11-year-old boys in America <cannot chin themselves once>, and
E24 0840 that English school girls outdo them in almost every test (even dashes
E24 0850 and endurance). The only area in which American boys hold their own
E24 0860 is the baseball throw. #THE CHINNING BAR# For arm and shoulder
E24 0870 strength a chinning bar is recommended. It should be installed over
E24 0880 a door that is in full view of everyone, and a chair should be placed
E24 0890 under it, a little to one side. Those children who can chin themselves
E24 0900 should be told to do <one> chin up each time they pass under it.
E24 0910 Those who are too weak, should climb on the chair and, starting at the
E24 0920 top of the chin, let themselves <slowly> down. When they can take
E24 0930 ten seconds to accomplish the descent, they will have the strength to
E24 0940 chin <up>. Parents should be informed about this system and encouraged
E24 0950 to do the same with the whole family at home. #THE HORSE KICK#
E24 0960 Arm, shoulder, chest, upper and lower back strength will be aided with
E24 0970 the Horse Kick. Start on hands and feet. Keeping the hands in
E24 0980 the starting position, run in place to a quick rhythm. After this has
E24 0990 become easy, use slower and slower rhythms, kicking higher and higher.
E24 1000 Follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on
E24 1010 all fours, kicking as high as possible. #PUSH-UPS# Push-ups are
E24 1020 essential, but few have the strength for them at first. Start on the
E24 1030 knees in a large circle. Fall slowly forward onto the hands and let
E24 1040 the body down to rest on the floor. Push back up and repeat. Do this
E24 1050 exercise six times each class period. As strength improves start in
E24 1060 a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward.
E24 1070 Start by falling forward to a point close to the feet, and, as strength
E24 1080 improves, fall farther and farther out. Try to push back to the stand
E24 1090 position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes
E24 1100 from the hands. The push-up itself can be taught by starting at the
E24 1110 <top> of the push-up with legs spread wide. Let the body down slowly,
E24 1120 taking at least five seconds for the letting <down>. Five of these
E24 1130 done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-<up>.
E24 1140 #HANDSTANDS# Handstands come after arms, chest and shoulders
E24 1150 have developed at least a minimum of strength. Of course those
E24 1160 who have developed more will find them easier. Start with the class
E24 1170 standing in a circle, with weight on the right foot and the left extended
E24 1180 a little way into the circle. At first each child should do a kick
E24 1190 up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work
E24 1200 alone, and those who need help. Drop both hands to the floor and at the
E24 1210 same time kick the right foot up in back. The left will follow at
E24 1220 once. The right will land first, followed by the left. Return to the
E24 1230 standing position. Care should be taken to see that the hands are placed
E24 1240 on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot
E24 1250 is brought as close to the hands as possible. This will prevent flat
E24 1260 falls and toe injuries. Bare feet are better for such work than any
E24 1270 form of slipper. Eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough
E24 1280 so that the teacher can catch the leading leg. The child should
E24 1290 then bring both legs together overhead, point the toes and tighten the
E24 1300 seat muscles. Be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the
E24 1310 hands and that only one foot lands at a time. #BACKBENDS# The backbend
E24 1320 is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics, and,
E24 1330 as with all acrobatics, the sooner begun the better the results. Have
E24 1340 the class lie supine with knees apart and bent. Place flat palms on
E24 1350 either side of the head a few inches away from the ears, <fingers pointing
E24 1360 toward the shoulders>. Arch the back upwards to make a bridge.
E24 1370 Be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor
E24 1380 rather than toward the ceiling. As flexibility improves, the feet will
E24 1390 move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher. Later this can
E24 1400 be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover. #BACK CIRCLE#
E24 1410 To further increase back flexibility, work on the back circle. Have
E24 1420 the class lie prone. Place the hands in front of the chest. Keep
E24 1430 the legs straight and the toes pointed. Straighten the arms slowly,
E24 1440 this arches the back. At the peak of the arch, tip the head back and
E24 1450 bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head. Improvement can be
E24 1460 measured by the lessening distance between toes and head. #SOMERSAULTS#
E24 1470 The last essential to the beginner's gymnastic program is the
E24 1480 somersault, or forward roll. This used to be part of every child's
E24 1490 bag of tricks, but few children can do it today; some are actually
E24 1500 incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting
E24 1510 or standing upright. For most small children, learning a forward
E24 1520 roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can. After it has
E24 1530 been seen, have the child start on a mat on hands and knees (a thin,
E24 1540 inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require
E24 1550 falling). He places the hands on either side of the head, keeping
E24 1560 the chin down on the chest. He then pushes his seat into the air and
E24 1570 the teacher guides it over. One or two practice runs should be sufficient
E24 1580 for solo. If, however, the child is weak, overweight, or afraid,
E24 1590 more help will be needed. When the child raises his seat into the air,
E24 1600 the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis; then no matter
E24 1610 what happens, the child's performance will be controlled. By lifting
E24 1620 the seat upwards a little, the weight is taken off the neck and
E24 1630 the back is kept rounded.   These are beginnings, but correctly
E24 1640 learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed
E24 1650 by a strong, flexible body (we are not talking of eccentric extremes).
E24 1660 Even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal, the good tumbler
E24 1670 will be a better dancer, a better athlete, and a human being with
E24 1680 a greater margin of safety in any activity.   It is very important
E24 1690 for parents to understand that early training is imperative. And dancing
E24 1700 school, so helpful in artistic and psychological development, also
E24 1710 contributes to this essential early training- and can contribute
E24 1720 even more.
E25 0010    EVERY taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual
E25 0011 defense
E25 0020 budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion
E25 0030 of these expenditures go for military electronics. We have noted how
E25 0040 some electronic techniques, developed for the defense effort, have evenutally
E25 0050 been used in commerce and industry. The host of novel applications
E25 0060 of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because
E25 0070 of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality.
E25 0080    When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment,
E25 0090 the prospect is staggering. The author has recently studied
E25 0100 the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that, in this
E25 0110 area alone, the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities.
E25 0120 The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be
E25 0130 greater by far than any previous medical discovery. We use the term
E25 0140 "bio-medicine" because of the close interrelation between biology
E25 0150 and medical research.   Electronics has been applied to medicine
E25 0160 for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine,
E25 0170 the electrocardiograph, and the diathermy machine. Recently many
E25 0180 doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage
E25 0190 of bruises,
E25 0200 contusions, and simple bursitis.   Commonly used electronic
E25 0210 devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit
E25 0220 ~TV and audio systems for internal paging and instruction,
E25 0230 along with radiation counters, timers, and similar devices.
E25 0240    In this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application
E25 0250 of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this
E25 0260 is where tomorrow's commonplace equipment originates. From the wealth
E25 0270 of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques
E25 0280 perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which
E25 0290 appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely
E25 0300 new tools in medical research. #ULTRAVIOLET MICROSCOPY#
E25 0310 Many cells, bacteria, and other microorganisms are transparent to visible
E25 0320 light and must be stained for microscopic investigation. This stain
E25 0330 often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside.
E25 0340 A completely new insight into living cells and their structure
E25 0350 will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light
E25 0360 with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-~TV
E25 0370 system to view the results.   Fig& 1 is a simplified block
E25 0380 diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the Medical
E25 0390 Electronics Center of Rockefeller Institute. By combining the
E25 0400 talents of a medical man, Dr& Aterman, a biophysicist, Mr&
E25 0401 Berkely,
E25 0410 and an electronics expert, Dr& Zworykin, this novel technique
E25 0420 has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding
E25 0430 life processes.   Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet
E25 0440 radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the
E25 0450 three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources.
E25 0460 These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the
E25 0470 rotating mirror; the specimen is magnified by the microscope. Instead
E25 0480 of the observer's eye the image orthicon in the ~TV camera
E25 0490 does the "looking". The microscope and orthicon are both selected
E25 0500 to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum, which means that all
E25 0510 lenses must be quartz.   The video signal is amplified and then
E25 0520 switched, in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which
E25 0530 are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of
E25 0540 a second only one wavelength, corresponding to red, green, or blue, is
E25 0550 seen. (Note: Because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source
E25 0560 to another, the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated
E25 0570 by a synchronous motor. This assembly also supplies a 20-~cps
E25 0580 switching gate for the electronics circuitry.) This is the same system
E25 0590 as was used in the field-sequential color-~TV system which preceded
E25 0600 the present simultaneous system. Three separate amplifiers then
E25 0610 drive a 21-inch tricolor tube. The result is a color picture of the
E25 0620 specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet
E25 0630 wavelengths.   Many of the cells and microorganisms which
E25 0640 are transparent to visible light, absorb or reflect the much shorter
E25 0670 wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum. Different parts of these cells
E25 0680 sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often
E25 0690 possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color.
E25 0700 Where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows
E25 0710 or nothing at all, ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation
E25 0720 into a color ~TV picture reveal a wealth of detail.   At the
E25 0730 present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is
E25 0740 primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it. #BREATHING-
E25 0750 ELECTRONICALLY ANALYZED# The medical title of "Lobar Ventilation
E25 0760 in Man" by Drs& C& J& Martin and A& C& Young, covers
E25 0770 a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics
E25 0780 to the study of the respiratory process. At the University
E25 0790 of Washington Medical School, the electronics group has developed
E25 0800 the "Respiratory Gas Analyzer" shown in Fig& 3. This unit,
E25 0810 affectionately dubbed "The Monster", can be wheeled to any convenient
E25 0820 location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's
E25 0830 breathing.   In the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder
E25 0840 indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper
E25 0850 and lower lobes of one lung, the total volume of inhalation per breath,
E25 0860 the flow of air from both lobes, and the pressure of the two lobes
E25 0870 with respect to each other. Usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece
E25 0880 while walking a treadmill, standing still, or in some other medically
E25 0890 significant position. From the resulting data the doctor can determine
E25 0900 lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail. #HEART-MEASURING
E25 0910 TECHNIQUES# The original electrocardiograph primarily
E25 0920 indicates irregularities in the heartbeat, but today's techniques allow
E25 0930 exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta, dimensioning
E25 0940 of the heart and its chambers, and a much more detailed study of
E25 0950 each heartbeat. For many of these measurements the chest must be opened,
E25 0960 but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed.
E25 0970    A group of researchers at the University of Washington have given
E25 0980 a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques. One simple
E25 0990 method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber
E25 1000 tube, filled with mercury, around the heart and record the change
E25 1010 in resistance as the tube is stretched. A balanced resistance bridge
E25 1020 and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed.
E25 1030    Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing
E25 1040 small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel
E25 1050 and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy. The travel
E25 1060 time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second thus it takes
E25 1061 about 16
E25 1070 |msec& to traverse 25 mm& of tissue. A sonar or radar-type
E25 1080 of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for
E25 1090 body-tissue evaluation. In addition to the heart and aorta, successful
E25 1100 measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique.
E25 1110 The Doppler effect, using ultrasonic signals, can be employed to
E25 1120 measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel.
E25 1130    A still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining
E25 1140 the effective power of the heart itself. It uses both an ultrasonic
E25 1150 dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor
E25 1160 inserted into the bloodstream. The latter measures the heat carried
E25 1170 away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood
E25 1180 flow. It is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer, mounted
E25 1190 at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left
E25 1200 ventricle, to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself. This pressure
E25 1210 measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning
E25 1220 measurement is made. A simplified version of the instrumentation
E25 1230 for this procedure is shown in Fig& 2. Outputs of the two
E25 1240 systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge,
E25 1250 followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder.
E25 1260 From this doctors can read heart rate, change in diameter, pressure,
E25 1270 and effective heart power. #RADIO-TRANSMITTER PILLS# Several
E25 1280 years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule
E25 1290 which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal
E25 1300 pressure data to external receivers. This original capsule contained
E25 1310 a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm& in
E25 1320 diameter. Battery life limited the use of this "pill" to about 8
E25 1330 to 30 hours maximum.   A refinement of this technique has been described
E25 1340 by Drs& Zworykin and Farrar and Mr& Berkely of the Medical
E25 1350 Electronics Center of the Rockefeller Institute. In this
E25 1360 novel arrangement the "pill" is much smaller and contains only a resonant
E25 1370 circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing
E25 1380 transducer. As shown in Fig& 4, an external antenna is placed over
E25 1390 or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc&
E25 1400 bursts. The energy received by the "pill" causes the resonant
E25 1410 circuit to "ring" on after the burst and this "ringing" takes
E25 1420 place at the resonant frequency of the "pill". These frequencies
E25 1430 are amplified and detected by the ~FM receiver after each burst
E25 1440 of transmitted energy and, after the "pill" has been calibrated,
E25 1450 precise internal pressure indications can be obtained.   One of
E25 1460 the advantages of this method is that the "pill" can remain in the
E25 1470 patient for several days, permitting observation under natural conditions.
E25 1480 Applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are
E25 1490 planned for future experiments. #SONAR IN MEDICAL RESEARCH# One
E25 1500 of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine
E25 1510 detection is in the exploration of the human body. Our readers
E25 1520 are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent
E25 1530 out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects. Various
E25 1540 methods of pulsing, scanning, and displaying these sound waves are used
E25 1550 to detect submarines, map ocean floors, and even communicate under water.
E25 1560 In medicine the frequencies are much higher, transducers and the
E25 1570 sonar beams themselves are much smaller, and different scanning techniques
E25 1580 may be used, but the principles involved are the same as in sonar.
E25 1590    Because the body contains so much liquid, transmission of
E25 1600 ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels.
E25 1610 Bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic
E25 1620 signals. Based on this phenomenon, a number of investigators have used
E25 1630 this method to "look through" human organs. A good example of
E25 1640 the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers
E25 1650 presented by Dr& G& Baum who has explored the human eye. He
E25 1660 can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate
E25 1670 blindness due to glaucoma. The method used to scan the eye ultrasonically
E25 1680 is illustrated in Fig& 6. The transducer is coupled to the
E25 1690 body through a water bath, not shown. For display, Dr& Baum uses
E25 1700 a portion of an **f, an airborne radar indicator, and then photographs
E25 1710 the screen to obtain a permanent record.   A typical "sonogram"
E25 1720 of a human eye, together with a description of the anatomical
E25 1730 parts, is shown in Fig& 5. The frequency used for these experiments
E25 1740 is 15 mc& and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy
E25 1750 lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter.
E25 1760 The transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan, just like
E25 1770 a radar antenna, while the entire transducer structure is moved over a
E25 1780 90-degree arc in front of the eye to "look into" all corners.
E25 1781 The total
E25 1790 picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector
E25 1800 scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period.   Drs&
E25 1801 Howry
E25 1810 and Holmes at the University of Colorado Medical School have applied
E25 1820 the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have
E25 1830 obtained extremely good results. By submerging the patient in a tub
E25 1840 and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on, they have been
E25 1850 able to get cross-section views of the neck, as shown in Fig& 7, as
E25 1860 well as many other hitherto impossible insights. As mentioned before,
E25 1870 bone reflects the sound energy and in Fig& 7 the portion of the
E25 1880 spine shows as the black area in the center. Arteries and veins are apparent
E25 1890 by their black, blood-filled centers and the surrounding white
E25 1900 walls.   A cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in
E25 1910 Fig& 8 with the various parts labeled.
E26 0010    OERSTED'S boyhood represented a minimal chance of either
E26 0020 attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a
E26 0030 span of life. He was born in the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on
E26 0040 the island of Langeland in the south-central part of Denmark on August
E26 0050 14, 1777. His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender
E26 0060 income made it difficult to feed his family, let alone educate
E26 0070 them in a town without even a school. The two older boys, Hans and Anders,
E26 0080 his junior by a year, therefore went daily to the home of a
E26 0081 warm
E26 0090 and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German; his wife
E26 0100 taught the two boys to read and write Danish. Other brothers later joined
E26 0110 them for instruction with Oldenburg, the wigmaker, and also arithmetic
E26 0120 was added to Bible reading, German, and Danish in the informal
E26 0130 curriculum. Oldenburg's contributions were soon exhausted and the
E26 0140 boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town's learned, such as
E26 0150 the pastor, to supplement the simple teaching. From the town surveyor,
E26 0160 Hans learned drawing and mathematics and, from a university student,
E26 0170 some academic subjects. The mayor of the town taught them English
E26 0180 and French. Whatever Hans or Anders learned separately they passed
E26 0190 on to each other; they read every book that they could borrow in the
E26 0200 village. At 12, Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in
E26 0210 the apothecary shop, which helped stimulate his interest in medicine
E26 0220 and science. His earlier love for literature and history remained with
E26 0230 him for his entire life.   In 1793 the brothers decided to enter
E26 0240 the University of Copenhagen (founded in 1479) and the following
E26 0250 spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the
E26 0260 autumn session. While Hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine,
E26 0270 physics, and astronomy, his brother studied law. The brothers continued
E26 0280 to help each other during their studies, sharing a joint purse,
E26 0290 lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of
E26 0300 their aunt. They supplemented their income by small government assistance,
E26 0310 by tutoring and economizing wherever they could. So impressive
E26 0320 were those serious years of study at the university that Hans later
E26 0330 wrote, "to be perfectly free, the young man must revel in the great
E26 0340 kingdom of thought and imagination; there is a struggle there, in which,
E26 0350 if he falls, it is easy for him to rise again, there is freedom
E26 0360 of utterance there, which draws after it no irreparable consequences on
E26 0370 society **h. I lived in this onward-driving contest where each day
E26 0380 overcame a new difficulty, gained a new truth, or banished a previous
E26 0390 error". He openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing
E26 0400 about science. In this third year at the university, Hans, in 1797,
E26 0410 was awarded the first important token of recognition, a gold medal for
E26 0420 his essay on "Limits of Poetry and Prose". He completed his training
E26 0430 in pharmacy also, taking his degree with high honors in 1797,
E26 0440 and in 1799 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy along with
E26 0450 a prize for an essay in medicine. He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis
E26 0460 which later was accepted in chemical practices. #FERMENT OF SCIENTIFIC
E26 0470 ACTIVITY# HAN'S STUDENT DAYS were at a time when Europe
E26 0480 was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America
E26 0490 and in France, Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms
E26 0500 and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the
E26 0510 Continent.   The new century opened with Oersted beginning
E26 0520 his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen
E26 0530 and as lecturer at the university. He was stirred by the announcement
E26 0540 of Volta's
E26 0550 discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied
E26 0560 the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis. The following
E26 0570 year he devoted to the customary "Wanderjahr", traveling in
E26 0580 Germany, France, and the Netherlands, meeting the philosophers Schelling,
E26 0590 Fichte, and Tieck. He also met Count Rumford (born Benjamin
E26 0600 Thompson in Woburn, Mass&) who was then serving the Elector
E26 0610 of Bavaria, and the physicist Ritter; these were Oersted's main
E26 0620 contacts in science.   From Go^ttingen (1801) where he stayed
E26 0630 for 10 days, he wrote, "The first question asked everywhere is
E26 0640 about galvanism. As everybody is curious to see the battery of glass
E26 0650 tubes I have invented, I have had quite a small one made here of
E26 0651 four glass
E26 0660 tubes (in Copenhagen I used 30) and intend to carry it with me".
E26 0670 Oersted joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks, continuing
E26 0680 their correspondence after he left. With Ritter he was exposed
E26 0690 to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host's
E26 0700 fertile but disorganized mind. Oersted remodeled Ritter's notes
E26 0710 into an essay in French which was submitted to the Institut de France
E26 0720 for its annual prize of 3,000 francs. The sound discoveries of
E26 0730 this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize
E26 0740 was never awarded to him. In May, 1803, Ritter, in another flight
E26 0750 of fancy, wrote to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy.
E26 0760 He related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and
E26 0770 indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided
E26 0780 with the years of important electrical discoveries. Thus, 1745 corresponded
E26 0790 to the invention of the "Leiden" jar by Kleist, 1764
E26 0800 that of the electrophorus by Wilcke, 1782 produced the condenser of
E26 0810 Volta, and 1801 the voltaic pile. Ritter proceeded, "You now emerge
E26 0820 into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820, you will have
E26 0830 to reckon. This we might well witness". Ritter died in 1810 and
E26 0840 Oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of
E26 0850 it.   In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for
E26 0860 the university's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably
E26 0870 considered more a philosopher than a physicist. However, he continued
E26 0880 experimenting and lecturing, publishing the results of his experiments
E26 0890 in German and Danish periodicals. In 1806 his ambition was
E26 0900 realized and he became professor of physics at the Copenhagen University,
E26 0910 though not realizing full professorship (ordinarius) until 1817.
E26 0920    During Oersted's attendance at the university, it was poorly
E26 0930 equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences.
E26 0940 He was, however, fortunate in his contact with Prof& J& G&
E26 0950 L& Manthey (1769-1842), teacher of chemistry, who, in addition to
E26 0960 his academic chair, was
E26 0970 also proprietor of the "Lion Pharmacy" in
E26 0980 Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him. Manthey maintained a valuable
E26 0990 collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted's
E26 1000 disposal during and after his graduation. In 1800, Manthey went
E26 1010 abroad and Oersted was appointed manager of the Lion Pharmacy. In
E26 1020 February 1801, Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus
E26 1030 and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates
E26 1040 of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates
E26 1050 of zinc and lead. In the following year, 1803, Oersted, simultaneously
E26 1060 with Davy, discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic
E26 1070 battery more than did salts. Eager as he was to pursue this promising
E26 1080 line, he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy
E26 1090 and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university
E26 1100 that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to "galvanizing".
E26 1110    He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and
E26 1120 thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood. The
E26 1130 university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor
E26 1140 represented the upper social level. His broad interest in literary, political,
E26 1150 and philosophical movements opened many doors to him. His friends
E26 1160 were numerous and their ties to him were strong.   The years
E26 1170 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again, but on this
E26 1180 visit to Berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his
E26 1190 first journey. In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws
E26 1200 of nature in German and this was issued in French translation (Paris,
E26 1210 1813) under the title <Recherches sur l'identite des forces chimiques
E26 1220 et electriques,> a work held in very high esteem by the new
E26 1230 generation
E26 1240 of research chemists. His interest in finding a relationship between
E26 1250 voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated. Chapter
E26 1260 /8, is entitled "On Magnetism" and in it are included such
E26 1270 remarks as, "One has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces
E26 1280 with the electrical forces. The great resemblance between electrical
E26 1290 and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their
E26 1300 laws necessarily would bring about this comparison. It is true, that
E26 1310 nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication;
E26 1320 but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those
E26 1330 depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest
E26 1340 difference **h. The form of galvanic activity is halfway between
E26 1350 the magnetic form and the electrical form. There, forces are more latent
E26 1360 than in electricity, and less than in magnetism **h. But in such
E26 1370 an important question, we would be satisfied if the judgment were that
E26 1380 the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity
E26 1390 and magnetism were only a difficulty, and not a thing which is
E26 1400 contrary to it **h. One could also add to these analogies that steel
E26 1410 loses its magnetism by heat, which proves that steel becomes a better
E26 1420 conductor through a rise in temperature, just as electrical bodies do.
E26 1430 It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature, as
E26 1440 proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb. By that, one feels that magnetic
E26 1450 forces are as general as electrical forces. An attempt should be made
E26 1460 to see if electricity, in its most latent stage, has any action on the
E26 1470 magnet as such". His plan and intent were clearly charted.
E26 1480 Oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and
E26 1490 political discussions. In one debate he supported the freedom of judgment
E26 1500 as opposed to dogma, in another he held that the practice of science
E26 1510 was in fact an act of religious worship. He continued as a popular
E26 1520 lecturer. He devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was
E26 1530 caused to glow by an electric current.   In 1819 under royal command
E26 1540 he undertook a very successful geological expedition to Bornholm,
E26 1550 one of the Danish islands, being one of three scientists in the expedition.
E26 1560 It was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition,
E26 1570 Lauritz Esmarch, that Oersted succeeded in producing light
E26 1580 by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric
E26 1590 current was made to flow. Together they also developed a new
E26 1600 form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of
E26 1610 copper, thereby producing stronger currents. Esmarch was among those
E26 1620 who witnessed Oersted's first demonstration of his discovery. #DISCOVERY
E26 1630 OF ELECTROMAGNETISM# THE ASSOCIATION between electric
E26 1640 (both electrostatic and voltaic) forces and magnetic forces had been
E26 1650 recognized by investigators for many decades. Electrical literature
E26 1660 contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and
E26 1670 had altered the polarity of compass needles. In the late 1700's
E26 1680 Beccaria and van Marum, among others, had magnetized iron by sending
E26 1690 an electrostatic charge through it. Beccaria had almost stumbled on
E26 1700 a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge
E26 1710 from a Leyden jar was sent <transversally> through a piece
E26 1720 of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic. The resulting magnetic
E26 1730 effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise.
E26 1740 The experiments of Romagnosi and others have already been noted but
E26 1750 no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these
E26 1760 two primary forces. Oersted's own earlier experiments were unimpressive,
E26 1770 possibly because he had, like other experimenters, laid the conducting
E26 1780 wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it.
E26 1790    The sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains
E26 1800 ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the
E26 1810 university related that the first direct event that led to the publication
E26 1820 of Oersted's discovery occurred during a private lecture made
E26 1830 before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820. At
E26 1840 this lecture Oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel
E26 1850 to a magnetic needle.
E27 0010 Knowing <specifically> what the many feed additives can do and

E27 1690 There are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle:
E27 1700 (1) Fence-line bunks- cattle eat from one side while feed
E27 1710 is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons;
E27 1720 (2) Mechanized bunks- they sit within the feed lot, are filled
E27 1730 by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface; (3) Special bunks-
E27 1740 as discussed here, they permit cattle to eat from all sides. Feed is
E27 1750 put in with an elevator.   Several materials or combinations of
E27 1760 materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk. The selection
E27 1770 of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation,
E27 1780 cost of materials available locally, and your own preference. No
E27 1790 one material is best for all situations. Selecting bunks by economic
E27 1800 comparison is usually an individual problem. #FENCE-LINE FEEDING.#
E27 1810 Animals eat only from one side, so the fence-line bunk must be twice
E27 1820 as long as the mechanical bunk. These bunks also serve as a fence,
E27 1830 so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence. Because
E27 1840 of their location, on the edge of the feed lot, fence-line bunks are
E27 1850 not in the way of mechanical manure removal. Filling these bunks by
E27 1860 the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the
E27 1870 wagons over more time and operations.   All-weather roads must
E27 1880 be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all
E27 1890 year. This will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall.
E28 0010 MARKETING in the new decade will be no picnic- for the sixties
E28 0020 will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you
E28 0030 have experienced in the last 20-25 yr&.   Why? Companies of
E28 0040 all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies-
E28 0050 in modern equipment and new processes, enlarged ~R+D
E28 0060 facilities, faster new product development. Many companies have upgraded
E28 0070 their sales manpower and tested new selling, distribution, and promotion
E28 0080 techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge.   Given this
E28 0090 kind of business climate, what competitive marketing problems will your
E28 0100 company face in the next 10 yr&? Based on our experience with
E28 0110 clients, we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups-
E28 0120 the market place itself, marketing methods, and marketing management.
E28 0130 #1. PROBLEMS IN THE MARKET# _@ GREATER PRICE-CONSCIOUSNESS._
E28 0140 There has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent
E28 0150 years; there is every indication it will continue. Frequently, wittingly
E28 0160 or unwittingly, price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers,
E28 0170 distributors, and dealers. Despite generally good levels of
E28 0180 income, we see greater price pressures than ever before- traveling
E28 0190 back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer.
E28 0200    Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy
E28 0210 will be on target:   Has the probable price situation in
E28 0220 your field been forecast as a basis for future planning? Have cost
E28 0230 studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might
E28 0240 be done if things get worse? Have you actually checked out (not
E28 0250 just mentally tested) different selling approaches designed to counter
E28 0260 the price competition problem? _@ INCREASED CUSTOMER SOPHISTICATION._
E28 0270 Average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding
E28 0280 product and advertising claims, partly because of widespread criticism
E28 0290 of such assertions. This problem can force a change in marketing approach
E28 0300 in many kinds of businesses. Have you examined this problem of
E28 0310 increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company?
E28 0320 _@ GREATER DEMAND FOR SERVICES._ Need for service is here
E28 0330 to stay- and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the
E28 0340 sixties. There are two reasons for this. First, most products tend to
E28 0350 become more complex. Second, in a competitive market, the customer
E28 0360 feels his weight and throws it around.   {Providing good customer
E28 0370 service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning
E28 0380 job as the original selling of the product}. Too often it is
E28 0390 thought of at the last moment of new product introduction.   Good
E28 0400 service starts with product design and planning: Many products seem
E28 0410 to be designed for a production economy, not for a service one. Proper
E28 0420 follow-through requires training your own sales organization, and
E28 0430 your distributor organizations, not only in the techniques but also
E28 0440 in good customer relations.   Have you assessed the importance of
E28 0450 service and given it proper attention? _@ WIDER DISCRETIONARY
E28 0460 CHOICES FOR CUSTOMERS._ In spending his money today, the consumer is
E28 0470 pulled in many directions. To the manufacturer of the more convenient-type
E28 0480 product- the purchase of which can be switched, delayed, or
E28 0490 put off entirely- the implications are important. Your competition
E28 0500 is now proportionately greater- you are competing not only against manufacturers
E28 0510 in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers
E28 0520 of other appealing consumer products.   Many industry trade
E28 0530 associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share
E28 0540 of the consumer's dollar being spent on their particular products.
E28 0550 Has your company thought through its strategy in this whole "discretionary
E28 0560 buying" area? _@ GEOGRAPHIC SHIFT OF CUSTOMERS._
E28 0570 The trends have been in evidence for many years- population shifts
E28 0580 to the Southwest and Far West, and from city to suburbs. These shifts
E28 0590 will continue in the next 10 yr&. Have you considered the implications
E28 0600 of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation,
E28 0610 strength of distributor organizations, and even plant location?
E28 0620 _@ MARKET CONCENTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION IN FEWER ACCOUNTS._ We
E28 0630 have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions
E28 0640 in the food industry- at both the manufacturing and retail ends.
E28 0650 Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts, there are now larger
E28 0660 sales to or through fewer accounts.   The change may require
E28 0670 different products, pricing, packaging, warehousing, salesmanship, advertising
E28 0680 and executive attention- practically every link in the marketing
E28 0690 network may have to be adjusted. Have you examined these trends,
E28 0700 forecast the effects, and planned your marketing strategy to compete
E28 0710 effectively under changing circumstances? #2. PROBLEMS IN MARKETING
E28 0720 METHODS# _@ MORE PRIVATE LABEL COMPETITION._ In the area
E28 0730 of private label competition, it is logical to expect a continuation of
E28 0740 trends which have been under way during the first decade. As mass dealer
E28 0750 and distributor organizations grow in size, there is every reason
E28 0760 to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer's as well as the
E28 0770 distributor's profits- which is, in effect, what the sale of private
E28 0780 brands tends to do.   {Average manufacturer frequently has
E28 0790 helped build private brand business, delivering largely the same qualities
E28 0800 and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded}. Moreover,
E28 0810 the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain
E28 0820 stores have insisted on high quality- and the customer seems to have
E28 0830 caught on.   If you are up against private brand competition,
E28 0840 have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening
E28 0850 your market position? If private brand competition hasn't been
E28 0860 felt in your product field as yet, have you thought how you will cope
E28 0870 with it if and when it does appear? _@ LESS PERSONAL SALESMANSHIP._
E28 0880 Display merchandising, backed by pre-selling through advertising
E28 0890 and promotion, will continue to make strides in the sixties. It
E28 0900 has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program.
E28 0910    How can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet
E28 0920 and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are
E28 0930 still important? If you have a higher-quality product, how can you
E28 0940 make it stand out- justify its premium price- without the spoken
E28 0950 word? Salesmanship is still necessary, but it's a different brand
E28 0960 of salesmanship.   Have you carefully examined the selling techniques
E28 0970 which best suit your products? Have you studied the caliber
E28 0980 and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements
E28 0990 for effective marketing? Are you experimenting with different selling
E28 1000 slants in developing new customers? _@ HIGHER COSTS OF DISTRIBUTION
E28 1010 GENERALLY._ Some distribution costs are kept up by competitive
E28 1020 pressure, some by the fact that the customers have come to expect
E28 1030 certain niceties and flourishes. {No manufacturer has taken the initiative
E28 1040 in pointing out the costs involved}.   The use of bulk
E28 1050 handling is continuously growing. Computers are being used to keep branch
E28 1060 inventories at more workable levels. "Selective selling"-
E28 1080 concentrating sales on the larger accounts- has been used effectively
E28 1090 by some manufacturers.   There may be possible economies at any
E28 1100 one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain. Do
E28 1110 you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully-
E28 1120 and with some imagination? In your sales force, will a
E28 1130 smaller number of higher-priced, high-quality salesmen serve you best,
E28 1140 or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen?
E28 1150    Will your trade customers settle for less attention and
E28 1160 fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share? In one company
E28 1170 covering the country with a high-quality sales force of 10 men, the
E28 1180 president personally phones each major account every 6 mos&. As a
E28 1190 result, distribution costs were cut, customer relations improved.
E28 1200    Distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties-
E28 1210 and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study
E28 1220 each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job.
E28 1230 _@ HIGHER COSTS OF ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION._ From the manufacturer's
E28 1240 point of view, the increasing cost of advertising and promotion
E28 1250 is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties. It is accentuated
E28 1260 by the need for pre-selling goods, and private label competition.
E28 1270    How much fundamental thinking and research has your company
E28 1280 done on its advertising program? Are you following competition willy-nilly-
E28 1290 trying to match dollar for dollar- or are you experimenting
E28 1300 with new means for reaching and influencing consumers? Have you
E28 1310 evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion
E28 1320 in your total marketing program- from the standpoint of effort, money,
E28 1330 and effectiveness? _@ INCREASING TEMPO OF NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT._
E28 1340 Practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products
E28 1350 on the horizon. Will you be out in the market place with some of these
E28 1360 sales-building new products?   If competition beats you to it,
E28 1370 this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store. On
E28 1380 the other hand, the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing
E28 1390 the new one is usually mighty expensive. As markets become larger
E28 1400 and marketing more complex, the costs of an error become progressively
E28 1410 larger.   Is your ~R+D or product development program tuned
E28 1420 in to the commercial realities of the market? Are there regular communications
E28 1430 from the field, or meetings of sales and marketing personnel
E28 1440 with ~R+D people? {Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing,
E28 1450 but it's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register}.
E28 1460    Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd
E28 1470 a new product through to commercialization; who can develop reliable
E28 1480 estimates of sales volume, production, and distribution costs; and
E28 1500 translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which
E28 1510 management can act on with some assurance? We have seen good new
E28 1520 products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts
E28 1530 and plans- and management couldn't make up its mind. #3. PROBLEMS
E28 1540 IN MARKETING MANAGEMENT# _@ SHORTAGE OF SKILLED SALESMEN._
E28 1550 There is a shortage of salesmen today. In the future, quantitative
E28 1560 demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy, and
E28 1570 the qualitative need will be greater still.   While many companies
E28 1580 have done fine work in developing sales personnel, much of it has been
E28 1590 product rather than sales training. Nor has the training been enough
E28 1600 in relation to the need. Most marketing people agree it is going
E28 1610 to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements.   Have
E28 1620 you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future (both quantitatively
E28 1630 and qualitatively)? Has your company developed selection and
E28 1640 training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen
E28 1650 you will need in the next 10 yr&? _@ SHORTAGE OF SALES MANAGEMENT
E28 1660 TALENT._ With the growing complexity of markets and intensity
E28 1670 of competition, sales management, whether at the district, region or
E28 1680 headquarters level, is a tough job today- and it will be tougher in
E28 1690 the future. Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager
E28 1700 are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications
E28 1710 called for by this type of management work. The growth of business
E28 1720 has outdistanced the available supply, and the demand will continue to
E28 1730 exceed the supply in the sixties.   Does your company have a program
E28 1740 for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel
E28 1750 for the longer term? Does your management climate and your management
E28 1760 compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people?
E28 1770 _@ COMPLEXITY OF COMPLETE MARKETING PLANNING._ Every single
E28 1780 problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning. "Hip-pocket"
E28 1790 tactics are going to be harder to apply. Many food and
E28 1800 beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis. They have
E28 1810 to be. With greater investments in plant facilities, with automation
E28 1820 growing, you can't switch around, either in volume or in product
E28 1830 design, as much as was formerly possible- or at least not as economically.
E28 1840    Are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently
E28 1850 in your company? We find too many sales and marketing executives
E28 1860 so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning.
E28 1870    Are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management
E28 1880 group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the
E28 1890 marketing team? Do you have a long-term (5- or 10-yr&) marketing
E28 1900 program?   The key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining
E28 1910 your company's marketing problems realistically. Solutions
E28 1920 frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems,
E28 1930 whether they be in the market, in marketing methods or in marketing
E28 1940 management.   If companies will take the time to give objective
E28 1950 consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke,
E28 1960 then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective
E28 1970 marketing in next decade.
E29 0010 The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior
E29 0020 designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought
E29 0030 clearly into focus one important difference of opinion. The architects
E29 0040 do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently
E29 0050 good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect
E29 0060 and that, therefore, the interior designer is incapable of understanding
E29 0070 the architectural principles involved in planning the interior
E29 0080 of a building.   Ordinary politeness may have militated against
E29 0090 this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance
E29 0100 in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables, workshops
E29 0110 or panel discussions- whatever they are called- on this subject
E29 0120 will recognize that the final, boiled down crux of the matter is
E29 0130 education.   It is true that most architectural schools have five
E29 0140 year courses, some even have six or more. The element of public danger
E29 0150 which enters so largely into architectural certification, however,
E29 0160 would demand a prolonged study of structure. This would, naturally,
E29 0170 lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior
E29 0180 designer's training.   We may then dismiss the time difference
E29 0190 between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior
E29 0200 design student as not having serious bearing on the subject. The
E29 0210 real question that follows is- how are those four years used and what
E29 0220 is their value as training?   The American Institute of Interior
E29 0230 Designers has published a recommended course for designers and
E29 0240 a percentage layout of such a course. An examination of some forty
E29 0250 catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design, for the most
E29 0260 part schools accredited by membership in the National Association of
E29 0270 Schools of Art, and a further "on the spot" inspection of a number
E29 0280 of schools, show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations.
E29 0290 One or two of the schools have a five year curriculum, but
E29 0300 the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to
E29 0310 the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions.
E29 0320    The suggested course of the A&I&D& was based
E29 0330 on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to
E29 0340 curricular necessities. Obviously, the four year provision limits this
E29 0350 to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated.
E29 0360    Without comparing the relative merits of the two courses- architecture
E29 0370 versus interior design- let us examine the educational needs
E29 0380 of the interior designer.   To begin with, what is an interior
E29 0390 designer? "The Dictionary of Occupational Titles" published
E29 0400 by the U& S& Department of Labor describes him as follows: "Designs,
E29 0410 plans and furnishes interiors of houses, commercial and institutional
E29 0420 structures, hotels, clubs, ships, theaters, as well as set
E29 0430 decorations for motion picture arts and television. Makes drawings and
E29 0440 plans of rooms showing placement of furniture, floor coverings, wall
E29 0450 decorations, and determines color schemes.   Furnishes complete
E29 0460 cost estimates for clients approval. Makes necessary purchases, places
E29 0470 contracts, supervises construction, installation, finishing and placement
E29 0480 of furniture, fixtures and other correlated furnishings, and follows
E29 0490 through to completion of project".   In addition to this
E29 0500 the U& S& Civil Service Bureau, when examining applicants for
E29 0510 government positions as interior designers, expects that "when various
E29 0520 needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them.
E29 0530 He must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture
E29 0540 of any craft materials needed in the furnishings".   This
E29 0550 seems like a large order. The interior designer, then, must first be
E29 0560 an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and
E29 0570 plumbing and finance. Yet nobody will question the necessity of all this
E29 0580 and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice
E29 0590 it. And further he must understand his obligation to the client
E29 0600 to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve
E29 0610 his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society.
E29 0620    Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording
E29 0630 of their curriculum. It is in the quality of the teaching of all this
E29 0640 that a question may arise.   The old established independent art
E29 0650 schools try their best to fulfill their obligations. Yet even here
E29 0660 many a problem is presented; as in a recent design competition with
E29 0670 a floor plan and the simple command- "design a luxury apartment";
E29 0680 no description of the client or his cultural level, no assertion of
E29 0690 geographical area or local social necessities- simply "a luxury
E29 0700 apartment". Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only
E29 0710 in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may
E29 0720 please the public relations department but have little to do with the
E29 0730 essence of interior design.   It is possible, of course, to work
E29 0740 on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will
E29 0750 explain their necessities so that the student may get "the feel"
E29 0760 of real interior design demands. Unfortunately, the purely synthetic
E29 0770 problem is the rule.   It is like medical schools in India where,
E29 0780 in that fairy-land of religious inhibition, the dissection of dead
E29 0790 bodies is frowned upon. Instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs
E29 0800 of plants. Thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense
E29 0810 of actual experience.   In the earlier years of training certain
E29 0820 phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its
E29 0830 use. But to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable.
E29 0840    Consultation with architects, clients, real estate men,
E29 0850 fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development
E29 0860 of class problems just as in actual work. Fortunately, although
E29 0870 only a few years ago they held the student at arms length, today
E29 0880 the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student, not only
E29 0890 from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from
E29 0900 the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of
E29 0910 tomorrow- that the student already is "in the trade".   Even
E29 0920 the "history of furniture" can hardly be taught exclusively from
E29 0930 photographs and lantern slides. Here, too, the reality of actual furniture
E29 0940 must be experienced.   The professional organizations such
E29 0950 as American Institute of Interior Designers, National Society
E29 0960 of Interior Designers, Home Fashions League and various trade associations,
E29 0970 can and do aid greatly in this work. Certainly every educator
E29 0980 involved in interior design should be a member and active in thework
E29 0990 of one of these organizations.   Not only should every educator
E29 1000 above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of
E29 1010 the professional organizations, but his first qualification for membership
E29 1015 as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership
E29 1020 would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject.
E29 1030    Participation for the educator in this case, however, would have to
E29 1040 be raised to full and complete membership. The largest of these organizations
E29 1050 at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the
E29 1060 conduct and standards of the group and, indeed, refuses him even the
E29 1070 right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog.
E29 1080    This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower
E29 1090 his standing in the eyes of the students. The professor in turn
E29 1100 dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in
E29 1110 the policies and standards of which he has no voice.   This seems
E29 1120 somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications
E29 1130 for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced, the
E29 1140 educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands.
E29 1150    In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to
E29 1160 the schools. That is in the continuance of the "grandfather clauses"
E29 1170 in their membership requirements.   When these groups were
E29 1180 first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have
E29 1190 had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were
E29 1200 rare and
E29 1210 undeveloped during their youth. Long hard years of "on the
E29 1220 job" training had brought them to their competence.   The necessity
E29 1230 of that day has long disappeared. There is plenty of opportunity
E29 1240 for proper education today. It is discouraging for students to realize
E29 1250 that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they
E29 1260 are supposed to stand.   The reason and the day of "grandfather
E29 1270 clauses" has long since passed. No one can deny that these "back
E29 1280 door" admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused
E29 1290 nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents
E29 1300 to membership in supposedly learned societies.   Beyond
E29 1310 any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality
E29 1320 of the teachers themselves. It will occur to anyone that the teacher
E29 1330 must have adequate education, a depth and breadth of knowledge far
E29 1340 beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication
E29 1350 to his subject and to his students. The local decorator who rushes
E29 1360 in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these
E29 1370 qualifications.   Nor will the hack, the Jack-of-all-trades, still
E29 1380 found in some of the smaller art schools, suffice.   Only a
E29 1390 few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher
E29 1400 of interior design. At the end of its letter was the information
E29 1410 that applicants for this position "must also be prepared to teach costume
E29 1420 design and advertising art". This kind of irresponsibility toward
E29 1430 their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude
E29 1440 in the future designer.   We must build a corp of highly professional
E29 1450 teachers of interior design who have had education, experience
E29 1460 in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments
E29 1470 of teaching- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres.
E29 1480    Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture,
E29 1490 furniture design, textiles and color is also desirable.
E29 1500    In all "degree" courses in interior design a number of "academic"
E29 1510 or "general studies" courses are included. It is only fair
E29 1520 to demand that teachers of courses in English, history, psychology
E29 1530 and so on be as well informed in matters of art, especially interior
E29 1540 design, as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects. The
E29 1550 proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only
E29 1560 if this standard is observed. The matter of sympathy of the academic
E29 1570 professors for art objectives also must be taken into account.
E29 1580 One technical question of school organization comes to mind here. For
E29 1590 proper accreditation of schools, teachers in any course must have
E29 1600 a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate.
E29 1610 Since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate
E29 1620 work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed.
E29 1630 Indeed, it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable
E29 1640 schools of art have granted degrees at all. The question, however,
E29 1650 cannot be ignored for long. The basic problem involved is that a college
E29 1660 setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty
E29 1670 for the advanced degree. Most professors in the course must, naturally,
E29 1680 again have a higher degree than the course offers. One solution
E29 1690 is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute.
E29 1700 It is a sort of academic ring-around-a rosy and you solve it.
E29 1710 This brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general.
E29 1720 Only the independent art schools, that is, those not connected
E29 1730 with any university or college, receive severe and separate investigation
E29 1740 before accreditation by the various regional organizations. It has
E29 1750 been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation
E29 1760 for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of
E29 1770 their fine arts department. This, plus the habit of many schools of
E29 1780 simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics
E29 1790 department, yet, nevertheless, claiming that they teach interior
E29 1800 design, has contributed to the low repute of many university courses
E29 1810 in interior design. In spite of this, many universities offer adequate
E29 1820 and even distinguished courses in the subject.   There will be
E29 1830 no mitigation of these offences until all art schools, whether independent
E29 1840 or attached to universities have separate accreditation- as do
E29 1850 medical schools- by an art accreditation group such as the "National
E29 1860 Association of Schools of Art".   Independent art schools
E29 1870 granting degrees must, naturally, follow this with academic accreditation
E29 1880 by the appropriate regional group.

E30 0440 employees?   What are the possibilities for operating your
E30 0450 cafeteria for a single shift only and relying upon vending machines
E30 0460 or prepackaged sandwiches for the second- and third-shift operations?
E30 0470    Have you checked the cost of subcontracting your cafeteria
E30 0480 operation in order to save administrative costs?   Are there
E30 0490 possibilities of having cafeteria help work part-time on custodial or
E30 0500 other jobs?   Can staggered lunch periods relieve the capacity
E30 0510 strain on your feeding facilities?   Would it be feasible to
E30 0520 limit the menu in order to reduce feeding costs?   Have you considered
E30 0530 gradual withdrawal of subsidies to your in-plant feeding operation?
E30 0540    Are you utilizing cafeteria space for company meetings
E30 0550 or discussions? #RECREATION FACILITIES# Are your expenses in
E30 0560 this area commensurate with the number of employees who benefit from
E30 0570 your program?   Have you audited your program recently to weed
E30 0580 out those phases that draw least participation?   Do employees
E30 0590 contribute their share of money to recreational facilities?
E30 0600 Have you considered delegating operational responsibility to your employee
E30 0610 association and carefully restricting your plant's financial
E30 0620 contribution?   Could an employee's garden club take over partial
E30 0630 care of plant grounds? Would a camera club be useful in taking
E30 0640 pictures pertinent to plant safety?   Are you spending too much
E30 0650 money on team uniforms that benefit only a few employees? Are you
E30 0660 underwriting expensive team trips?   Are you utilizing vending
E30 0670 machine proceeds to help pay for your program? #TRANSPORTATION
E30 0680 AND PARKING# Do you know the trend in your cost of maintaining access
E30 0690 roads and parking lots?   If you use parking attendants, can
E30 0700 they be replaced by automatic parking gates?   Will your local
E30 0710 bus company erect and/or maintain the bus stops at your plant?
E30 0720    If you provide inter-plant transportation, can this be replaced
E30 0730 by available public transportation? If you use company transportation
E30 0740 to meet trains or to haul visitors, would taxis be cheaper?
E30 0750    How efficient and necessary are your intra-company vehicles? Can
E30 0760 they be re-scheduled? Can part-time drivers be assigned to other
E30 0770 productive work? #PAID VACATIONS# Which is more economical for
E30 0780 your plant- a vacation shutdown or spaced vacations that require extra
E30 0790 employees for vacation fill-ins?   Can vacations be spaced
E30 0800 throughout the 12 months to minimize the number of employee fill-ins?
E30 0810    Do you insist that unneeded salary employees take their vacations
E30 0820 during plant shutdowns?   What can your sales and purchasing
E30 0830 departments do to curtail orders, shipments, and receipts during vacation
E30 0840 shutdown periods? #RETIREMENT# Is an arbitrary retirement
E30 0850 age of 65 actually costing your plant money?   What sort of
E30 0860 effort do you make to assure that older or disabled workers are fully
E30 0870 productive? Would early retirement of non-productive, disabled employees
E30 0880 reduce the number of make-work jobs?   Will your union
E30 0890 accept seniority concessions in assigning work for older or disabled employees?
E30 0900 #MEDICAL AND HEALTH# Can you share medical facilities
E30 0910 and staff with neighboring plants?   If you have a full-time
E30 0920 doctor now, can he be replaced with a part-time doctor or one who serves
E30 0930 on a fee-per-case basis only?   Can your plant nurse be replaced
E30 0940 by a trained first-aid man who works full-time on some other assignment?
E30 0950    Do you rigidly distinguish between job- and non-job-connected
E30 0960 health problems and avoid treating the latter?   Are
E30 0970 you indiscriminantly offering unnecessary medical services- flu shots,
E30 0980 sun lamp treatments, etc&?   If you have an annual or regular
E30 0990 physical examination program, is it worth what it is costing you?
E30 1000 #A PROGRAM TO FIT YOUR NEEDS# Consider what you can afford
E30 1010 to spend and what your goals are before setting up or revamping your employee
E30 1020 benefit program. Too many plant officials are all too eager to
E30 1030 buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works
E30 1040 for another plant.   But even if that other plant employs the
E30 1050 same number of workers and makes the same product, there are other facts
E30 1060 to consider. How old is your working force? What's your profit
E30 1070 margin? In what section of the country are you located? Are
E30 1080 you in a rural or urban area? These factors can make the difference
E30 1090 between waste and efficiency in any benefit program.   Above all,
E30 1100 don't set up extravagant fringe benefits just to buy employee good
E30 1110 will. Unions stress fringe benefits, but the individual hourly worker
E30 1120 prefers cash every time.   Aim to balance your employee benefit
E30 1130 package. Some plants go overboard on one type of fringe- say a liberal
E30 1140 retirement plan- and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere. They're
E30 1150 asking for union trouble. #COMMUNICATIONS# If you want credit
E30 1160 for your employee services program, let your workers know what they're
E30 1170 entitled to. Encourage them to exercise their benefits. This
E30 1180 can be done by stories in your house organs, posters, special
E30 1185 publications, letters to workers' homes as well as
E30 1190 by word of mouth through your chain of command.   Some companies
E30 1200 find a little imagination helpful. Hallmark Cards, Inc&, Kansas
E30 1210 City, Mo&, has a do-it-yourself quiz game called "Benefit Bafflers",
E30 1220 which it distributes to employees. ~M + ~R Dietetic Laboratories,
E30 1230 Inc&, Columbus, gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook-
E30 1240 each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular
E30 1250 fringe. U& S& Rubber Company, New York, passes out a form
E30 1260 itemizing the value of benefits. The blue-collar worker thus knows
E30 1270 his insurance package, for example, costs $227.72. #INSURANCE# Have
E30 1280 the insurance company or your own accounting department break down
E30 1290 the cost of your insurance package periodically. You may find certain
E30 1300 coverage costing much more than is economically feasible, thereby alerting
E30 1310 you to desirable revisions.   Check to see if some of your
E30 1320 benefits- such as on-the-job disability pay- can be put on a direct
E30 1330 payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you.
E30 1340 Use deductable insurance wherever feasible. It can put an end to marginal
E30 1350 claims which play havoc with your insurance rates. Also, beware
E30 1360 of open-end policies, especially in the medical field. This will mean
E30 1370 that every time there's an increase in hospital rates your cost will
E30 1380 go up in like manner. Put a dollar-and-cents limit on benefits.
E30 1390    Don't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death.
E30 1400 Generally, your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that
E30 1410 protect him during his working life or during retirement. #SPECIAL TIME
E30 1420 OFF# In granting bereavement leaves, specify the maximum time off
E30 1430 and list what the worker's relation to the deceased must be to qualify.
E30 1440 Thus, you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth
E30 1450 cousin's funeral. Also, reserve the right to demand proof of
E30 1460 death despite the fact that you'll probably never use it.   Coffee
E30 1470 breaks can be a real headache if not regulated. Vending machines
E30 1480 can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting
E30 1490 waste of production time. If coffee is sold at the cafeteria,
E30 1500 let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group. Consider
E30 1510 installing supplemental serving lines in production areas. Make
E30 1520 sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers,
E30 1530 if you are supplying the coffee. Otherwise, you may be saddled
E30 1540 with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers. #RETIREMENT POLICIES#
E30 1550 Keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool
E30 1560 and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company.
E30 1570 And so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest
E30 1580 possible age. Make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements
E30 1590 tied into your pension plan. Younger men usually don't think
E30 1600 of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they're
E30 1610 liable to change jobs several times before settling down.   Choose
E30 1620 carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans.
E30 1630 There are two sides of a coin for this decision. Workers usually think
E30 1640 more of a plan they contribute to. And they can at least collect
E30 1650 the money they put in, plus interest, when they leave the company. A
E30 1660 non-contributory plan usually won't pay off for the worker until he
E30 1670 retires. Thus, there is an added incentive to stay on the job. #HOLIDAYS#
E30 1680 Make sure you don't pay for holidays that occur when an employee
E30 1690 would not otherwise be working. These include: leaves of absences,
E30 1700 illnesses, and layoffs.   Consider adopting a system of holidays
E30 1710 in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience
E30 1720 to the operation of the plant. It's usually not too hard to sell
E30 1730 workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods. For example,
E30 1740 the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for Washington's
E30 1750 birthday. This reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and
E30 1760 startups.   Require each employee to work his last shift both
E30 1770 before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay. This cuts the absentee
E30 1780 rate. #EATING FACILITIES# Consider using vending machines
E30 1790 rather than subsidized cafeterias. Latest models serve hot meals at reasonable
E30 1800 prices, and at a profit to you. If a concessionaire runs the
E30 1810 cafeteria, keep an eye out for quality and price. If the soup tastes
E30 1820 like dishwater, your employees won't blame the concessionaire. You'll
E30 1830 take the rap.   Check your cafeteria location to make sure
E30 1840 it's convenient for most employees. You may save valuable production
E30 1850 minutes with a change. #VACATIONS# Spread your vacation period
E30 1860 over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two
E30 1870 weeks. This will cut the expense of vacation replacements. And with
E30 1880 the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice
E30 1890 vacation dates.   Also make sure you have reasonable requirements
E30 1900 as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a
E30 1910 vacation. You might try providing standard vacation time off but make
E30 1920 the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous
E30 1930 year.
E31 0010 THE LONG and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into
E31 0020 a new era. Modern times have changed the world beyond recognition.
E31 0030 The early years of the twentieth century seem very far away. But with
E31 0040 all the changes in philosophy, dress and terrain- a few things remain
E31 0050 constant, including the devotion of Americans to the great field
E31 0060 sports, hunting and fishing.   As the generations move on, clothes
E31 0070 become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports. Sporting
E31 0080 firearms change, markedly for the better. Just as modern transportation
E31 0090 has outmoded the early Studebaker covered wagon, the demand of
E31 0100 today's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment.
E31 0110    The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers through
E31 0120 diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle
E31 0130 loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders,
E31 0140 extremely accurate bolt, lever, and slide action firearms. And
E31 0150 millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition,
E31 0160 designed for today's hunting and target shooting.   And due
E31 0170 to modern resource-use and game management practices, there is still
E31 0180 game to shoot, even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and
E31 0190 water. Present conservation practices regard wildlife, not as an expendable
E31 0200 natural resource, but as an annual harvest to be sown and also
E31 0210 reaped. Unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states,
E31 0220 on shooting preserves (one of the newer phases of modern game-management)
E31 0230 for five and six months each year.   Close to two million
E31 0240 game birds were harvested on 1,500 commercial and private shooting
E31 0250 preserves, and on State Game Commission-controlled upland game areas
E31 0260 during the 1960-61 season. The shooting development program of the
E31 0270 Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute has successfully
E31 0280 published these facts in all major outdoor magazines, many national
E31 0290 weeklies and the trade papers.   The most effective way to
E31 0300 develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly
E31 0310 managed shooting preserves. This has been the aim of the director
E31 0320 of the shooting development program, the New York staff of the Sportsmen's
E31 0330 Service Bureau, and the ~SAAMI shooting preserve
E31 0340 field consultants since the start of the program in 1954.   Following
E31 0350 the kick-off of ~SAAMI's shooting development program
E31 0360 in 1954, a most interesting meeting took place in Washington, D& C&.
E31 0370 The group known as the American Association for Health, Physical
E31 0380 Education, and Recreation (a division of the National Education
E31 0390 Association) initiated a conference which brought together representatives
E31 0400 of the National Rifle Association, ~SAAMI and the American
E31 0410 Fishing Tackle Manufacturers. This meeting was called to
E31 0420 determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as
E31 0430 the Outdoor Education Project.   The Outdoor Education Project
E31 0440 took cognizance of the fact, so often overlooked, that athletic
E31 0450 activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship
E31 0460 to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life. The
E31 0470 various team sports assuredly have their place in every school, and
E31 0480 they are important to proper physical development. But with the exception
E31 0490 of professional athletes, few contact sports and physical education
E31 0500 activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of
E31 0510 the average American man or woman.   Following a vigorous campaign
E31 0520 of interpretation and leadership development by ~OEP director
E31 0530 Dr& Julian Smith, today thousands of secondary schools, colleges
E31 0540 and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical
E31 0550 education and recreation programs. ~SAAMI's financial support
E31 0560 since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education.
E31 0570 Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have
E31 0580 proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops, at which
E31 0590 hundreds of school administrators, teachers, professors, and recreational
E31 0600 leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education. Considering
E31 0610 that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths, the project
E31 0620 and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more
E31 0630 to reach.   In 1959 ~SAAMI's shooting development program
E31 0640 announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys
E31 0650 and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in
E31 0660 the shooting sports. This program is now nationally known as "Teen
E31 0670 Hunter Clubs".   Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored
E31 0680 by affiliated members of the Allied Merchandising Corporation.
E31 0690 The first program was sponsored by Abraham + Strauss, Hempstead, New
E31 0700 York, under the direction of Special Events director Jennings
E31 0710 Dennis. Other pilot programs were conducted by ~A + ~S, Babylon,
E31 0720 New York; J& L& Hudson, Detroit; Joseph Horne, Pittsburgh.
E31 0730    Other ~THC activities followed, conducted by shopping
E31 0740 centers, department stores, recreation equipment dealers, radio-~TV
E31 0750 stations, newspapers, and other organizations interested in the
E31 0760 need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting
E31 0770 firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations
E31 0780 related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources. ~SAAMI's
E31 0790 field men have served as consultants and/or have participated in
E31 0800 75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached over 40,000 enthusiastic
E31 0810 young Americans.   Through the efforts of ~SAAMI's
E31 0820 shooting development program these shooting activities, and many
E31 0830 others, including assists in the development of public and privately
E31 0840 financed shooting parks, trap and skeet leagues, rifle and pistol marksmanship
E31 0850 programs have been promoted, to mention only a few.   The
E31 0860 continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will
E31 0870 assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made
E31 0880 aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities
E31 0890 for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand. While individual
E31 0900 sportsmen are aware of this situation, too many of our political,
E31 0910 social, educational and even religious leaders too often forget it. Help
E31 0920 is needed from dealers, at the grass-roots level.   The American
E31 0930 gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program
E31 0940 through their industry trade association. Since ~SAAMI's
E31 0950 conception in 1926, and more specifically since the adoption of the
E31 0960 Shooting Development Program in 1954, millions of dollars and promotional
E31 0970 man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot
E31 0980 for more youths and adults. We trust that you, as a gun and ammunition
E31 0990 dealer, have benefited through additional sales of equipment.
E31 1000    Are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports? Are you looking
E31 1010 ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and
E31 1020 girls, who will grow up to enjoy a traditional American way of life-
E31 1030 ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent
E31 1035 ammunition?   <Is your
E31 1040 sporting firearms and ammunition department
E31 1050 primed for the expanding horizons?>   Would you like to
E31 1060 organize Teen Hunters Clubs, shooting programs, and have information
E31 1070 on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags
E31 1080 on shooting preserves? Ask Sammy Shooter.
E31 1090 WE WERE CAMPING a few weeks ago on Cape Hatteras Campground in
E31 1100 that land of pirates, seagulls and bluefish on North Carolina's
E31 1110 famed Outer Banks. This beach campground with no trees or hills presents
E31 1120 a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual
E31 1130 use.   With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety
E31 1140 of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now. There were
E31 1150 umbrella tents, wall tents, cottage tents, station wagon tents, pup
E31 1160 tents, Pop tents, Baker tents, tents with exterior frames, camper trailers,
E31 1170 travel trailers, and even a few surplus parachutes serving as
E31 1180 sunshades over entire family camps.   Moving around camp we saw
E31 1190 all kinds of camp stoves, lanterns, coolers, bedding, games, fishing tackle,
E31 1200 windbreaks and sunshades. We saw similar displays in the other
E31 1210 three campgrounds in this 70 mile-long National Seashore Recreation
E31 1220 Area. Dealers would do well to visit such a campground often, look
E31 1230 at the equipment and talk with the campers. Here you begin to appreciate
E31 1240 the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry.
E31 1250    Camping is big and getting bigger. No one knows where it will
E31 1260 stop. Almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement
E31 1270 of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of
E31 1280 all outdoor markets. You read various guesses on how many Americans
E31 1290 are camping. The number depends on who is talking at the moment. The
E31 1300 figures range as high as 15 million families. I've heard 10 million
E31 1310 mentioned often, but I'm more inclined to think there may be a
E31 1320 total of some five to seven million families camping. Seven million families
E31 1340 would total 30 million Americans or more. Consider the equipment
E31 1350 needed to protect this many from the weather, to make their cooking
E31 1360 easy and their sleeping comfortable. #MORE CAMPERS THAN CAMPSITES#
E31 1370 Harassed state park officials often have more campers than they
E31 1380 know what to do with. They are struggling to meet the demand for camping
E31 1390 space, but families are being turned away, especially on holiday
E31 1400 weekends. The National Parks, always popular camping places, are facing
E31 1410 the same pressure. The National Park Service hopes by 1966 to
E31 1420 have 30,000 campsites available for 100,000 campers a day- almost
E31 1430 twice what there are at present. The U& S& Forest Service cares
E31 1440 for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 National Forests
E31 1450 and is increasing its facilities steadily.   But the campers still
E31 1460 come. They bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding.
E31 1470 They bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits.
E31 1480 They come prepared for family fun because Americans in ever-growing
E31 1490 numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation
E31 1500 that becomes a family experience of lasting importance. #WHY THEY
E31 1510 KEEP COMING# There are a half dozen reasons helping to account for
E31 1520 the migration to the campgrounds. Among them, according to the U&
E31 1530 S& Department of Commerce, are: (1) shorter work weeks, (2)
E31 1540 higher pay, (3) longer paid vacations, (4) better transportation, (5)
E31 1550 earlier retirement, and (6) more education. The more people learn about
E31 1560 their country, the more they want to learn. Camping is family fun,
E31 1570 and it is helping more Americans see more of the country than they ever
E31 1580 saw before.   But make no mistake about it, the first reason
E31 1590 people turn to camping is one of economy. Here is the promise of a vacation
E31 1600 trip they can afford.   The American Automobile Association,
E31 1610 computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile, comes
E31 1620 up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29. The ~AAA
E31 1630 then splits it down this way: $10.50 for meals, $9.50 for lodging,
E31 1640 $7 for gas and oil, and $2 for tips and miscellaneous.   What does
E31 1650 the camping couple do to this set of figures? The $9.50 for lodging
E31 1660 they save. Because they prepare their own meals they also keep in
E31 1670 their pockets a good portion of that $10.50 food bill along with most
E31 1680 of the tip money. The automobile expenses are about the only vacationing
E31 1690 cost they can't either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping
E31 1700 along the way.   Where Americans used to think of a single
E31 1710 vacation each summer, they now think about how many vacations they
E31 1720 can have. Long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or
E31 1730 four days several times a year. And even if they stay in resorts part
E31 1740 of the time, they might, if the right salesman gets them in tow, develop
E31 1750 a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip
E31 1760 into the wide open spaces.   It would be a mistake to sell those
E31 1770 thousands of beginning campers on the idea they're buying the comforts
E31 1780 of home. They're not. Home is the place to find the comforts of
E31 1790 home. They're buying fun and adventure and family experiences. But
E31 1800 it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable
E31 1810 camping has become. This is no longer a way of life for the bearded
E31 1820 logger and the wandering cowboy. Today's campers want comforts, and
E31 1830 they have them. And this helps explain why so many people are now going
E31 1840 camping. It's fun, and it's easy- so easy that there is time
E31 1850 left after cooking, and tent keeping, for the women to get out and
E31 1860 enjoy outdoor fun with their families.   Camp meals are no great
E31 1870 problem. Neither are beds, thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags.
E31 1880 Neither are shelters, because there is one to meet the needs of every
E31 1890 camper or prospective camper.   But there is still the sometimes
E31 1900 complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for
E31 1910 their individual needs.
E32 0010 @ Throughout history, the man who showed superior performance has become
E32 0020 the commander of others- for good or bad. Since the Industrial
E32 0030 Revolution, when factories emerged, this classical pattern has been
E32 0040 followed. {Until recently.}   There have always been tales
E32 0050 of disillusionment- the competent technician who became an administrator,
E32 0060 willingly or not, and found he didn't like it; the scientist
E32 0070 who rebelled against the personnel and paper work; and much more
E32 0080 commonly in recent years, the engineer who found that other duties interfered
E32 0090 with- or eliminated- his engineering contributions. {There
E32 0100 have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into
E32 0110 very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work, to their own and
E32 0120 the public's dissatisfaction and loss.}   This has been more
E32 0130 evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased
E32 0140 technology. The remedies have been many and varied- attempts to
E32 0150 teach management techniques- either in plant, at special schools,
E32 0160 or
E32 0170 in university "crash" courses- provision of management-trained assistants
E32 0180 or associates. {But the realization has been growing that
E32 0190 these are not the complete answer.} Some men have no talent for or
E32 0200 interest in management; forcing them into management can only create
E32 0210 trouble. The old shop adage still holds: "A good mechanic is usually
E32 0220 a bad boss".   Yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition
E32 0230 of managerial status as the gage of success. Labor fights to
E32 0240 change its collar from blue to white. All grades of management seek
E32 0250 more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures. As several
E32 0260 recent books have over-emphasized, {we have become the most status-conscious
E32 0270 nation in the world.}   {What can be done for
E32 0280 the "individual contributor"} who is extremely important- and
E32 0290 likely to be more so- in the operation of the technically oriented
E32 0300 company? He is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and
E32 0310 outside; usually concerned about America's belief that attainment
E32 0320 and success are measured in dollars and titles. Yet titles are traditionally
E32 0330 given only to management men, and income tends to rise with
E32 0340 title.   Even the college professor in America has been affected.
E32 0350 It is, as one engineer says, "indeed a difficult thing for the
E32 0360 engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he
E32 0370 could employing managerial skills. This difficulty arises even though
E32 0380 we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course. This
E32 0390 leads one to conclude, as you have, that there is inevitably more
E32 0400 prestige in a management position in the minds of our people".
E32 0410    Nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than
E32 0420 engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers. So we asked such
E32 0430 men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on
E32 0440 the "dual-road-up" problem- and more importantly- their solutions.
E32 0450 In the paragraphs that follow, we quote from 32 men who are identified
E32 0460 on the final page. #FIRST: WHAT TITLE, WHAT SETUP?# Among
E32 0470 the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of
E32 0480 General Electric. {This is not a mutually exclusive plan; there
E32 0490 is no one point in a man's career at which he must select either the
E32 0500 technical or the managerial path upward. Further, the management path
E32 0510 does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by
E32 0520 the more technical path. It is common to shift back and forth, working
E32 0530 up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions.}
E32 0540    Actually, there are a number of individual-contributor
E32 0550 positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide "services"
E32 0560 operation that are filled by men with successful managerial
E32 0570 experience who are currently broadening their capabilities.   Also,
E32 0580 moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man's
E32 0590 recognition as a technical expert. As examples at ~GE: Glen
E32 0600 B& Warren, formerly manager of the Turbine Division, widely recognized
E32 0610 as a turbine designer. The late W& R& G& Baker, a pioneer
E32 0620 in television design and long-time ~vp + ~gm of the Electronics
E32 0630 Division, and later, by his own choice, an individual consultant.
E32 0640 Harold E& Strang, expert in switchgear design, for a long period
E32 0650 ~vp + ~gm of the Measurements + Industrial Products Division,
E32 0660 and who currently, approaching retirement, is vice-president and consulting
E32 0670 engineer in the Switchgear + Control Division.   In
E32 0680 the ~GE plan, a number of individual contributors have positions
E32 0690 and compensation higher than those of many managers. These positions
E32 0700 carry such titles as:   Consultant- Advanced Development
E32 0710    Consulting Engineer   Consulting Engineer- Heat Transfer
E32 0720    Consulting Electrical Engineer   Senior Electrical
E32 0730 Engineer   Senior Physicist   Westinghouse has a similar
E32 0740 system, with two classifications representing various levels of competence
E32 0750 on the strictly technical side: consulting engineer or scientist,
E32 0760 as the case may be, and advisory engineer or scientist. Many
E32 0770 companies have systems, particularly in ~R + ~D, which work more
E32 0780 or less well, depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on
E32 0790 the part of administration, as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent
E32 0800 quotations.   Another factor that may hold hope is for parallel
E32 0810 recognition is, as one man says it: "**h that the fad for educating
E32 0820 top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically
E32 0830 trained approach". _SENIOR STAFF ENGINEER?_ One company instituted,
E32 0840 early in 1959, a vertical classification system consisting of four
E32 0850 levels. There is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks;
E32 0860 the top non-supervisory level, senior staff engineer, enjoys status
E32 0870 and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision.
E32 0880 The second level, senior engineer, rates slightly below first-level
E32 0890 supervision. The expectation is that first-level supervisors will
E32 0900 be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third
E32 0910 engineering level, with very few coming from the first level.
E32 0920    The company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for
E32 0930 non-supervisory engineers, but probably not into executive levels.
E32 0940 {In this organization, about half of the engineers with 15 or more
E32 0950 years of employment are in supervision, engineering or elsewhere.} This
E32 0960 reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products- which
E32 0970 are not military. Several other examples: _CENTRAL AND SATELLITE_
E32 0980 "We have over 20 divisions- each of which has an engineering
E32 0990 department headed by a chief engineer. We have set up a central ~R
E32 1000 + ~D department, as well as engineering-management departments-
E32 1010 about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants.
E32 1020 A separate research department is, of course, confined to new or future
E32 1030 designs. Part of this headquarters staff, however, are engineering
E32 1040 managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters
E32 1050 management. These headquarters engineers, headed by the vice-president-
E32 1060 Engineering, counsel and advise divisional managers and chief
E32 1070 engineers on product problems as well as aid with design; and many are
E32 1080 engineers who have been advanced from the divisions. These men are
E32 1090 considered managers of engineers. They must learn to wear several hats,
E32 1100 so to speak, working with management, sales and engineering problems
E32 1110 related to the product.   "We do not have people in our organization
E32 1120 termed 'consultants' or 'fellows', who are specialists
E32 1130 in one particular technical subject. I suppose it is because we are
E32 1140 just not big enough. We have a few 'consultants'- retired engineers
E32 1150 retained and called in on certain problems. The only 'fellows'
E32 1160 in our company are those who have been honored by ~ASME, ~AIEE
E32 1170 or ~AIChE **h I am sure that the engineer who enters
E32 1180 management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities
E32 1190 than he would have as a technical specialist- because of his wider
E32 1195 accountability".
E32 1200 _ANOTHER STRUCTURE_ "We have tried to make both
E32 1210 paths attractive, so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction
E32 1220 in either. One way to formalize this is in the job structure.
E32 1230 We have these positions, which compare directly: **f   "Above
E32 1240 these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president
E32 1250 of ~Engrg, ~R + ~D. The latter jobs include major management
E32 1260 responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily
E32 1270 through the engineering-management side **h {We have not yet
E32 1280 succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable
E32 1290 to our higher levels of management, but I believe we will trend
E32 1300 in this direction} **h but not to exceed vice-president". _TOP
E32 1310 JOB: RESEARCH SCIENTIST_ "Approximately four years ago, we
E32 1320 initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons **h The
E32 1330 highest position is known as a 'research scientist'. This approach
E32 1340 has not been entirely satisfactory. The primary deterrent appears to
E32 1350 lie with the technical people themselves, and their concept of what
E32 1360 constitutes status in present-day society. {Scientists who agitate
E32 1370 hardest
E32 1380 for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept
E32 1390 it **h We have discovered that the outward trappings such as private
E32 1400 offices and private secretaries are extremely important;} and although
E32 1410 we have attempted to provide these status symbols, support of the
E32 1420 'dual-ladder' plan has been half-hearted **h despite the creation
E32 1430 of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that
E32 1440 of men in top managerial positions.   {"A serious problem
E32 1450 accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly
E32 1460 defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level.}
E32 1470 With no set standards, there is the tendency to promote to the
E32 1480 next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless
E32 1490 of performance **h {promotion is too often based on longevity and
E32 1500 time in salary grade instead of merit.} If no specific organization
E32 1510 plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level,
E32 1520 the result is a department top-heavy with high-level, high-salaried personnel".
E32 1530 _STAFF ENGINEER @ DEPT MANAGER_ "We have two approaches
E32 1540 for the technical man: the position of staff engineer, which
E32 1550 is rated as high in salary as department manager; and an administrative
E32 1560 organization to take the routine load away from department managers
E32 1570 and project engineers as much as possible, thus allowing them more time
E32 1580 for strictly technical work. These are only halfway measures, and
E32 1590 the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man
E32 1600 in industry **h to progress without limit in salary and prestige".
E32 1610 _A COMPLETE PLAN_ "We have made limited application of the 'parallel
E32 1620 ladder' plan. The highest rated non-supervisory engineering
E32 1630 title is 'research engineer'. The salary schedule permits remuneration
E32 1640 greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering
E32 1650 supervision (engineering section head). We also have an 'engineering
E32 1660 section head- research engineer' classification which has salary
E32 1670 possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer. Above this
E32 1680 point there is no generally used parallel ladder.   "We also
E32 1690 do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a
E32 1695 'professional'
E32 1700 and also to give public recognition to individual technical
E32 1710 competence. {These include encouragement of, and assistance
E32 1720 to, the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers.
E32 1730 We have two media for publicizing individual technical activity, a magazine
E32 1740 widely distributed both within and without the company, and an
E32 1750 information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes
E32 1760 of all engineers.} Publicity is given to the award of patents to
E32 1770 our egnineers and financial support is provided for individual membership
E32 1780 in technical societies.   "A recent, and more pertinent action,
E32 1790 has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the
E32 1800 vice-president for Engineering. This function is staffed by engineers
E32 1810 chosen for their technical competence and who have the title, member
E32 1820 of the technical staff'. Salaries compare favorably with those paid
E32 1830 to the first two or three levels of management. Additional symbols
E32 1840 of status are granted, such as reserved parking, distinctive badge passes
E32 1850 authorizing special privileges, and a difference in the treatment
E32 1860 of financial progress through merit.   "We presently are involved
E32 1870 in inaugurating a new development center. Operations of this nature
E32 1880 offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status. All scientific
E32 1890 staff members will have the title, 'research-staff member'.
E32 1900 The salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the
E32 1910 scientific community's acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific
E32 1920 field. Contrary to usual organization-position evaluations,
E32 1930 the position to which research-staff members report administratively will
E32 1940 not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member,
E32 1950 therefore, are not necessarily evaluated as highly.   "These
E32 1960 recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number
E32 1970 of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence. It
E32 1980 is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result
E32 1990 entirely from company efforts. Fundamental to the difficulty of creating
E32 2000 the desired prestige is the fact that, in the business community,
E32 2010 prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that
E32 2020 one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in
E32 2030 the management functions".
E33 0010    SIXTY MILES NORTH of New York City where the wooded hills
E33 0020 of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the Hudson River there
E33 0030 is a new home development called "Oakwood Heights". As a matter
E33 0040 of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated
E33 0050 county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages
E33 0060 in the $14,000 range. But Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular
E33 0070 **h its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line
E33 0080 that starts at a central storage point.   This is a pilot operation
E33 0090 sponsored by a new entity chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State
E33 0100 Pipeline Corporation, with principal offices in New York State.
E33 0110 Its president is Otis M& Waters, partner in the law firm of Timen
E33 0120 + Waters, 5404 Chrysler Bldg&, New York City. Vice-president
E33 0130 is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark Ritter.
E33 0140 Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and president of Kahler-Craft
E33 0150 Distributors, Inc&, Newburgh, N&Y&.   The idea
E33 0160 of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty.
E33 0170 Not a year goes by but what several local companies in the U& S&
E33 0180 and Canada, even overseas, write to FUELOIL + OIL HEAT to inquire
E33 0190 if it's feasible and where it is being done. Its editors only
E33 0200 knew of one example to point to, a public housing development of 278
E33 0210 homes in New Haven described by John Schulz in the March, 1950 issue.
E33 0220 This has survived the years but there has been considerable concern
E33 0230 among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered. Rather
E33 0240 the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis
E33 0250 of number of rooms and persons in the family.   Common complaints
E33 0260 included "Mrs& Murphy" leaving her windows open all the time,
E33 0270 a fresh air fan, or the family was visiting "Aunt Minnie" with
E33 0280 the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil. As a
E33 0290 result of that attitude, others have been discouraged from trying central
E33 0300 distribution.   A new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks
E33 0310 the situation at Oakwood Heights. Called a "Slo-Flo" meter
E33 0320 it was designed for this job by Power Plus Industries of Los Angeles,
E33 0330 a key individual being Don Nelson. Tri-State has acquired
E33 0340 its exclusive distribution for the northern, principal heating states.
E33 0350    There's an advantage in having a firm like Tri-State headed
E33 0360 by a lawyer. The earlier New Haven development was public housing,
E33 0370 so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture. These
E33 0380 have to do with property rights, municipal official attitudes and
E33 0390 a host of others. In working out the practical legal conclusions President
E33 0400 Waters was not thinking only of this pilot project, for it is
E33 0410 planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments
E33 0420 nationally.   It is always difficult, or at least time-consuming,
E33 0430 to get approval of any kind of line under a public street, as one
E33 0440 example. To overcome this, the builder lays and completes the street
E33 0450 himself, then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual
E33 0460 easement for the oil lines. When a family buys a home the title is subject
E33 0470 to a perpetual easement to Tri-State. For the central storage,
E33 0480 Tri-State buys one acre, Buries its tanks and simply holds permanent
E33 0490 title to that piece. In other words, the whole storage and pipeline
E33 0500 system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather
E33 0510 to Tri-State.   How does Tri-State get its revenue from this
E33 0520 plan? It leases the whole facility to a large oil company, at least
E33 0530 large enough to have a strong credit position. This first test is
E33 0540 being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least
E33 0550 15 years. The amount paid by the oil company to Tri-State for the use
E33 0560 of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all
E33 0570 the homes, is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable
E33 0580 to both parties.   On this first venture the central storage is
E33 0590 20,000 gallons, in two tanks, or an average of 400 gallons for each of
E33 0600 the 50 homes. The supplier delivers at his convenience in transport
E33 0610 loads, so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather
E33 0620 contingencies. However, that is not all he has to do. He must
E33 0630 undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine
E33 0640 heating. In the present project the heating is by circulating hot water
E33 0650 form Paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot
E33 0660 water hookups. Again, the oil man must read the meters at such intervals
E33 0670 as he finds best.   For this first development the supplier
E33 0680 signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being
E33 0690 transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor. The major
E33 0700 gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor
E33 0710 apparently can do well because delivery cost is low. #INITIAL
E33 0720 CONSIDERATIONS# The officers of the new corporation have naturally
E33 0730 explored many angles, as well as personalities that might be affected.
E33 0740 For example, the officials of Poughkeepsie town (township) where the
E33 0750 project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow
E33 0760 clearing problem. The central storage is near a main artery quite
E33 0770 easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing, with fewer
E33 0780 trucks in the residential streets.   The Public Service Commission
E33 0790 has ruled that this is not a public utility, subject to
E33 0800 their
E33 0810 many regulations.   Several financial institutions, both banks
E33 0820 and insurance companies, have been sounded out. They like it and would
E33 0830 supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong
E33 0840 oil companies.   The Government housing agencies consider it
E33 0850 feasible with one special stipulation. There must be a restriction in
E33 0860 the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the
E33 0870 current market price for the oil **h an obvious precaution, since the
E33 0880 account is permanently wedded, just like with gas or electricity.
E33 0890    For a few details of the system **h the lines are 1-1/4''
E33 0900 <X-Tru-Coat,> a product of Republic Steel Corp&, and all lines
E33 0910 are welded. They are laid a minimum of 24'' deep and in some
E33 0920 areas four feet down, particularly under roads, to stay clear of all
E33 0930 other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy
E33 0940 trucking. The meter is mounted high on the basement wall. Its figures
E33 0950 are a half inch high and very easy to read, even into tenth gallons.
E33 0960 It will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour.
E33 0970    Ritter, the builder, is convinced that the total cost of all the
E33 0980 heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than
E33 0990 would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters.
E33 1000 He believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder
E33 1010 developments where gas is available.   It would be pretty
E33 1020 difficult to install a Tri-State system in old neighborhoods, and that's
E33 1030 an understatement. The job of getting property easements and street
E33 1040 easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging.
E33 1050 But in a new development where everything starts from scratch
E33 1060 the solutions are simple. #FUTURE PLANS# What does Tri-State actually
E33 1070 want to do, now that it has the meters under franchise and certain
E33 1080 phases of its piping system in the "patent applied for" stage?
E33 1090 It wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including
E33 1100 its facility in their new home projects, by financing and installing
E33 1110 the storage, piping and meters, and leasing these for 15 years,
E33 1120 with renewal options, to a strong oil company. It may also work in one
E33 1130 other way- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters,
E33 1140 letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities.
E33 1150    This whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers,
E33 1160 for the idea has so often been mentioned, somewhat wistfully.
E33 1170 But it's too early yet to go visit Oakwood Heights. Only eight of
E33 1180 the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor's visit on
E33 1190 June 8th; others were building. The big tanks were at the site but
E33 1200 still sunning themselves. A big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches,
E33 1210 and the town building inspector was paying a friendly, if curious,
E33 1220 visit.   The oilheating industry is looking up, led by a revival
E33 1230 of research and development. A primary ingredient in these fields
E33 1240 is imagination, and Tri-State Pipeline Corporation deserves a
E33 1250 very good mark.
E33 1260    EVERY YEAR about this time National Gargle Your Cooling
E33 1270 System week rolls around. It pays in the long (hot) run to take good
E33 1280 care of the water works. Do it this way for the summer gargle:
E33 1290    @ First, drain that old coolant down the storm sewer. Don't
E33 1300 save the anti-freeze, even if it the expensive "permanent" type.
E33 1310 The word means it won't boil away easily, nothing else. The rust
E33 1320 inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year, and you don't want
E33 1330 to risk the rust that two years' use could mean. Pitch it out.
E33 1340    @ If a lot of rust shows in the drain, use a good flushing cleaner.
E33 1350    @ Then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor. Of
E33 1360 course, you'll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators.
E33 1370    @ Now, check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections,
E33 1380 around the freeze-out plugs, gaskets, water pump seals and heater
E33 1390 fittings.   @ Next, run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat
E33 1400 opens, and then look for leaks again. Be sure the bugs and
E33 1410 dirt are blown out of the radiator fins. Use the air hose for this job.
E33 1420 Check the temperature gage and be sure it is working.   If you
E33 1430 use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as "Dowguard"
E33 1440 be sure to check it. Dow says that the fluid can be used now
E33 1450 for two years. Check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in
E33 1460 during the summer.   Take precautions now, to be sure you avoid
E33 1470 those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms
E33 1480 this summer.   {Don't let your mechanics} pull the thermostats
E33 1490 out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours.
E33 1500 Spring and summer may be here officially, but those thermos stay
E33 1510 in.   The fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from
E33 1520 any water cooled vehicle, will greatly increase the fuel consumption,
E33 1530 reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation
E33 1540 of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators.   If you
E33 1550 run into excess plug fouling on one truck, check to be sure that the rig
E33 1560 has a thermostat. The thermostat is important to get your engine up
E33 1570 to operating temperature quickly, and to keep it running at its most
E33 1580 efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant.
E33 1590    {Are you paying too much} for your truck insurance? There's
E33 1600 a good chance you are doubling on some coverage, not taking discounts
E33 1610 coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut.
E33 1620    Have a talk with your insurance agent. Be careful that you keep
E33 1630 adequate coverage, but look for places to save money. First go over the
E33 1640 type of coverage you now have. Look for these features which may mean
E33 1650 you can save:   @ Duplicate coverage. Avoid doubling up
E33 1660 on the same item. For example, don't pay in a truck policy for medical
E33 1670 coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy.
E33 1680    @ Does your policy have a lay-up clause? This means that
E33 1690 if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days, insurance
E33 1700 can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to
E33 1710 you. This applies to repair work or winter storage.   The figure
E33 1720 five is important in insurance. With many company policies you get
E33 1730 a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs. This means either cars
E33 1740 or trucks. Discounts run up to 2% of cost.   Usually premium
E33 1750 reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability
E33 1760 plan. For example: If your bodily injury claims start payment after
E33 1770 the first $250, a 25% premium saving is often made.
E34 0010 {I}n the period since the end of World War /2,- a period
E34 0015 coinciding
E34 0020 with merchandising demands for the colorful, the unusual, and the original
E34 0030 in signs and displays- plastics have come on so strong that
E34 0040 today
E34 0050 they are the acknowledged leaders in the field. The importance of the
E34 0060 sign industry to the plastics industry, however, is not in terms of
E34 0070 volume alone. Designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing
E34 0080 approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings
E34 0090 of other industries. Many of today's developments in thermoforming
E34 0100 stem from original work done with signs and displays; the art of
E34 0110 preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers;
E34 0130 and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons,
E34 0140 medallions, etc&, owes much to the field, as does the technology
E34 0150 of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent
E34 0160 plastics.   There is much that many industries can continue to
E34 0170 learn from some of the more recent developments described below. The
E34 0180 concept of trans-illumination (as shown by the photo on p& 92), as just
E34 0190 one example, offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems-
E34 0200 no matter what industry is involved. #A VOLUME MARKET# According
E34 0210 to a recent <Wall Street Journal> survey, plastics units now
E34 0220 account for more than 50% of all sign sales. Five years ago, they had
E34 0230 only 10% of the market, with the remainder firmly entrenched in the
E34 0240 stronghold of neon tubing. And it's far from the end for plastics.
E34 0250 Industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during
E34 0260 the 1960's will be of plastic construction. Evidence of this
E34 0270 trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies
E34 0280 in the field as Advance Neon Sign Co&, Los Angeles, Calif&.
E34 0290 Four years ago, the company's entire line was devoted to neon
E34 0300 signs; today, 85% is in plastics.   From the volume standpoint,
E34 0310 the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive. Aggregate
E34 0320 sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million. Currently,
E34 0330 there are some 6000 companies in the field, ranging from small firms
E34 0340 with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities
E34 0350 for production of metal, electrical, and plastic components. #WHY
E34 0360 THE TREND TO PLASTICS?# What accounts for the rapid growth
E34 0370 of plastics in the sign and display field? Out of many factors which
E34 0380 might be cited, five are most important: _1._ Plastics combine
E34 0390 such properties as built-in color, light weight, optional transparency
E34 0400 or translucency, resistance to corrosion, as well as the ease of fabrication.
E34 0410 _2._ Plastic signs are economical. According to one
E34 0420 major producer, materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately
E34 0430 25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit. Shipping cost is
E34 0440 also reduced; a 3-by- 6-ft& plastic sign weighs about 120 lb&,
E34 0450 compared to 275-300 lb& for neon. The weight advantage, plus greater
E34 0460 durability of the plastic unit, yields a saving of about one-fifth
E34 0470 in shipping. The lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings
E34 0480 are needed. Finally, maintenance costs on plastic signs are
E34 0490 much lower than on fragile neon signs. _3._ They offer exceptional
E34 0495 design freedom, making it
E34 0500 possible to incorporate contours and details
E34 0510 which give free range to the talents of the designer. Vacuum- and pressure-formed
E34 0520 sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded
E34 0525 plastics. Pre-decoration,
E34 0530 low-cost molds, and the freedom to form large
E34 0540 and small, thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the
E34 0550 industry. _4._ Plastics signs work around the clock. Internal
E34 0560 illumination, protected from the elements, gives them powerful visual
E34 0570 appeal at night; during daylight hours their brilliant colors command
E34 0580 attention and interest. _5._ Advances in equipment and fabrication
E34 0590 techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide
E34 0600 choice of production techniques, ranging from injection molding for
E34 0610 intricate, smaller-size, mass-production signs (generally 5000 units is
E34 0620 the minimum) to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited
E34 0630 runs. Among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field
E34 0640 are expandable styrene molding and blow molding. _WHAT PLASTICS
E34 0650 TO USE?_ For outdoor signs and displays, acrylic, with its outstanding
E34 0660 optical characteristics, weather resistance and formability, strongly
E34 0670 dominates the picture. At present, both the familiar cast acrylic
E34 0680 and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers,
E34 0690 with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total. (See
E34 0700 panel, p& 166, for a comparison.)   Of interest is a recent
E34 0705 announcement by Du Pont's
E34 0710 Polychemicals Dept& of a new methyl methacrylate
E34 0720 monomer designated as Monocite ~H 100, which was developed
E34 0730 specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and
E34 0740 lighting industry. Sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs
E34 0750 only one-third as much as glass, is impervious to all kinds of weather,
E34 0760 and will not yellow. Its high impact strength, even at low temperatures,
E34 0770 resists chipping, cracking, and crazing, according to Du Pont.
E34 0780    Cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed
E34 0790 signs, background panels, and molded or formed letters because of its
E34 0800 exceptional toughness, ease of forming, and excellent weathering properties.
E34 0810 Its clarity and good optical properties are other important
E34 0820 factors. New to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which
E34 0830 the two sheets of the laminate are of different color. Thermoforming
E34 0840 the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical
E34 0850 way to produce a two-color sign. (see ~MPl, Mar& 1961,
E34 0860 p&
E34 0870 98).   For specialized types of displays, such as large three-dimensional
E34 0880 units reproducing a product, package, human or animal figures,
E34 0890 etc&, reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols
E34 0900 are other materials frequently used.   A relative newcomer
E34 0905 in
E34 0910 outdoor signs is Mylar polyester film, now used as a printed overlay
E34 0920 for trans-illuminated signs (see below).   For outdoor signs and
E34 0930 displays, where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a
E34 0940 factor, the choice of plastics is almost unlimited. Here may be found
E34 0950 regular and impact styrene, cellulose acetate, cellulose butyrate and
E34 0960 cellulose propionate, acrylic, vinyl, expandable styrene foam, and polyethylene.
E34 0970 The final choice of material depends upon such factors as
E34 0980 costs, method of fabrication, degree of complexity, number of units
E34 0990 required, time available for tooling, and projected life expectancy of
E34 1000 the unit. Often, the finished sign or display incorporates several types
E34 1010 of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques. #TRANS-ILLUMINATED
E34 1020 BILLBOARDS# One of the most significant advancements in design
E34 1030 of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard, now
E34 1040 being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as Advance
E34 1050 Neon Sign Co&, Los Angeles, and Industrial Electric Inc&,
E34 1060 New Orleans, La&.   The essential difference between the new
E34 1070 trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former,
E34 1080 constructed of translucent plastic panels, are lighted from within.
E34 1090 With the source of light behind the copy, there is no loss of lumen output,
E34 1100 as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light.
E34 1110 Also, the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure
E34 1120 and cannot obstruct the view of the sign.   The copy itself,
E34 1130 including any text or illustrations, is reproduced in full color directly
E34 1140 on a thin Mylar polyester film by a photo screen process. The
E34 1150 film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto
E34 1160 the acrylic panels forming the sign, and also to be stripped off for
E34 1170 replacement by new copy as required. Spare sets of face panels simplify
E34 1180 the change from one copy or message to another; new panels are exchanged
E34 1190 for the old right in the field on a single trip. Panels with
E34 1200 outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied.
E34 1210    Signs of this type have already made their appearance
E34 1220 in several larger cities, and others are on the way. It is believed that
E34 1230 these boards will, within the next few years, replace many of the
E34 1240 conventional flood-lighted boards now in use.   Trans-illuminated
E34 1250 signs also show versatility in other directions. As used by Industrial
E34 1260 Electric Inc&, the film panels are printed one at a time, as
E34 1270 are 24-sheet posters. Thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent
E34 1280 plastics faces; they can also be applied to opaque panels
E34 1290 for use on cutouts, or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin
E34 1300 faces. In this way, the sign maker has an economical means for displaying
E34 1310 uniform copy on different sign media.   Recently Industrial
E34 1320 Electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern
E34 1330 plastic materials- a revolving spectacular sign. Comprised of 16
E34 1340 triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections, it makes it possible to
E34 1350 combine three different signs in a single unit. The triangles automatically
E34 1360 revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec& of viewing time for
E34 1370 each poster subject. Sixteen panels, each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft&
E34 1380 wide, make up the 25-ft& length of the sign. #CHANGEABLE LETTERS
E34 1390 FILL MANY NEEDS# Perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility
E34 1400 of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays
E34 1410 would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this
E34 1420 complex field- changeable signs.   Signs are meant to convey
E34 1430 a message, and in most cases, this requires words and letters. Frequently,
E34 1440 the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products,
E34 1450 price changes, etc&. The huge market for changeable signs has spurred
E34 1460 a universal demand for individual plastic letters, in all shapes
E34 1470 and sizes- and a number of companies are set up to supply them. Here
E34 1480 are some of the newer items currently available:   Poster Products
E34 1490 Inc&, Chicago, Ill&: a changeable copy and display
E34 1495 sign
E34 1500 which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of
E34 1510 colors, onto which are mounted snap-in letters, figures, or words screened
E34 1520 on acetate or other types of sheet stock. The background, which
E34 1525 is available
E34 1530 in various widths and continuous lengths, is extruded with
E34 1540 parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely.
E34 1550    The Adaptaplex Co&, Beaverton, Ore&; letters molded
E34 1560 of butyrate, available in several sizes in either red or black. Ideal
E34 1570 for merchandising use, they are weather-resistant, and have mounting
E34 1580 pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern
E34 1590 background panel.   For large letters, <e&g&> thermoformed
E34 1600 of acrylic or butyrate, there are other techniques. For example,
E34 1610 in a typical store installation, fifty 24-in& and six 36-in& red
E34 1620 acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background.
E34 1630 The fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb& each made
E34 1640 it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic
E34 1650 angle brackets cemented to the letters. Stainless steel screws were
E34 1660 used to minimize corrosion stains. For mounting to corrugated plastic
E34 1670 backgrounds, very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters
E34 1680 and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings, its ends
E34 1690 twisted behind the panels.   Large injection-molded letters are
E34 1700 also available for sign installations. Wagner Sign Service Inc&,
E34 1710 Chicago, for example, supplies them in several colors, in heights of
E34 1720 4, 6, 8, 10, and 17 inches. They are molded of a special weather-resistant
E34 1730 formulation of Tenite butyrate. Also available from this company
E34 1740 are Snug-Grip Plasti-Bars, extruded of transparent acrylic material,
E34 1750 which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material.
E34 1760 Made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft&, the bars are shaped in cross
E34 1770 section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back
E34 1780 of the letters.   Still another approach to the changeable letter
E34 1790 type of sign is a modular unit introduced by Merritt Products, Azusa,
E34 1800 Calif&. This vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in& (or
E34 1810 smaller) panels formed of 0.080-in& clear butyrate sheet stock, masked
E34 1820 and sprayed on the rear side. Finished signs are produced by sliding
E34 1830 the separate letter panels into channels of 0.025-in& aluminum,
E34 1840 which may be mounted to various surfaces. The sheets are extruded of
E34 1850 Tenite butyrate by Jet Specialties Co&, Los Angeles, Calif&.
E34 1860    On large-area units, where additional structural requirements
E34 1870 are imposed, one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed
E34 1880 channels (<e&g&> right-angled corrugations) of the acrylic or butyrate.
E34 1890 Joined side by side, such channels make possible construction
E34 1900 of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft& high and
E34 1910 of unlimited width. Letters may be wired to the face of the combined
E34 1920 channels, painted on the first surface, or handled in other ways.
E35 0010 #NEW RULE NO& 2: DON'T BUILD FROM THE OUTSIDE IN- TRY TO BUILD
E35 0020 FROM
E35 0030 THE INSIDE OUT# Don't insert your components into fixed openings,
E35 0040 they may or may not fit; position your components before you close
E35 0050 them in. For example:   Don't wall in your kitchen before
E35 0060 you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances. It's a lot quicker
E35 0070 and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect
E35 0080 the end wall after they are all in place.   Set your bathtub before
E35 0090 you close in the end of the bathroom. Don't try to wrestle a
E35 0100 400-~lb tub **f through a narrow doorway.   Finish your plumbing
E35 0110 before you frame it in (most economical framing is a thin non-bearing
E35 0120 partition on either side of the pipes).   Finish installing and
E35 0130 connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them
E35 0140 in. There is no better way to waste time than trying to install a
E35 0150 furnace in a finished **f closet.   Don't position your studs
E35 0160 before you insert your windows in conventional construction; that way
E35 0170 you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the
E35 0180 window. You can save all that shimming time if you set your windows
E35 0190 in one, two, three order- first the stud on one side, then the window,
E35 0200 then the stud on the other side.   Install your disappearing
E35 0210 stair (or stairs) to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before
E35 0220 you drywall the ceiling.   Don't close in your house until everything
E35 0230 has been carried in. Last wall Bob Schmitt erects is the wall
E35 0240 between the house and garage. That way he can truck his parts right
E35 0250 indoors and unload them under the roof.   No auto maker would
E35 0260 dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons
E35 0270 in the block. And trailer makers, those most industrialized and therefore
E35 0280 most efficient of homebuilders, say they save hundreds of dollars
E35 0290 by always building from the inside out. #NEW RULE NO& 3 RETHINK
E35 0300 EVERYTHING
E35 0310 TO GET ALL THE BIG SAVINGS THE REVOLUTION IN MATERIALS HANDLING
E35 0320 OFFERS YOU# This revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less
E35 0330 news of all, because **h _1._ It makes it easy to handle much heavier
E35 0340 units, so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated
E35 0350 components like those shown in the pictures alongside. _2._
E35 0360 It makes materials handling the only construction cost that (like
E35 0370 earthmoving and roadbuilding) should be lower today than in 1929. _3._
E35 0380 It changes the answers to "Who should do what, and where"?
E35 0390 It lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases
E35 0400 the chance for shop fabrication, where almost everything can be made
E35 0410 better and cheaper. _4._ It changes the answers on when to do what
E35 0420 at the site. For example, instead of putting in your driveways last
E35 0430 (as many builders do) you can now save money by putting them in first.
E35 0440 Instead of closing the house in first (as most builders do) you can
E35 0450 now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to (<see
E35 0455 ~p
E35 0460 121>). _5._ It changes the answers on builder-dealer relations.
E35 0470 Not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs
E35 0480 by "buying direct" and short-cutting the dealer. But now many of
E35 0490 these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming
E35 0500 up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient
E35 0501 specialized equipment
E35 0510 to deliver everything just where it is needed-
E35 0520 drywall inside the house, siding along the sides, trusses on the walls,
E35 0530 roofing on the roof, etc&.   Says Clarence Thompson: "We
E35 0540 dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder
E35 0550 cheaper than he could do it himself". The revolution now under
E35 0560 way in materials handling makes this much easier. _THE REVOLUTION
E35 0570 IS WELL UNDER WAY, BUT MUCH MORE REMAINS TO BE DONE_ Five years ago
E35 0580 a HOUSE + HOME Round Table cosponsored by the Lumber Dealers'
E35 0590 Research Council reported unhappily:   "Only one lumber
E35 0600 dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads; only one box car
E35 0610 in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads; only one producer
E35 0620 in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads; only one builder
E35 0630 in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads.   "So
E35 0640 from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling
E35 0650 (most of it inefficient) add up to one-fourth of the total construction
E35 0660 cost of housing".   "That HOUSE + HOME Round Table
E35 0670 was the real starting point for today's revolution in materials
E35 0680 handling", says Clarence Thompson, long chairman of the Lumber Dealers'
E35 0690 Research Council. "It made our whole industry recognize
E35 0700 the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer, carrier, equipment
E35 0710 maker, dealer, and builder, all working together to cut the cost
E35 0720 of materials handling. Before that we lumber dealers were working
E35 0730 almost single-handed on the problem". _HERE IS WHERE THINGS STAND
E35 0740 TODAY:_ _1._ Almost all of the 3,000 lumber dealers who cater
E35 0750 primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year's new
E35 0760 houses are mechanized. There are few areas left where a builder cannot
E35 0770 find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything
E35 0780 at lower cost just where his workmen will need it. _2._ Practically
E35 0790 all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized
E35 0800 or unitized for mechanical handling- including lumber, asphalt
E35 0810 shingles, glass block, face brick, plaster, lime, hardboard, gypsum
E35 0820 wallboard and sheathing, cement, insulation sheathing, floor tile, acoustical
E35 0830 tile, plaster base, and asbestos shingles. _3._ Truck and
E35 0840 materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to
E35 0850 meet almost every homebuilding need. For some significant new items
E35 0860 see the pictures. _4._ More than 50% of all lumber is unitized;
E35 0870 an ~NLRDA survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will
E35 0880 strap their shipments for mechanized handling. Of these, 376 said they
E35 0890 make no extra charge for strapping in standard units, because they
E35 0900 save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost.
E35 0901 Most of the others
E35 0910 will swallow their 50@ to $3 charge rather than lose
E35 0920 a good customer. "With a 15,500-~lb fork-lift, dealers can unload
E35 0930 unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for 30@/~mbf compared
E35 0940 with $1.65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time", says
E35 0950 James Wright of ~NLRDA. _5._ Lumber dealers and lumber
E35 0960 manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments-
E35 0970 48'' wide by a nominal 30'' high (or six McCracken packets
E35 0980 24'' wide by nominal 7'' high). These units make it easy to
E35 0990 load as much as 48,000 ~bd ~ft (say 120,000 ~lb in a 50' box
E35 1000 car- much more than the average for loose-loaded cars. _6._ The
E35 1010 railroads have responded by adding 20,000 more box cars with doors 12'
E35 1020 or wider for forklift unloading (a 21% increase while the total
E35 1030 number of box cars was falling 6%) and by cutting their freight rates
E35 1040 twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars. First was a 1958 cut
E35 1050 of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40,000
E35 1060 ~lb; later came a 1961 cut on the West Coast (still pending elsewhere)
E35 1070 of 7@/~cwt on 70,000 ~lb-plus carloads (which works out to
E35 1080 more than $4/~mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70,000
E35 1090 ~lb). _7._ More unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars,
E35 1100 and ~NLRDA studies show that flat cars loaded with the new Type
E35 1110 6-~B floating-load method can be unloaded for at little at 5.4@/~mbf.
E35 1120 For long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof
E35 1130 paper. This costs from 75@ to $2.30/~mbf, but the cover can
E35 1140 pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open. _THESE CARRIERS
E35 1150 CUT HANDLING COSTS FOR THE DEALER- AND THE BUILDER_ Says ~NRLDA's
E35 1160 James Wright: "Since 1958 carriers that move material
E35 1170 from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes
E35 1180 than any of the dealer's other equipment".   The reason: today's
E35 1190 components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled
E35 1200 by a truckdriver and a helper. So manufacturers have pioneered a new
E35 1210 type of vehicle- the self-unloading carrier. It cuts the lumber dealer's
E35 1220 cost because it takes only one man- the driver- to unload
E35 1230 it, and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction
E35 1240 of the cost of hand unloading. and it helps the builder because it
E35 1250 can handle a more efficiently packaged load, can deliver it to the best
E35 1260 spot (in some cases, right on the roof or inside the house), and never
E35 1270 takes any of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it.
E35 1280    Says Wright: "Our survey shows that one third of the
E35 1290 retail
E35 1300 dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling
E35 1310 in the coming two years. And most of the gain will be in self-unloading
E35 1320 vehicles". #NEW RULE NO& 4: RESTUDY WHAT YOUR MEN DO,
E35 1330 TO HELP THEM WASTE LESS OF THE TIME YOU PAY FOR# Half the manhours
E35 1340 you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right,
E35 1350 so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right
E35 1360 time, or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots
E35 1370 or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection, or you
E35 1380 bought cheap materials that took too long to fit, or your workmen had
E35 1390 to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip.
E35 1400    Even "America's most efficient builder", Bob Schmitt
E35 1410 of Berea, hopes to cut his labor costs another $2,000 per house as a
E35 1420 result of the time-+-motion studies now being completed on his operation
E35 1430 by industrial efficiency engineers from the Stanley Works. Already
E35 1440 this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from
E35 1450 170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion.   Builder
E35 1460 Eddie Carr of Washington, past president of ~NAHB, cut his bricklaying
E35 1470 costs $150 a house by adopting the "~SCR masonry process"
E35 1480 worked out after careful time-+-motion studies by the Structural
E35 1490 Clay Products Research Foundation to help bricklayers do better
E35 1500 work for less. A midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand
E35 1510 bricks from $81 to $43.50 by adopting this same process, cut them another
E35 1520 $7.50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient, easy-to-spot 100-brick
E35 1530 packages. The ~SCR process, with its precision corner-posts,
E35 1540 its precision guide lines, its working level scaffold, and its hand-level
E35 1550 brick supply takes eight manhours to get set, but once ready
E35 1560 it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day. See
E35 1570 <page 156>.   One good way to cut your labor waste is to make
E35 1580 sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew. Reports
E35 1590 Jim Lendrum: "By studying men on the job, we found that two men-
E35 1600 a carpenter and a helper- can lay a floor faster than three. We
E35 1610 found that three men- two carpenters and a helper- can put up wall
E35 1620 panels or trusses more economically than four men- because four men
E35 1630 don't make two teams; they make one inefficient three-men-and-a-helper
E35 1640 team. We found that wherever you can use two teams on a job,
E35 1650 five men, not four, is the magic number".   No house was ever
E35 1660 built that could not have been built better for less if the work had
E35 1670 been better planned and the work better scheduled. #NEW RULE NO&
E35 1680 5: DON'T WASTE ANY 10@-A-MINUTE TIME ON GREEN LUMBER TO SAVE 3@
E35 1690 A STUD# This is the most penny-wise, pound-foolish chisel a builder
E35 1700 can commit.   Green lumber was all very well back in the days
E35 1710 of wet plaster, when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then
E35 1720 shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum. But now that all production
E35 1730 builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels,
E35 1740 green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford.   Green
E35 1750 studs cost about 65@; dry studs cost less than 3@ more. So if
E35 1760 a green stud makes a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste
E35 1770 even 20 seconds, the green stud becomes more expensive than a dry
E35 1780 stud.
E36 0010    There comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to
E36 0020 be alone. Not necessarily to be off all by ourselves, but away from the
E36 0030 crowds and common happenstance. If you've travelled in Europe a
E36 0040 time or two, it is quite certain that you've had that wanting-to-be-alone
E36 0050 feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the Atlantic.
E36 0060 Following a guide, and gratefully so, is an excellent way to
E36 0070 see all the important places when everything is strange and new. However,
E36 0080 after you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas, the
E36 0090 places and forums, the churches and museums, the palaces and castles,
E36 0100 and begin to feel at home in the capitals of Europe, you'll want to
E36 0110 change your course and follow the by-roads at will, far from the market
E36 0120 places.   The champagne at Troyes, the traditional capital
E36 0130 of the champagne country, has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has
E36 0140 at a sidewalk cafe on the Rue de la Paix or at Tour d'Argent. You
E36 0150 can relive history and follow, in fancy, the Crusaders in their quest
E36 0160 for the Holy Grail as they sail out from Brindisi, an ancient
E36 0170 town in the heel of Italy's boot. And you don't meet the folks from
E36 0180 home in Northwest Spain which has remained almost untouched by time
E36 0190 and tourists since the Middle Ages. Time stands still as you climb
E36 0200 the narrow, stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain
E36 0210 slopes or wander through story-book towns, perched atop lofty crags,
E36 0220 their faces turned to the sea. They've been there since the days
E36 0230 of the Moors and the Saracens. And what better way to end a day
E36 0240 than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman's
E36 0250 village on the Mediterranean?   An almost too-simple-to-be-true
E36 0260 way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself
E36 0270 behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road.   For those
E36 0280 who need or want and can afford another car, buying one and driving
E36 0290 it on the grand tour, then shipping it home, is one popular plan for
E36 0300 a do-it-yourself pilgrimage. Then, of course, there are those of us
E36 0310 who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car. The answer
E36 0320 to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one.
E36 0330 It is that elemental.   Almost any travel agent will reserve
E36 0340 a car for you. You can call one of the car rental services directly
E36 0350 (Hertz, Avis, Auto-Europe Nationalcar Rental, and others) and ask
E36 0360 them to reserve a car of your choice, and some transportation lines
E36 0370 offer this service as well. With few exceptions, your car will be waiting
E36 0380 for you at dockside, airport, railroad station or hotel when you
E36 0390 arrive, oftentimes at no additional cost. You can wait, of course, until
E36 0400 you arrive in Europe before renting your car. The disadvantages
E36 0410 to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models
E36 0420 readily available or you may have to wait a few days or, during the busy
E36 0430 tourist season, when cars are in great demand, you might find it fairly
E36 0440 difficult to get a car at all. Since charges are relatively the
E36 0450 same, reserving a car before you leave for Europe will assure you of
E36 0460 having one on tap when you want it.   For those who plan to travel
E36 0470 to Europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer
E36 0480 a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave
E36 0490 it in another city, or even another country, when you are ready to
E36 0500 return home. At some cities, this pick-up and delivery service is without
E36 0510 additional charge, and, if you are budget-wise, when you are planning
E36 0520 your itinerary, you will take advantage of these free delivery
E36 0530 and collection stations in major cities within the larger European countries.
E36 0540    International Touring Documents are usually provided
E36 0550 with the car as are road maps and touring data. A valid American
E36 0560 driving license is accepted in all countries except Portugal, Spain,
E36 0565 Yugoslavia and Eastern
E36 0570 Europe. If you plan to visit any of these countries,
E36 0580 you can obtain your International Driving Permit before you
E36 0590 leave at a nominal fee- around $3.00. Your insurance, too, with
E36 0600 most agencies, is provided with the car, covering comprehensive fire,
E36 0610 theft, liability and collision with a deductible clause which varies
E36 0620 in different countries. If you would feel happier with full collision
E36 0630 insurance, there is a small additional charge, again varying from country
E36 0640 to country and depending on the term of such insurance. The average
E36 0650 charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly $1.00 a day.
E36 0660 The charge is variable, however, and goes as low as 50@ a day in
E36 0670 Ireland and as high as $2.00 a day in Greece.   Rental fees
E36 0680 are variable, too, throughout the countries of Europe. There are as
E36 0690 many rates as there are countries and models of cars available. As in
E36 0700 the United States, there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus
E36 0710 a few cents per kilometer driven, and the per-day rate drops if the car
E36 0720 is retained for a week. It drops again after fifteen and/or twenty-one
E36 0730 days.   It is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from
E36 0740 80@ to 90@ for the equivalent of a United States gallon and
E36 0750 while you might prefer a familiar Ford, Chevrolet or even a Cadillac,
E36 0760 which are available in some countries, it is probably wiser to choose
E36 0770 the smaller European makes which average thirty, thirty-five and
E36 0780 even forty miles to the gallon.   Your choice of model will undoubtedly
E36 0790 be governed by the number of people travelling in your group.
E36 0800 With the exception of the sports cars, even the quite tiny sedans will
E36 0810 seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage
E36 0820 space for really economical transportation. There is a large variety
E36 0830 of models to choose from in most countries, however, including 6-passenger
E36 0840 sedans and station wagons and the rental fee isn't all that
E36 0850 much greater than for the wee sedans.   The basic costs are generally
E36 0860 pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you
E36 0870 reserve your car, but some of them offer supplementary advantages.
E36 0880 There is the free intra-city "rent it here, leave it there" service,
E36 0900 as an example, the free delivery and collection at the airport, dockside
E36 0910 or your hotel, luggage racks, touring documents and information
E36 0920 and other similar services. A little investigation by telephone or reading
E36 0930 the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these
E36 0940 pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits. The investigation
E36 0950 will be well worth your time.   All model cars are not
E36 0960 available in all countries. Quite naturally, there is a greater availability
E36 0970 of those models which are manufactured within a specific country.
E36 0980 If you would like to start your tour in Italy, where the rental
E36 0990 fees are actually the lowest in Europe, Fiats in all sizes are available,
E36 1000 as are Alfa Romeo Giulietta models. If you wish to budget
E36 1010 closely on transportation, saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries,
E36 1020 one agency lists the small Fiat 500 at only $1.26 a day plus 3@
E36 1025 a kilometer and the Fiat 2100 Station
E36 1030 Wagon, seating six, at just
E36 1040 $1.10 a day and 10-1/2@ a kilometer. If you will be using your car
E36 1050 more than fifteen days, which isn't all unlikely, the daily rates
E36 1060 drop quite sharply to 86@ a day for the Fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal
E36 1070 30@ a day for the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon. With six in the
E36 1080 group, the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily
E36 1090 fee.   In the majority of countries, however, the rates range from
E36 1100 $3.00 to $3.50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7.00
E36 1110 and $8.00 a day for the larger, luxury European models, with the rate
E36 1120 per kilometer driven starting at 3@ and going up as high as 12@.
E36 1130 The same model car might be available in six or eight countries, yet
E36 1140 not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate
E36 1150 or rate per kilometer driven. The variations are not too great. Rates
E36 1160 for American cars are somewhat higher, ranging from about $8.00 a day
E36 1170 up to $14.00 a day for a Chevrolet Convertible, but the rate per
E36 1180 kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger European models.
E36 1190 Rates in Greece and Finland are fairly high, actually the highest
E36 1200 in Europe, and, surprisingly enough, they are also quite high in Ireland.
E36 1210    If you are planning to tour Europe for longer than a
E36 1220 month, it might be wise for you to lease a car. The actual over-all
E36 1230 cost, for the first month, will perhaps not be too much lower than the
E36 1240 rental charges for the same period of time, but you will receive a new
E36 1250 car. You will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner,
E36 1260 which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized
E36 1270 dealers throughout Europe. Further, there is no mileage charge
E36 1280 or mileage limitations when you lease a car, and you pay only the flat
E36 1290 monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since
E36 1300 the car is registered and insured individually for your trip. There is
E36 1310 a fairly wide selection of models of English, German and French manufacture
E36 1320 from which you can choose from the very small Austin 7, Citroe^n
E36 1330 2 ~CV, Volkswagens, Renaults to the 6-passenger Simca
E36 1340 Beaulieu. Leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a
E36 1350 car in Europe, but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical
E36 1360 and satisfactory. After the first month, rates are considerably
E36 1370 less, averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger
E36 1380 models.   There are reasons for some people not wanting to rent
E36 1390 cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan. For one thing, the driver
E36 1400 usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes
E36 1410 pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road. Then,
E36 1420 too, European drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on
E36 1430 the road and some Americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed
E36 1440 up with them. Still there is a way for those who want to see some
E36 1450 of the back country of Europe by car. The way is to rent a chauffeur-driven
E36 1460 car. It isn't as expensive as most people believe it to be.
E36 1470    Your chauffeur's expenses will average between $7.00 to $12.00
E36 1480 a day, but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger
E36 1490 Cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger Peugeot or Fiat 1800. The big
E36 1500 spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven, being governed by
E36 1510 the rate at which gasoline is consumed. Since most European cars average
E36 1520 more miles per gallon of gasoline than American cars, it naturally
E36 1530 follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less,
E36 1540 but the greater seating capacity of the large American cars will equalize
E36 1550 this, provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger
E36 1560 limousine.   The fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars
E36 1570 vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for
E36 1580 the drive-yourself cars. However, whether you arrange to have a European
E36 1590 or American model, if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity
E36 1600 in relation to the number of people in your party, your transportation
E36 1610 expense will average very close to $10.00 per day per passenger.
E36 1620 This will include your helpful, English-speaking chauffeur and a
E36 1630 drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day. If you drive greater
E36 1640 distances than that, you'll just be skimming the surface and will
E36 1650 never discover the enchantment, fascination and beauty which lured
E36 1660 you in the first place to explore the hinterlands. Of course, if you
E36 1670 want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an Imperial or Cadillac
E36 1680 limousine just for you and your bride, you'll have a memorable
E36 1690 tour, but it won't be cheap, and it is not recommended unless you own
E36 1700 a producing oil well or you've had a winner in the Irish Sweepstakes.
