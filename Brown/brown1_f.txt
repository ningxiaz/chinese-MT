F01 0010    In American romance, almost nothing rates higher than what the
F01 0020 movie men have called "meeting cute"- that is, boy-meets-girl
F01 0030 seems more adorable if it doesn't take place in an atmosphere of correct
F01 0040 and acute boredom. Just about the most enthralling real-life example
F01 0050 of meeting cute is the Charles MacArthur-Helen Hayes saga:
F01 0060 reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts, but he said
F01 0070 simultaneously, "I wish they were emeralds". Aside from the comico-romantico
F01 0080 content here, a good linguist-anthropologist could readily
F01 0090 pick up a few other facts, especially if he had a little more of the
F01 0100 conversation to go on.   The way MacArthur said his line- if
F01 0110 you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist- would
F01 0120 probably have gone like this: **f Primary stresses on emeralds and
F01 0130 wish; note pitch 3 (pretty high) on emeralds but with a slight degree
F01 0140 of drawl, one degree of oversoftness **h. Conclusions: The people
F01 0150 involved (and subsequent facts bear me out here) knew clearly the relative
F01 0160 values of peanuts and emeralds, both monetary and sentimental.
F01 0170 And the drawling, oversoft voice of flirtation, though fairly overt,
F01 0180 was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture.   In
F01 0190 other words, like automation machines designed to work in tandem, they
F01 0200 shared the same programming, a mutual understanding not only of English
F01 0210 words, but of the four stresses, pitches, and junctures that can
F01 0220 change their meaning from black to white. At this point, unfortunately,
F01 0230 romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture; but consider,
F01 0240 if you can bear it, what might have happened if MacArthur, for
F01 0250 some perverse, undaunted reason, had made the same remark to an Eskimo
F01 0260 girl in Eskimo. To her peanuts and emeralds would have been just
F01 0270 so much blubber. The point- quite simply- is this: words they
F01 0280 might have had; but communication, no.   This basic principle,
F01 0290 the first in a richly knotted bundle, was conveyed to me by Dr& Henry
F01 0300 Lee Smith, Jr&, at the University of Buffalo, where he heads
F01 0310 the world's first department of anthropology and linguistics. A
F01 0320 brisk, amusing man, apparently constructed on an ingenious system of
F01 0330 spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind, Smith
F01 0340 began his academic career teaching speech to Barnard girls- a project
F01 0350 considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about "a young
F01 0360 rat named Arthur, who never could make up his mind". Later, he
F01 0370 became one of the central spirits of the Army Language Program and
F01 0380 the language school of Washington's Foreign Service Institute.
F01 0390 It was there, in the course of trying to prepare new men for the "culture
F01 0400 shock" they might encounter in remote overseas posts, that he
F01 0410 first began to develop a system of charting the "norms of human communication".
F01 0420    To the trained ear of the linguist, talk has always
F01 0430 revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker-
F01 0440 such things as geographical origin and/or history, socio-economic identity,
F01 0450 education. It is only fairly recently, however, that linguists
F01 0460 have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way
F01 0470 that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure
F01 0480 of human communication between two people. This, for obvious reasons,
F01 0490 makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric
F01 0500 interview, so useful, in fact, that they have been successfully used
F01 0510 to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy.
F01 0520    In the early 1950's, Smith, together with his distinguished
F01 0530 colleague, George Trager (so austerely academic he sometimes
F01 0540 fights his own evident charm), and a third man with the engaging name
F01 0550 of Birdwhistell (Ray), agreed on some basic premises about the three-part
F01 0560 process that makes communication: (1) words or language (2) paralanguage,
F01 0570 a set of phenomena including laughing, weeping, voice breaks,
F01 0580 and "tone" of voice, and (3) kinesics, the technical name for
F01 0590 gestures, facial expressions, and body shifts- nodding or shaking the
F01 0600 head, "talking" with one's hands, et cetera.   Smith's
F01 0610 first workout with stresses, pitches, and junctures was based on mother,
F01 0620 which spells, in our culture, a good deal more than bread alone.
F01 0630 For example, if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person, there are
F01 0640 certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother.
F01 0650 The usual U&S& norm would be: **f Middle pitches, slight
F01 0660 pause (juncture) before mother, slight rise at the end. The symbols
F01 0670 of mother's status, here, are all usual for culture U&S&A&.
F01 0680 Quite other feelings are evidenced by this style: **f Note the
F01 0690 drop to pitch 1 (the lowest) on mother with no rise at the end of the
F01 0700 sentence; this is a "fade" ending, and what you have here is a
F01 0710 downtalking style of speech, expressing something less than conventional
F01 0720 respect for mother. Even less regard for mom and mom's apple pie
F01 0730 goes with: **f In other words, the way the speaker relates to mother
F01 0740 is clearly indicated. And while the meaning of the words is not in
F01 0750 this instance altered, the quality of communication in both the second
F01 0760 and third examples is definitely impaired. An accompanying record
F01 0770 of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a
F01 0780 throaty
F01 0790 rasp. With this seven-word sentence- though the speaker undoubtedly
F01 0800 thought he was dealing only with the subject of food- he was telling
F01 0810 things about himself and, in the last two examples, revealing that
F01 0820 he had departed from the customs of his culture.   The joint investigations
F01 0830 of linguistics and psychiatry have established, in point
F01 0840 of fact, that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words
F01 0850 are involved, it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling
F01 0860 over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate
F01 0870 to the rest of the world. Since interviewing is the basic therapeutic
F01 0880 and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry, the recording of
F01 0890 interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of Redstone proportions
F01 0900 in new research and training. Some of the earliest recordings,
F01 0910 made in the 1940's, demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately
F01 0920 to anger and anxiety in the sound track, whereas written records
F01 0930 of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which- if
F01 0940 they were at all discernible in print- were picked up only by the most
F01 0950 skilled and sensitive experts. In a general way, psychiatrists were
F01 0960 able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt-
F01 0970 that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic, that such
F01 0980 things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not
F01 0990 necessarily by words.   At a minimum, recording- usually on tape,
F01 1000 which is now in wide professional use- brings the psychiatric interview
F01 1010 alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored
F01 1020 repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists. Newest
F01 1030 to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have
F01 1040 carried that minimum to a new level. By adding a systematic analysis
F01 1050 with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews, they have supplied
F01 1060 a new set of techniques for the therapist. Linguistic charting of
F01 1070 the transcribed interview flags points where the patient's voice departs
F01 1080 from expected norms. It flags such possible breakdowns of communication
F01 1090 as rehearsed dialogue, the note of disapproval, ambivalence
F01 1100 or ambiguity, annoyance, resentment, and the disinclination to speak at
F01 1110 all- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences.
F01 1120    Interpretation, naturally, remains the role of the therapist, but
F01 1130 orientation- not only the patient's vocal giveaways of geographical
F01 1140 and socio-economic background, but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways
F01 1150 of danger spots in his relationship to people- can be considerably
F01 1160 beefed up by the linguist. His esoteric chartings of the voice alert
F01 1170 the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying
F01 1180 psychological difficulties, making them apparent first to the
F01 1190 therapist and eventually to the patient. In one now-historic first
F01 1200 interview,
F01 1210 for example, the transcript (reproduced from the book, <The
F01 1220 First Five Minutes>) goes like this: **f The therapist's level
F01 1230 tone is bland and neutral- he has, for example, avoided stressing
F01 1240 "you", which would imply disapproval; or surprise, which would
F01 1250 set the patient apart from other people. The patient, on the other
F01 1260 hand, is far from neutral; aside from her specifically regional accent,
F01 1270 she reveals by the use of the triad, "irritable, tense, depressed",
F01 1280 a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity
F01 1290 with literary or scientific language (i&e&, she must have
F01 1300 had at least a high-school education), and she is telling a story she
F01 1310 has mentally rehearsed some time before. Then she catapults into "everything
F01 1320 and everybody", putting particular violence on "everybody",
F01 1330 indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag- that
F01 1340 is, it is not congruent to the patient's general style of speech up
F01 1350 to this point. Consequently, it is referred to the therapist for attention.
F01 1360 He may then very well conclude that "everybody" is probably
F01 1370 not the true target of her resentment. Immediately thereafter, the
F01 1380 patient fractures her rehearsed story, veering into an oversoft, breathy,
F01 1390 sloppily articulated, "I don't feel like talking right now".
F01 1400    Within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent
F01 1410 to the therapist that "everybody" truthfully refers to the woman's
F01 1420 husband. She says later, but still within the opening five minutes,
F01 1430 "I keep thinking of a divorce but that's another emotional death".
F01 1440    The linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are
F01 1450 all present in the voice chart for this sentence; so are certain
F01 1460 signals that she does not accept divorce. By saying "a<noth>er emotional
F01 1470 death", she reveals that there has been a previous one, although
F01 1480 she has not described it in words. This the therapist may pursue
F01 1481 in
F01 1490 later questioning. The phrase, "emotional death", interesting and,
F01 1500 to a non-scientific mind, rather touching, suggests that this woman
F01 1510 may have some flair for words, perhaps even something of the temperament
F01 1520 regrettably called "creative".   Since the psychiatric interview,
F01 1530 like any other interview, depends on communication, it is significant
F01 1540 to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked
F01 1550 skill and long experience. His own communication apparatus operated
F01 1560 superbly, and Lillian Ross readers will note instantly its total
F01 1570 lack of resemblance to the blunted, monumentally unmeshed mechanism of
F01 1580 Dr& Blauberman. Interestingly enough- although none of the real-life
F01 1590 therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman-
F01 1600 when groups of them began playing back interviews, they discovered
F01 1610 any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview
F01 1620 techniques; almost everyone, on first hearing one of his own sessions
F01 1630 on tape, expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again.
F01 1640    Yet, in spite of this, intensive study of the taped interviews
F01 1650 by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact
F01 1660 that, in the first five minutes of an initial interview, the patient
F01 1670 often reveals as many as a dozen times just what's wrong with him;
F01 1680 to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively
F01 1690 or scientifically how to listen. Naturally, the patient does not say,
F01 1700 "I hate my father", or "Sibling rivalry is what bugs me".
F01 1701 What he <does> do
F01 1710 is give himself away by communicating information over
F01 1720 and above the words involved. Some of the classic indicators, as described
F01 1730 by Drs& Pittenger, Hockett, and Danehy in <The First
F01 1740 Five Minutes>, are these: _AMBIGUITY OF PRONOUNS:_ Stammering
F01 1750 or repetition of <I, you, he, she>, et cetera may signal
F01 1760 ambiguity
F01 1770 or uncertainty. On the other hand significant facts may be concealed-
F01 1780 <she> may mean <I>; or <everybody>, as it did with the tense
F01 1790 and irritable woman mentioned before, may refer to a specific person.
F01 1800 The word that is <not> used can be as important as the word that
F01 1810 <is> used; therapist and/or linguist must always consider the alternatives.
F01 1820 When someone says, for example, "They took ~X rays to
F01 1830 see that there was nothing wrong with me", it pays to consider how
F01 1840 this statement would normally be made. (This patient, in actuality,
F01 1850 was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the
F01 1860 fact
F01 1870 that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty.)
F01 1880 **h Amateur linguists note here that Pursewarden, in Durrell's
F01 1890 Alexandria Quartet, stammered when he spoke of his wife, which
F01 1900 is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship.
F02 0010    @ She was just another freighter from the States, and she seemed
F02 0020 as commonplace as her name. She was the <John Harvey,> one
F02 0030 of those Atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to Bari to bring beans,
F02 0040 bombs, and bullets to the U&S& Fifteenth Air Force, to Field
F02 0050 Marshal Montgomery's Eighth Army then racing up the calf of the
F02 0060 boot of Italy in that early December of 1943.   The <John Harvey>
F02 0070 arrived in Bari, a port on the Adriatic, on November 28th,
F02 0080 making for Porto Nuovo, which, as the name indicates, was the ancient
F02 0090 city's new and modern harbor. Hardly anyone ashore marked her as
F02 0100 she anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole. If anyone thought
F02 0110 of the <John Harvey,> it was to observe that she was straddled by
F02 0120 a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit
F02 0130 the <John Harvey> would likely be blown up with her own ammo and
F02 0140 whatever else it was that she carried.   Which was poison gas.
F02 0150 ## It had required the approval of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt
F02 0160 before the <John Harvey> could be loaded with 100 tons of
F02 0170 mustard gas and despatched to the Italian warfront. For in a world
F02 0180 as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud, poison gas
F02 0190 was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons.   Throughout
F02 0200 the early years of World War /2,, reports persisted that the
F02 0210 Axis powers had used gas- Germany in Russia, Japan in China again.
F02 0220 They were always denied. Influential people in America were warning
F02 0230 the Pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by
F02 0240 the Germans in future campaigns. Some extremists went so far as to
F02 0250 urge our using it first. To silence extremists, to warn the Axis, President
F02 0260 Roosevelt issued this statement for the Allies in August:
F02 0270    "From time to time since the present war began there have
F02 0280 been reports that one or more of the Axis powers were seriously contemplating
F02 0290 use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices
F02 0300 of warfare. I have been loath to believe that any nation, even our
F02 0310 present enemies, could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such
F02 0320 terrible and inhumane weapons.   "However, evidence that the
F02 0330 Axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an
F02 0340 intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety
F02 0350 of sources.   "Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the
F02 0360 general opinion of civilized mankind. This country has not used them,
F02 0370 and I hope that we never will be compelled to use them. I state categorically
F02 0380 that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such
F02 0390 weapons unless they are first used by our enemies".   The
F02 0400 following month the invasion of Italy was begun, and Roosevelt gave
F02 0410 effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in
F02 0420 southern Italy. Bari was chosen as a depot, not only for its seeming
F02 0430 safety, but because of its proximity to airfields. Any retaliatory
F02 0440 gas attack would be airborne. It would be made in three waves- the
F02 0450 first to lay down a smokescreen, the second to drop the gas bombs, the
F02 0460 third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below.
F02 0470    So the vile cargo went into the hole of the <John Harvey>. A
F02 0475 detachment
F02 0480 of six men from the 701st Chemical Maintenance Company under
F02 0490 First Lt& Howard D& Beckstrom went aboard, followed by Lt&
F02 0500 Thomas H& Richardson, the Cargo Security Officer. Secrecy
F02 0510 was paramount. Only a few other people- very important people- knew
F02 0520 of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks. No one else must
F02 0530 know. Thus, in the immemorial way- in the way of the right hand that
F02 0540 knows and the left that does not- was the stage set for tragedy
F02 0550 at Bari.   It was the night of December 2, 1943, and it was growing
F02 0560 dark in Bari. It was getting on toward 7 o'clock and the German
F02 0570 ~Me-210
F02 0580 plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit. Capt&
F02 0590 A& B& Jenks of the Office of Harbor Defense was very
F02 0600 worried. He knew that German long-range bombers had been returning
F02 0610 to the attack in Italy. On November 24th, they had made a raid on La
F02 0620 Maddalena. Two days later, some 30 of them had struck at a convoy
F02 0630 off Bougie, sinking a troopship- and it had been that very night that
F02 0640 the ~Me-210 had made its first appearance. After it had reappeared
F02 0650 the next two nights, Jenks went to higher headquarters and said:
F02 0660    "For three days now a German reconnaissance plane has been
F02 0670 over the city taking pictures. They're just waiting for the proper
F02 0680 time to come over here and dump this place into the Adriatic".
F02 0690    But the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist.
F02 0700 Even though it was known that the Luftwaffe in the north was now
F02 0710 being directed by the young and energetic General Peltz, the commander
F02 0720 who would conduct the "Little Blitz" on London in 1944, a
F02 0730 major raid on Bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered
F02 0740 seriously. True, there had been raids on Naples- but Naples was
F02 0750 pretty far north on the opposite coast. No, Bari was out of range.
F02 0760 More than that, Allied air had complete superiority in the Eighth
F02 0770 Army's sector. So Captain Jenks returned to his harbor post to watch
F02 0780 the scouting plane put in five more appearances, and to feel the
F02 0790 certainty of this dread rising within him. For Jenks knew that Bari's
F02 0800 defenses were made of paper. The Royal Air Force had but a single
F02 0810 light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available. There
F02 0820 were no R&A&F& fighter squadrons on Bari airfield. The
F02 0830 radar station with the best location was still not serviceable. Telephone
F02 0840 communication was bad. And everywhere in evidence among the few
F02 0850 remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster- multiple
F02 0860 command.   It had been made shockingly evident that very morning
F02 0870 to Ensign Kay K& Vesole, in charge of the armed guard aboard the
F02 0880 <John Bascom>. A British officer had come aboard and told him
F02 0890 that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs
F02 0900 were actually dropped. Then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a
F02 0905 radar-controlled
F02 0910 shore gun firing white tracers.   "This harbor is
F02 0920 a bomber's paradise", the Britisher had said with frank grimness.
F02 0930 "It's up to you to protect yourselves. We can't expect any
F02 0940 help from the fighters at Foggia, either. They're all being used on
F02 0950 offensive missions".   Vesole had been stunned. Not fire until
F02 0960 the bombs came down! He thought of the tons and tons of flammable
F02 0970 fluid beneath his feet and shook his head. Like hell! Like hell
F02 0980 he'd wait- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out?
F02 0990 What would his guns guide on then- the North Star? Ensign
F02 1000 Vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering
F02 1010 of the bombs, and when night began to fall, he put Seaman 2/~c Donald
F02 1020 L& Norton and Seaman 1/~c William A& Rochford on the guns
F02 1030 and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette.
F02 1040 Below decks, Seaman 1/~c Stanley Bishop had begun to write
F02 1050 a letter home. ## Above decks on the <John Harvey,> Lieutenant
F02 1060 Richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and
F02 1070 felt uneasy. There were lights glinting in the city, too, even though
F02 1080 it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible. Bari was
F02 1090 asking for it, he thought.   For five days now, they had been
F02 1100 in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold. Richardson wondered
F02 1110 when it would be unloaded. He hoped they would put it somewhere way,
F02 1120 way down in the earth. The burden of his secret was pressing down
F02 1130 on him, as it was on Lieutenant Beckstrom and his six enlisted men.
F02 1140 Lieutenant Richardson could envy the officers and men of the <John
F02 1150 Harvey> in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing
F02 1160 more dangerous than high explosive bombs. They seemed happy at the
F02 1170 delay in unloading, glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty
F02 1180 port such as Bari. Nine of them had gone down the gangplank already.
F02 1190 Deck Cadet James L& Cahill and Seaman Walter Brooks had
F02 1200 been the first to leave. Richardson had returned their departing grins
F02 1210 with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer's stock in
F02 1220 trade.   The other half of the crew, plus Beckstrom and his men,
F02 1230 had remained aboard. Richardson glanced to sea and started slightly.
F02 1240 Damned if that wasn't a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor-
F02 1250 Porto Vecchio. The night was so clear that Richardson had no
F02 1260 difficulty making out the silhouette. Then the thought of a cloudless
F02 1270 sky made him shiver, and he glanced upward. His eyes boggled.
F02 1280    It was a clear night and it was raining!   Capt& Michael
F02 1290 A& Musmanno, Military governor of the Sorrentine Peninsula, had
F02 1300 also seen and felt the "rain". But he had mistaken it for bugs.
F02 1310    Captain Musmanno's renovated schooner with the flamboyant
F02 1320 name <Unsinkable> had just left Porto Vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed
F02 1330 olive oil for the Sorrentine's civilian population. Musmanno
F02 1340 was on deck. At exactly 7:30, he felt a fluttering object brush
F02 1350 his face. He snatched at it savagely. He turned the beam of his flashlight
F02 1360 on it. He laughed. It was the silver foil from the chocolate
F02 1370 bar he had been eating. He frowned. But how could-? Another,
F02 1390 longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth. It was two feet long. It was
F02 1400 not candy wrapping.   It was "window"- the tinsel paper
F02 1410 dropped by bombers to jam radar sets, to fill the scope with hundreds
F02 1420 of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers.   "Fermate"!
F02 1430 Musmanno bellowed to his Italian crewmen. "Stop! Stop
F02 1440 the engines"!   <Unsinkable> slowed and stopped, hundreds
F02 1450 of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black, the air
F02 1460 raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek, the anti-aircraft guns coughed
F02 1470 and chattered- and above it all motors roared and the bombs came
F02 1480 whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor
F02 1490 at Bari.   They had come from airports in the Balkans, these
F02 1500 hundred-odd Junkers 88's. They had winged over the Adriatic, they
F02 1510 had taken Bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her,
F02 1520 attacking with deadly skill. They had ruined the radar warning system
F02 1530 with their window, they had made themselves invisible above their flares.
F02 1540 And they also had the lights of the city, the port wall lanterns,
F02 1550 and a shore crane's spotlight to guide on. After the first two
F02 1560 were blacked out, the third light was abandoned by a terrified Italian
F02 1570 crew, who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring
F02 1580 homing beacon until British ~MP's shot it out.   In that
F02 1590 interval, the German bombers made a hell of Bari harbor.   Merchant
F02 1600 ships illuminated in the light of the flares, made to seem like
F02 1610 stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud, were impossible to miss.
F02 1620 The little <Unsinkable> sank almost immediately. Captain Musmanno
F02 1630 roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for
F02 1640 a raft. They got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few
F02 1650 minutes before their schooner went under.   <John Bascom>
F02 1660 went down early, too. Ensign Vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly,
F02 1670 but they had no targets. Most of the Junkers were above the
F02 1680 blinding light of the flares, and the radar-controlled shore gun had
F02 1690 been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs. Vesole rushed
F02 1700 from gun to gun, attempting to direct fire. He was wounded, but fought
F02 1710 on. Norton and Rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors.
F02 1720 Bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20~mm gun, pumping out 400 rounds
F02 1730 before sticks of three bombs each crashed into Holds One, Three and
F02 1740 Five. Now the <Bascom> was mortally wounded. Luckily, she was
F02 1750 not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt.
F02 1760    The order to abandon ship was given, but cries of pain could
F02 1770 be heard from the wounded below decks.
F03 0010    THERE IS a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at
F03 0020 you, wondering why you are staring, open-mouthed in amazement. You explain,
F03 0030 "I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this
F03 0040 very same event before. I can't tell when, but I'm positive I witnessed
F03 0050 this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in
F03 0060 the past"!   This experience will have happened to many of
F03 0070 you.   Emerson, in his lecture, refers to the "**h startling experience
F03 0080 which almost every person confesses in daylight, that particular
F03 0090 passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same
F03 0100 order before, whether dreaming or waking, a suspicion that they have
F03 0110 been with precisely these persons in precisely this room, and heard
F03 0120 precisely this dialogue, at some former hour, they know not when".
F03 0130    Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling
F03 0140 as the <deja vue (already seen)> illusion, just as they dismiss
F03 0150 dream previsions as coincidences. In this manner they side-step the seemingly
F03 0160 hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which
F03 0170 all of us grope continually.   When a man recognizes a certain
F03 0180 experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream, we have an instance
F03 0185 of <deja vue>,
F03 0190 except for the fact that he knows just why the experience
F03 0200 seems familiar. Occasionally there are examples of prevision
F03 0210 which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude.
F03 0220    One day Maeterlinck, coming with a friend upon an event
F03 0230 which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream, detailed
F03 0240 the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion
F03 0250 was completely mystified.   Rudyard Kipling's scorn for the "jargon"
F03 0260 of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered
F03 0270 "**h how, or why, had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life
F03 0280 film"? The famous author tells us of the strange incident in <Something
F03 0290 About Myself>.   One day when he attended a war memorial
F03 0300 ceremony in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout
F03 0310 man on his left, his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the
F03 0320 rough slab flooring and someone, clasping him by the arm, whispered,
F03 0330 "I want a word with you, please". At that moment Kipling was
F03 0340 overwhelmed with awed amazement, suddenly recalling that these identical
F03 0350 details of scene, action and word had occurred to him in a dream six
F03 0360 weeks earlier.   Freud probably contributed more than anyone else
F03 0370 to the understanding of dreams, enabling us to recognize their equivalents
F03 0380 in our wakeful thoughts. However, readers who accept Freud's
F03 0390 findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of
F03 0400 dreams, should ponder over the following words in his <Interpretation
F03 0410 Of Dreams,> Chapter /1,: "**h as a matter of fact no such
F03 0420 complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case,
F03 0430 and what is more, every one attempting such solution has found that
F03 0440 in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream
F03 0450 the source of which he has been unable to explain **h nor is the discussion
F03 0460 closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams".
F03 0470    Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy, clairvoyance,
F03 0480 prevision and retrovision. <The basic mystery of dreams, which embraces
F03 0490 all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical
F03 0500 dream, is in the fact that they are original, visual continuities>.
F03 0510    I recall the startling, vivid realism of a dream in which I
F03 0515 lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town. I am
F03 0520 sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence,
F03 0530 so complete in detail, from the hodge-podge of news pictures
F03 0540 I have seen. And when psychology explains glibly, "but the subconscious
F03 0550 mind is able to produce it" it refers to a mental region so vaguely
F03 0560 identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably
F03 0570 as part of the individual mind.   Skeptics may deny the
F03 0580 more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally
F03 0590 observed, but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance
F03 0600 of routine evidence.   The question becomes, "What is
F03 0610 a dream"?   Is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie?
F03 0620    Every dream, and this is true of a mental image of any type
F03 0630 even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful
F03 0640 thought, is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available.
F03 0650 In most cases we recognize certain words, persons, animals or objects.
F03 0660 But these are dreamed in original action, in some particular continuity
F03 0670 which we don't remember having seen in real life. For instance,
F03 0680 the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and, with
F03 0690 photographic realism, sees Smith driving the car; whereas, it is
F03 0700 a matter of fact that Smith cannot drive a car. There is nothing to
F03 0710 suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original,
F03 0720 realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams.
F03 0730    The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of
F03 0740 a mental image can find no logical support. <A "mental image" subconsciously
F03 0750 impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful
F03 0760 thought, or consciously in light sleep, is actually not an image at
F03 0770 all but is comprised of realities, viewed not in the concurrent sensory
F03 0780 stream, but within the depths of the fourth dimension>.   Dreams
F03 0790 that display events of the future with photographic detail call
F03 0800 for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components, including
F03 0810 that weird feeling of <deja vue>, inevitably fantastic though
F03 0820 that theory must seem.   As in the theory of perception, established
F03 0830 in psycho-physiology, the eye is recognized as an integral part
F03 0840 of the brain. But then this theory confesses that it is completely at
F03 0850 a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain. The
F03 0860 opening paragraph of the chapter titled <The Theory Of Representative
F03 0870 Perception,> in the book <Philosophies Of Science> by
F03 0880 Albert G& Ramsperger says, "**h passed on to the brain, and there,
F03 0890 by some unexplained process, it causes the mind to have a perception".
F03 0900    But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image
F03 0910 within the brain? As retinal images are conceded to be an integral
F03 0920 function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves, between
F03 0930 the inner brain and the eyes, carry the direct drive for cooperation
F03 0940 from the various brain centers- rather than to theorize on the
F03 0945 transmission
F03 0950 of an image which is already in required location. Hereby,
F03 0960 the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen,
F03 0970 not the retinal image, the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive
F03 0980 cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory
F03 0990 centers, motor tensions, associated word symbols, and consciousness.
F03 1000    Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists
F03 1010 of minute waves of energy. We know that the number of radio and
F03 1020 television impulses, sound waves, ultra-violet rays, etc&, that may
F03 1025 occupy
F03 1030 the very same space, each solitary upon its own frequency, is infinite.
F03 1040 So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal,
F03 1050 apparently momentary states of matter, successive one after
F03 1060 another in consciousness, but permanent each on its own basic phase of
F03 1070 the progressive frequencies. This theory makes it possible for any
F03 1080 event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to
F03 1090 consciousness.   Space in any form is completely measured by the
F03 1100 three dimensions. If the fourth dimension is a physical concept and
F03 1110 not purely metaphysical, through what medium does it extend? It is
F03 1120 not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science
F03 1130 fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past,
F03 1140 or the ever-existent past-fantasy future. Three seconds flat is the
F03 1150 usual time, and the space is crossed by moderate mileage, while the
F03 1160 overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static
F03 1170 pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which
F03 1180 perpetuate all events.   The body, senses and brain, in common with
F03 1190 all matter, have their counterpart on each of a countless number of
F03 1200 frequencies. The senses in each counterpart bear the impression only
F03 1210 of phenomena that share its own frequency, whereas those upon all other
F03 1220 frequencies are invisible, inaudible and intactible to them. Consciousness
F03 1230 is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory
F03 1240 impressions. When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the
F03 1250 wakeful world, it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present
F03 1260 past and future, in a life as vibrant and real as the one left
F03 1270 when the body tired and required sleep.   If the photographically
F03 1280 realistic continuity of dreams, however bizarre their combinations,
F03 1290 denies that it is purely a composition of the brain, it must be compounded
F03 1300 from views of diverse realities, although some of them may never
F03 1310 be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life.   Dr&
F03 1320 H& V& Hilprecht, Professor of Assyrian at the University
F03 1330 of Pennsylvania, dreamed that a Babylonian priest, associated with
F03 1340 the king Kurigalzu, (1300 B&C&) escorted him to the treasure
F03 1350 chamber of the temple of Bel, gave him six novel points of information
F03 1360 about a certain broken relic, and corrected an error in its identification.
F03 1370 As a matter of fact, the incorrect classification, the result
F03 1380 of many weeks of labor by Dr& Hilprecht, was about to be published
F03 1390 by him the following day. Some time later the missing part of the relic
F03 1400 was found and the complete inscription, together with other new evidence,
F03 1410 fully corroborated the ancient priest's information. Dr&
F03 1420 Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest
F03 1430 in his dream. He was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite,
F03 1440 and imagined it must have been German or English.   We may
F03 1450 conclude that all six points of information, ostensibly given by the
F03 1460 dream priest, <could have> been furnished by Dr& Hilprecht's
F03 1470 <subconscious> reasoning. But, in denying any physical reality for
F03 1480 this dream, how could the brain possibly compose that realistic, vividly
F03 1490 visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout, violent break or
F03 1500 sudden substitution? Which theory is more fantastic: 1. that the
F03 1510 perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions
F03 1520 in the professor's brain, or 2. that the dream was a reality on the
F03 1530 infinite progressions of universal, gradient frequencies, across which
F03 1540 the modern professor and the priest of ancient Nippur met?
F03 1550    The degree of circumstance, the ratio of memory to forgetfulness, determines
F03 1560 whether a dream will be a recognized, fulfilled prevision, or
F03 1570 the vaguely, effective source of the weird <deja vue> feeling. No
F03 1580 doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the
F03 1590 sleeper's mind. Probably less than one percent of our previsions
F03 1600 escape final obliteration before we wake. When we arrive at the events
F03 1610 concerned in the vanished majority, they, of course, cannot impress
F03 1620 us as anything familiar. Nevertheless, there are notably frequent
F03 1630 instances of <deja vue,> in which our recognition of an entirely novel
F03 1640 event is a feeling of having lived through it before, a feeling which,
F03 1650 though vague, withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive
F03 1660 corps of psychologists. If <deja vue> is an illusion, then peculiarly,
F03 1670 it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most
F03 1680 level-headed people.   Chauncey Depew, one-time runner-up for
F03 1690 the Republican Presidential nomination, was attending a convention
F03 1700 at Saratoga, where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel Theodore Roosevelt
F03 1710 for Governor of New York when he noticed that the temporary
F03 1720 chairman was a man he had never met. After the preliminary business
F03 1730 affair was finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech
F03 1740 that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt. If Depew had told any
F03 1750 academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through
F03 1760 that identical convention session at some time in the past, he would
F03 1770 have been informed that he was a victim of <deja vue>. But the famous
F03 1780 orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene. He remembered
F03 1790 exactly when he had lived through it before, and he had something
F03 1800 to prove he had.   One week before the convention, Depew was
F03 1810 seated on the porch of a country home on the Hudson, gazing at the opposite
F03 1820 shore.
F04 0010    "THE FOOD IS WONDERFUL and it is a lot of fun to be here"!
F04 0020    So wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents
F04 0030 from North Country School, Lake Placid, New York. In this
F04 0040 one sentence, he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition
F04 0050 and psychological programs in operation at the school.   Because
F04 0060 the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value, care
F04 0070 for its origin, and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients,
F04 0080 the food <does> taste good. When served in a psychological
F04 0090 atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from
F04 0100 what they eat because they are free from tension, a foundation is laid
F04 0110 for a high level of health that releases the children from physical
F04 0120 handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments, the
F04 0130 athletic programs and the most important phase, the educational opportunities.
F04 0140    Situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain
F04 0150 scenery in the country, the school buildings are located amid open
F04 0151 fields
F04 0160 and farm lands. These contemporary structures, beautifully adapted to
F04 0170 a school in the country, are home to 60 children, ages eight to fourteen,
F04 0180 grades four through eight. From fourteen states and three foreign
F04 0190 countries they come to spend the months from mid-September to June.
F04 0200    The Director, Walter E& Clark, believes that a school
F04 0210 with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility
F04 0220 for their welfare. To him this means caring for the whole child,
F04 0230 providing basic nutrition, and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom
F04 0240 for the development of the mind. #IMPROVED FARMING METHODS# The
F04 0250 concept of good nutrition really began with the garden. The school has
F04 0260 always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school. In a climate
F04 0270 hostile to agriculture, Mr& Clark has had to keep alert to the
F04 0280 most productive farm techniques.   Where a growing season may,
F04 0290 with luck, allow 60 days without frost, and where the soil is poor,
F04 0300 sandy, quick-drying and subject to erosion, many farmers fail. Throughout
F04 0310 the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear
F04 0320 ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat.   Mr& Clark
F04 0330 found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing, use of chemical fertilizers
F04 0340 and insecticides, plus the application of conservation principles
F04 0350 of rotation and contouring, did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato
F04 0360 fields and depreciation of the soil.   "To give up these
F04 0370 notions required a revolution in thought", Mr& Clark said in reminiscing
F04 0380 about the abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began
F04 0390 reading "Organic Gardening" and "Modern Nutrition" in a
F04 0400 search for help with his problems.   "Louis Bromfield's writings
F04 0410 excited me as a conservationist". By 1952 he was convinced he
F04 0420 would no longer spray. He locked his equipment in a cabinet where it
F04 0430 still remains. After reading "Plowman's Folly" by Edward H&
F04 0440 Faulkner, he stopped plowing.   The basis for compost materials
F04 0450 already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the
F04 0460 riding program, poultry for eggs, pigs to eat garbage, a beef herd
F04 0470 and wastes of all kinds. Separate pails were kept in the kitchen for
F04 0480 coffee grounds and egg shells.   All these materials and supplementary
F04 0490 manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry
F04 0500 farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year. It was applied
F04 0510 with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader.
F04 0520 Years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed
F04 0530 the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity. Soon after
F04 0540 the method changed, visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate
F04 0550 his soil to keep it looking moist, when in reality, it was the soil treatment
F04 0560 alone that accomplished this.   To demonstrate the soil
F04 0570 of his vegetable gardens as it is today, Mr& Clark stooped to scoop
F04 0580 up a handful of rich dark earth. Sniffing its sweet smell and letting
F04 0590 it fall to show its good crumbly consistency, he pointed to the nearby
F04 0600 driveway and said, "This soil used to be like that hard packed
F04 0610 road over there".   "People and soils respond slowly", says
F04 0620 Walter Clark, "but the time has now come when the gardens produce
F04 0630 delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment program. No
F04 0640 chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are
F04 0650 used".   The garden supplies enough carrots, turnips, rutabagas,
F04 0660 potatoes, beets, cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the
F04 0670 root cellar. The carrots sometimes don't make it through the winter;
F04 0680 the cabbage and squash keep until March or April. There is never
F04 0690 enough corn, peas or strawberries.   Mr& Clark still has
F04 0700 to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields, but he
F04 0710 has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued
F04 0720 use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in
F04 0730 the
F04 0740 future. A new project planned is the use of Bio-Dynamic Starter.
F04 0750    New ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil
F04 0760 treatment. "After the soil, the kitchen", says Mr& Clark. The
F04 0770 first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of
F04 0780 white bread.   "Adults take a long time to convince and you are
F04 0790 thwarted if you try to push". At first the kitchen help was tolerant,
F04 0800 but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves. "You
F04 0810 can't make French toast with whole-wheat bread", was an early
F04 0820 complaint. Of course they learned in time that they not only could use
F04 0830 whole-wheat bread, but the children liked it better. #HOMEMADE BREAD#
F04 0840 Mrs& Clark, as house manager, planned the menus and cared for
F04 0850 the ordering. Then Miss Lillian Colman came from Vermont to be
F04 0860 kitchen manager. Today whole grains are freshly ground every day and
F04 0870 baked into bread. Mr& Clark's studies taught him that the only
F04 0880 way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the
F04 0890 flour. Once the grains are ground, vitamin ~E begins to deteriorate
F04 0900 immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the
F04 0910 air within one week.   A mill stands in a room off the kitchen.
F04 0920 Surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in
F04 0930 the state. Miss Colman pours measures of whole wheat, oats, and soy
F04 0940 beans and turns on the motor. She goes on about her work and listens
F04 0950 for the completion of the grinding. The bread baked from this mixture
F04 0960 is light in color and fragrant in aroma. It is well liked by the children
F04 0970 and faculty.   There is one problem with the bread. "Lillian's
F04 0980 bread is so good and everything tastes so much better here
F04 0990 that it is hard not to eat too much", said the secretary ruefully eyeing
F04 1000 her extra pounds. #HOT, FRESHLY-GROUND CEREAL# The school has
F04 1010 not used cold prepared cereals for years, though at one time that was
F04 1020 all they ever served. When the chance came, they first eliminated
F04 1030 cold cereal once a week, then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground
F04 1040 cereal every day.   They serve cracked wheat, oats or cornmeal.
F04 1050 Occasionally, the children find steamed, whole-wheat grains for cereal
F04 1060 which they call "buckshot". At the beginning of the school year,
F04 1070 the new students don't eat the cereal right away, but within a short
F04 1080 time they are eating it voraciously.   When they leave for vacations
F04 1090 they miss the hot cereal. The school has received letters from
F04 1100 parents asking, "What happened to Johnny? He never used to like
F04 1110 any hot cereal, now that's the only kind he wants. Where can we
F04 1120 get this cereal he likes so much"? #BODY-BUILDING FOODS# Salads
F04 1130 are served at least once a day. Vegetables are served liberally. Most
F04 1140 come from the root cellar or from the freezer. Home-made sauerkraut
F04 1150 is served once a week. Sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads
F04 1160 and dishes such as chop suey. Sometimes sprouted wheat is added to
F04 1170 bread and causes the children to remark, "Lillian, did you put nuts
F04 1180 in the bread today"?   Milk appears twice a day. The school
F04 1190 raises enough poultry, pigs, and beef cattle for most of their needs.
F04 1200 Lots of cheese made from June grass milk is served. Hens are kept
F04 1210 on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility.
F04 1220    Organ meats such as beef and chicken liver, tongue and heart are
F04 1230 planned once a week. Also, salt water fish is on the table once a week.
F04 1240    For deserts, puddings and pies are each served once a week.
F04 1250 Most other desserts are fruit in some form, fresh fruits once daily
F04 1260 at least, sometimes at snack time. Dried fruits are purchased from sources
F04 1270 where they are neither sulphured nor sprayed. Apples come
F04 1271 from
F04 1280 a farm in Vermont where they are not sprayed. Oranges and grapefruit
F04 1290 are shipped from Florida weekly from an organic farm.   Finding
F04 1300 sources for these high quality foods is a problem. Sometimes the
F04 1310 solution comes in unexpected ways. Following a talk by Mr& Clark
F04 1320 at the New York State Natural Food Associates Convention, a man
F04 1330 from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school
F04 1340 from Vermont.   Wheat-germ, brewer's yeast and ground kelp are
F04 1350 used in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce, meat loaves. Miss
F04 1360 Colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available
F04 1370 at the tables. Raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table
F04 1380 for the children to help themselves.   Very few fried foods are
F04 1390 used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged. Drinking with meals
F04 1400 is also discouraged; pitchers of water merely appear on the tables.
F04 1410    Nothing is peeled. The source is known so there is no necessity
F04 1420 to remove insecticide residues. The cooking conserves a maximum
F04 1430 of the vitamin ~C content of vegetables by methods which use very
F04 1440 little water and cook in the shortest time possible. #WHOLESOME SNACKS,
F04 1450 NO CANDY# Since Mr& Clark believes firmly that the chewing
F04 1460 of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth, raw vegetables and
F04 1470 raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat
F04 1480 cookies at snack time in the afternoons. To solve the problem of the
F04 1490 wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot, a ball of
F04 1500 maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains.
F04 1510    On their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains, the children
F04 1520 carry whole grains to munch along the trail. They learn to like
F04 1540 these so well that it isn't surprising to hear that one boy tried the
F04 1550 oats he was feeding his horse at chore time. They tasted good to him,
F04 1560 so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk
F04 1570 and honey.   Maple syrup is made by the children in the woods
F04 1580 on the school grounds. This and raw sugar replace ordinary refined sugar
F04 1590 on the tables and very little sugar is used in cooking. Candy is
F04 1600 not allowed. Parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats
F04 1610 consisting of fruit and nuts, but no candy. #NOURISHING MEALS#
F04 1620 Mr& Clark believes in a good full breakfast of fruit, hot cereal,
F04 1630 milk, honey, whole-wheat toast with real butter and eggs. The heavy
F04 1640 meal comes in the middle of the day. Soup is often the important dish
F04 1650 at supper. Homemade of meat, bones and vegetables, it is rich in dissolved
F04 1660 minerals and vitamins.   The school finds that the children
F04 1670 are satisfied with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high
F04 1680 in quality. The cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a
F04 1690 day. #OUTDOOR EXERCISES# Even before he saw the necessity of growing
F04 1700 better food and planning good nutrition, Mr& Clark felt the school
F04 1710 had a good health program. Rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and
F04 1720 a half every day in all kinds of weather was the rule. A vigorous
F04 1730 program existed in skiing, skating sports and overnight hiking. #HEALTHIER
F04 1740 CHILDREN# Since the change to better nutrition, he feels he
F04 1750 can report on improvements in health, though he considers the following
F04 1760 statements observations and not scientific proof.   Visitors to
F04 1770 the school ask what shampoo they use on the children's hair to bring
F04 1780 out the sheen. The ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment.
F05 0010    BUFFETED by swirling winds, the little green biplane struggled
F05 0020 northward between the mountains beyond Northfield Gulf. Wires
F05 0030 whined as a cold November blast rocked the silver wings, but the engine
F05 0040 roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit. He
F05 0050 peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again
F05 0060 below.   "Good old iron compass"! he thought.   A plume
F05 0070 of smoke rose from a Central Vermont locomotive which idled behind
F05 0080 a string of gravel cars, and little figures that were workmen labored
F05 0090 to set the ruptured roadbed to rights. The girders of a shattered
F05 0100 Dog River bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream. Vermont's
F05 0110 main railroad line was prostrate. And in the dark days after the Great
F05 0120 Flood of 1927- the worst natural disaster in the state's
F05 0125 history-
F05 0130 the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the United
F05 0150 States mails.   Rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen
F05 0160 for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of Friday,
F05 0170 November 4, 1927, when officials of the Post Office Department's
F05 0180 Railway Mail Service realized that their distribution system for
F05 0190 Vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight. Clerks and postmasters
F05 0200 shoveled muck out of their offices- those who still had offices-
F05 0210 and wondered how to move the mail. The state's railroad system
F05 0220 counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way: it would
F05 0230 obviously remain out of commission for weeks. And once medicine,
F05 0240 food, clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood's victims,
F05 0250 communications and the mail were the next top problems.   From
F05 0260 Burlington, outgoing mail could be ferried across Lake Champlain
F05 0270 to the railroad at Port Kent, N& Y&. But what came in was piling
F05 0280 up. The nearest undisrupted end of track from Boston was at Concord,
F05 0290 N& H&. When Governor Al Smith offered New York National
F05 0300 Guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state, it seemed
F05 0310 a likely temporary solution, easing Burlington's bottleneck and that
F05 0320 at Montpelier too.   The question was "Where to land"?
F05 0330 There was no such thing as an airport in Vermont. Burlington aviator
F05 0340 John J& Burns suggested the parade ground southwest of Fort
F05 0350 Ethan Allen, and soon a dozen hastily-summoned National Guard pilots
F05 0360 were bringing their wide-winged "Jenny" and DeHaviland two-seaters
F05 0370 to rest on the frozen sod of the military base.   The only
F05 0380 available field that could be used near flood-ravaged Montpelier was
F05 0390 on the Towne farm off upper Main Street, a narrow hillside where
F05 0400 takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions.
F05 0410 Over in Barre the streets had been deep in swirling water, and
F05 0420 bridges were crumpled and gone. Anticipating delivery of medicines
F05 0430 and yeast by plane, Granite City citizens formed an airfield committee
F05 0440 and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd Infantry, Vermont National
F05 0450 Guard, laid out runways on Wilson flat, high on Millstone Hill.
F05 0460 The "Barre Aviation Field" was set to receive its first
F05 0470 aircraft the Sunday following the flood.   Though the makeshift
F05 0480 airports were ready, the York State Guard flyers proved unable to
F05 0490 keep any kind of mail schedule. They had courage but their meager training
F05 0500 consisted of weekend hops in good weather, in and out of established
F05 0510 airports, And the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with
F05 0520 the water cooled engines of their World War /1, planes. It seemed
F05 0530 like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering
F05 0540 the post office department to contract for the transport of first
F05 0550 class mail by air. They had to act fast, for letters were clogging the
F05 0560 terminals.   Down in Concord, New Hampshire, was a flier
F05 0570 in the right place at the right time: Robert S& Fogg, a native
F05 0580 New Englander, had been a World War /1, flying instructor, barnstormer,
F05 0590 and one of the original planners of the Concord Airport. Tall,
F05 0600 wiry, dark-haired Bob Fogg had already racked up one historical
F05 0610 first in air mail history. Piloting a Curtiss Navy ~MF flying
F05 0620 boat off Lake Winnipesaukee in 1925, he had inaugurated the original
F05 0630 Rural Delivery air service in America.   During the excitement
F05 0640 following Lindbergh's flight to Paris earlier in 1927, dare devil
F05 0650 aviators overnight became legendary heroes. In Concord, Bob
F05 0660 Fogg
F05 0670 was the most prominent New Hampshire boy with wings. Public-spirited
F05 0680 backers staked him to a brand-new airplane, aimed at putting their
F05 0690 city and state on the flying map. The ship was a Waco biplane, one
F05 0700 of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled, 225~HP
F05 0710 Wright radial engine known as the Whirlwind. A trim green and silver-painted
F05 0720 craft only 22-1/2 feet long, the Waco was entered to
F05 0730 compete in the "On-to-Spokane" Air Derby of 1927. As a matter
F05 0740 of fact, Fogg and his plane didn't get beyond Pennsylvania in the
F05 0750 race- an engine oil leak forced him down- but the flying service
F05 0760 and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his
F05 0770 wry-faced backers. So with all this experience, Bob Fogg was a natural
F05 0780 choice to receive the first Emergency Air Mail Star Route contract.
F05 0790 His work began just six days after the flood.   By airline
F05 0800 from Concord to Burlington is a distance of about 150 miles, counting
F05 0810 a slight deviation for the stop at either Barre or Montpelier.
F05 0820 The first few days Bob Fogg set his plane down on Towne field back
F05 0830 of the State House when the wind was right, and used Wilson flat
F05 0840 above Barre when it wasn't. Between the unsafe Towne field and the
F05 0850 long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to
F05 0860 Wilson flat, arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory.
F05 0870 Each time in, the unhappy pilot, pushing his luck, begged the postal
F05 0880 officials that met him to find a safer landing place, preferably
F05 0890 on the flat-topped hills across the Winooski River.   "But
F05 0900 Fogg", they countered, "we can't get over there. And besides you
F05 0910 seem to make it all right here". It took a tragedy to bring things
F05 0920 to a head. After a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind
F05 0930 takeoffs, Fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage
F05 0940 of an Army plane strewn across snow-covered Towne field. Sent to
F05 0950 Montpelier by Secretary Herbert Hoover, Red Cross Aide Reuben
F05 0960 Sleight had been killed, and his pilot, Lt& Franklin Wolfe, badly
F05 0970 injured. With the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply
F05 0980 flown into the hillside.   Faced with this situation, Postmaster
F05 0990 Charles F& McKenna of Montpelier went with Fogg on a Burlington
F05 1000 trip, and together they scouted the terrain on the heights
F05 1010 of Berlin. A long flat known as the St& John field seemed to answer
F05 1020 their purpose, and since the Winooski bridges were at last passable,
F05 1030 they decided to use it.   With a wary eye on the farmer's
F05 1040 bull, Fred Somers of Montpelier and Mr& St& John marked the
F05 1050 field with a red table cloth. As a wind direction indicator, they tied
F05 1060 a cotton rag to a sapling. With these aids, and a pair of skiis substituting
F05 1070 for wheels on the Waco, Bob Fogg made the first landing on
F05 1080 what is now part of the Barre-Montpelier Airport on November 21,
F05 1090 1927.   Each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail
F05 1100 pouches. During the second week of operations, Fogg received a telegram
F05 1110 from the Post Office Department, asking him to "put on two airplanes
F05 1120 and make two flights daily, plus one Sunday trip". Since
F05 1130 Fogg's was a one-man, one-plane flying service, this meant that he
F05 1140 would have to do both trips, flying alone 600 miles a day, under sub-freezing
F05 1150 temperature conditions.   Over the weeks, America's
F05 1160 first Star Route Air Mail settled into a routine pattern despite the
F05 1170 vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation.
F05 1180 Each morning at five Fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into
F05 1190 flying togs over the furnace register of his home. Always troubled
F05 1200 by poor circulation in his feet, he experimented with various combinations
F05 1210 of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer's
F05 1220 boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them. A sheep-lined
F05 1230 leather flying suit, plus helmet, goggles and mittens completed
F05 1240 his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit. The airman's stock answer
F05 1250 to "Weren't you cold"? became "Yes, the first half hour
F05 1260 is tough, but by then I'm so numb I don't notice it"!
F05 1270    As daylight began to show through the frosty windows, Fogg would
F05 1280 place a call to William A& Shaw at the U& S& Weather Station
F05 1290 at Northfield, Vermont, for temperature and wind-velocity readings.
F05 1300 Shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility
F05 1310 by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station.
F05 1320 "Ceilings" were judged by comparison with known mountain heights
F05 1330 and cloud positions. Later on in the day Fogg could get a better weather
F05 1340 picture from the Burlington Weather Bureau supervised by Frank
F05 1350 E& Hartwell.   Out at the airport each morning, Fogg's
F05 1360 skilled mechanic Caleb Marston would have the Waco warmed up and running
F05 1370 in the drafty hangar. (He'd get the engine oil flowing with an
F05 1380 electric heater under a big canvas cover.) Wishing to show that aviation
F05 1390 was dependable and here to stay, Bob Fogg always made a point
F05 1400 of taking off each morning on the dot of seven, disregarding rain, snow
F05 1410 and sleet in true postal tradition. Concord learned to set its clocks
F05 1420 by the rackety bark of the Whirlwind's exhaust overhead. Sometimes
F05 1430 the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog, but 85% of his
F05 1440 trips were completed.   Plane radios were not yet available,
F05 1450 and once in the air, Fogg flew his ship by compass, a good memory for
F05 1460 landmarks as seen from above, and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick
F05 1470 computation. Often, threading through the overcast, he was forced
F05 1480 to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling, skimming above the Winooski
F05 1490 or the White River along the line of the broken railroad. When
F05 1500 driving rain or mist socked in one valley, Fogg would chandelle up
F05 1510 and over to reverse course and try another one, ranging from the Ottauquechee
F05 1520 up to Danville in search of safe passage through the mountain
F05 1530 passes.   The dependable Wright engine was never stopped on
F05 1540 these trips. It ticked over smoothly, idling while Fogg exchanged
F05 1550 mails with the armed messenger from Burlington at Fort Ethan Allen,
F05 1560 and one from Montpelier and Barre at the St& John field.
F05 1570    Sometimes, on a return trip, the aviator would "go upstairs" high
F05 1580 over the clouds. There he'd take a compass heading, figure his
F05 1590 air speed, and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he'd be over
F05 1600 the broad meadows of the Merrimack Valley where it would be safe
F05 1610 to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him.
F05 1620 Bob Fogg didn't have today's advantages of Instrument Flight
F05 1630 and Ground Control Approach systems. At the end of the calculated
F05 1640 time he'd nose the Waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break
F05 1650 through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable.
F05 1660    Usually back in Concord by noon, there was just time
F05 1670 to get partially thawed out, refuel, and grab a bit of Mrs& Fogg's
F05 1680 hot broth before starting the second trip. Day after day Fogg shuttled
F05 1690 back and forth on his one-man air mail route, until the farmers
F05 1700 in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the
F05 1710 stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country.   The
F05 1720 flyer had his share of near-misses. At Fort Ethan Allen the ever-present
F05 1730 wind off Lake Champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing
F05 1740 like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated. Once the soldiers from
F05 1750 the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while Fogg revved
F05 1760 the engine and got the tail up. At a nod of his head they let go,
F05 1770 turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream. Tracks in the
F05 1780 snow showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred feet.
F05 1790    One afternoon during a cold, powdery snowstorm, Fogg took off for
F05 1800 Concord from the St& John field.
F06 0010 {A}re you retiring now? If so, are you saying, "Where did
F06 0015 the last
F06 0020 few years go? How did I get to be sixty-five so fast? What do
F06 0030 I do now"?   Yes, retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly.
F06 0040 Somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire. We always
F06 0050 thought we would die with our boots on. Out of the blue comes talk
F06 0060 of pension plans. Compulsory retirement at sixty-five looms on our
F06 0070 horizon. Still, it seems in the far future. Suddenly, one day, up it
F06 0080 pops! Sixty-five years and you've had it!   So, now what?
F06 0090 Oh sure! You've thought about it before in a hazy sort of way.
F06 0100 But! It never seemed real; never seemed as if it could happen
F06 0110 to you; only to the other fellow.   Now! Here it is! How
F06 0120 am I going to live? What am I going to do? Where do I go from
F06 0130 here?   A great many retired people are the so-called white
F06 0140 collar workers. Are you one of these?   If so, you are of the
F06 0150 old school. You are conscientious, hard working, honest, accurate,
F06 0160 a good penman, and a stickler for a job well done, with no loose ends.
F06 0170 Everything must balance to the last penny. Also you can spell, without
F06 0180 consulting a dictionary for every other word. You never are late
F06 0190 for work and seldom absent. ## {Actually, you can take no special
F06 0200 credit for this.} It is the way you were taught and your way of
F06 0210 life. All this is standard equipment for a man of your day; your stock
F06 0220 in trade; your livelihood.   However, the last few years
F06 0230 of your life, things seem to be changing. Your way doesn't seem to
F06 0240 be so darned important any more. You realize you are getting in the old
F06 0250 fogy class. To put it bluntly, you are getting out-moded.   What's
F06 0260 happened? The answer is a new era.   Now, looming on
F06 0270 the horizon are such things as estimated totals, calculated risks and
F06 0280 I&B&M& machines. The Planning Dept& comes into existence.
F06 0290 All sorts of plans come to life. This is followed by a boom in conferences.
F06 0300 Yes sir! Conferences become very popular. When a plan
F06 0310 burst its seams, hasty conferences supply the necessary patch, and life
F06 0320 goes merrily on. That's called progress! The new way of life!
F06 0330 Let's face it! You had your day and it was a good day. Let this
F06 0340 generation have theirs. Time marches on!   Well, to get back
F06 0350 to the problem of retirement. Every retiring person has a different
F06 0360 situation facing him. Some have plenty of money- some have very little
F06 0370 money. Some are blest with an abundance of good health- some
F06 0380 are in poor health and many are invalids. Some have lovely homes-
F06 0390 some live in small apartments. Some have beautiful gardens- some not
F06 0400 even a blade of grass. Some have serenity of mind, the ability to accept
F06 0410 what they have, and make the most of it (a wonderful gift to have,
F06 0420 believe me)- some see only darkness, the bitter side of everything.
F06 0430 Well, whatever you have, that's it! You've got to learn to
F06 0440 live with it.   Now! The question is "How are you going to
F06 0450 live with it"? ## {You can sit back and moan and bewail your
F06 0460 lot.} Yes! You can do this. But, if you do, your life will
F06 0470 be just one thing- unhappiness- complete and unabridged.   It
F06 0480 seems to me, the first thing you've got to do, to be happy, is to
F06 0490 face up to your problems, no matter what they may be. Make up your mind
F06 0500 to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years
F06 0510 of life. One thing, I am sure of, you must get an interest in life.
F06 0520 You've got to do something.   Many of you will say, "Well,
F06 0530 what can I do"?   Believe me! There are many, many things
F06 0540 to do. Find out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl.
F06 0550 If you can't think of a thing to do, try something- anything.
F06 0560 Maybe you will surprise yourself.   True! We are not all great
F06 0570 artists. I, frankly, can't draw a straight line. Maybe you are
F06 0580 not that gifted either, but how about puttering around with the old paints?
F06 0590 You may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it. Anyway,
F06 0600 I'll bet you have a lot of fun.   Do you like to sew? Does
F06 0610 making your own clothes or even doll clothes, interest you? Do
F06 0620 you love to run up a hem, sew on buttons, make neat buttonholes? If
F06 0630 you do, go to it. There is always a market for this line of work. Some
F06 0640 women can sit and sew, crochet, tat or knit by the hour, and look
F06 0650 calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work. Where sewing is concerned,
F06 0660 I'm a total loss. When you see a needle in my hands you will
F06 0670 know the family buttons have fallen off and I have to sew them back on,
F06 0680 or get out the safety pins.   Then again, there's always that
F06 0690 lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs. Not for me, but perhaps
F06 0700 just the thing for you.   {Well! How's about mosaic
F06 0710 tile, ceramics or similar arts and crafts?} Some people love to
F06 0720 crack tile and it's amazing what beautiful designs they come up with
F06 0730 as a result of their cracking good time.   How about the art of
F06 0740 cooking? Do you yearn to make cakes and pies, or special cookies
F06 0750 and candies? There is always an open market for this sort of delicacy,
F06 0760 in spite of low calorie diets, cottage cheese and hands-off-all-sweets
F06 0770 to the contrary.   Some people can carve most anything out
F06 0780 of a piece of wood. Some make beautiful chairs, cabinets, chests, doll
F06 0790 houses, etc&.
F06 0800 Perhaps you couldn't do that but have you ever tried
F06 0810 to see what you could do with a hunk of wood? Outside of cutting your
F06 0820 fingers, maybe you would come up with nothing at all, but then again,
F06 0830 you might turn out some dandy little gadgets.   Some women get
F06 0840 a real thrill out of housework. They love to dust, scrub, polish,
F06 0850 wax floors, move the furniture around from place to place, take down the
F06 0860 curtains, put up new ones and have themselves a real ball. Maybe that's
F06 0870 your forte. It certainly isn't mine. I can look at furniture
F06 0880 in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that's
F06 0890 where it belongs. ## {Perhaps you would like to become a writer.}
F06 0900 This gives you a wide and varied choice. Will it be short stories,
F06 0910 fiction, nonfiction, biography, poetry, children's stories, or even
F06 0920 a book if you are really ambitious?   Ever since I was a
F06 0930 child, I have always had a yen to try my hand at writing. If you do
F06 0940 decide to write, you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips
F06 0950 and dejection. Don't be discouraged! This is just being a normal
F06 0960 writer. Just let the rejection slips fall where they may, and keep
F06 0970 on plugging, and finally you will make the grade. Few new writers have
F06 0980 their first story accepted, so they tell me. But, it could happen,
F06 0990 and it may happen to you.   Then there's always hobbies, collecting
F06 1000 stamps, coins, timetables, salt and pepper shakers, elephants,
F06 1010 dogs, dolls, shells, or shall we just say collecting anything your heart
F06 1020 desires?   I can hear some of you folks protesting. You say,
F06 1030 "But it costs a lot of money to have a hobby. I haven't got that
F06 1040 kind of money".   True! It does cost a lot of money for
F06 1050 most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free. How about a rock
F06 1060 collection, or a collection of leaves from different trees or shrubs
F06 1070 and in different colors? Then, take flowers. They are many and varied.
F06 1080 Also, there's scrap books, collecting newspaper pictures and
F06 1090 clippings, or any items of interest to you. It's getting interested
F06 1100 in something that counts. ## {As for me, I am holding in reserve
F06 1110 two huge puzzles (I love puzzles)} to put together when time hangs
F06 1120 heavy on my hands. So far, the covers have never been off the
F06 1130 boxes. I just don't have time to do half the things I want to do now.
F06 1140    So in closing, fellow retired members, I advise you to make
F06 1150 the most of each day, enjoy each one to the ~n'th degree. Travel,
F06 1160 if you can. Keep occupied to the point you are not bored with life
F06 1170 and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to
F06 1180 be sunshine sweet.   Good Luck! To one and all- Good Days
F06 1190 ahead!
F06 1200 {A}n important criterion of maturity is creativity. The mature
F06 1205 person
F06 1210 is creative. What does it mean to be creative, a term we hear with increasing
F06 1220 frequency these days? When we turn to Noah Webster we find
F06 1230 him helpful as usual. "To be creative is to have the ability to
F06 1240 cause to exist- to produce where nothing was before- to bring forth
F06 1250 an original production of human intelligence or power". We are creative,
F06 1260 it seems, when we produce something which has not previously existed.
F06 1270 Thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake, building
F06 1280 a chicken coop, or producing a book, to founding a business, creating
F06 1290 a League of Nations or, developing a mature character.   All
F06 1300 living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence
F06 1310 the power of creativity, if it is only to reproduce a form like their
F06 1320 own. While man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors
F06 1330 in the evolutionary process, he is the only animal with a true
F06 1340 non-instinctive and conscious creative ability. An animal, bird or
F06 1350 insect creates either a burrow, or nest or hive in unending sameness
F06 1360 according to specie. Man's great superiority over these evolutionary
F06 1370 forbears is in the development of his imagination. This gives him the
F06 1380 power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories, ideas
F06 1390 and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment
F06 1400 in new and ever-changing forms. ## {I}t has been
F06 1405 truly said
F06 1410 that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting
F06 1420 this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world. In our
F06 1430 own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a Jules Verne
F06 1440 come into actuality. The vision of a Lord Tennyson expressed in a
F06 1450 poem 100 years ago took visible form over London in the air blitzes of
F06 1460 1941. In fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man's
F06 1470 projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more. It
F06 1480 is in this one aspect, at least, that man seems to be made in the image
F06 1490 of his Creator.   Not only can man project his imagination
F06 1500 out into his environment in concrete forms, but even more importantly,
F06 1510 he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself.
F06 1520 We recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training
F06 1530 can become athletes, acrobats, dancers, musicians and artists, developing
F06 1540 many potentialities. We know that actors can learn to portray
F06 1550 a wide variety of character roles. By this same combination of the
F06 1560 will and the imagination, each one of us can learn to portray permanently
F06 1570 the kind of character we would like to be. We must realize with
F06 1580 Prof& Charles Morris in his THE OPEN SELF that "Man is the
F06 1590 being that can continually remake himself, the artisan that is himself
F06 1600 the material for his own creation". ## {S}o far in
F06 1605 history man
F06 1610 has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment
F06 1620 rather than first creating the sort of person who can make
F06 1630 the highest use of the things he has created. Is not the present world
F06 1640 crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us
F06 1650 and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall
F06 1660 the tragedy. Is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend
F06 1670 our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our
F06 1680 own maturing process?   Sir Julian Huxley in his book UNIQUENESS
F06 1690 OF MAN makes the novel point that just as man is unique in
F06 1700 being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood
F06 1710 under family protection, so is he the only animal who has a long
F06 1720 period after the decline of his procreativity.
F07 0010    SOME recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples
F07 0020 are a thing of the remote, Victorian past; that nowadays all honeymooners
F07 0030 are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough
F07 0040 from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all
F07 0050 the anxiety and hazards out of the situation.   Perhaps- but extensive
F07 0060 discussions with contemporary practitioners, family doctors and
F07 0070 gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance.
F07 0080 Joking and talking may be freer and easier, but the important factual
F07 0090 information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men
F07 0100 and women.   Various factors in the setting can still be of great
F07 0110 advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad
F07 0120 memory for one or both. Privacy must be highly assured both in time and
F07 0130 place. That is, locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of
F07 0140 location, but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough
F07 0150 for an utterly unhurried fulfillment.   If the wedding party lasted
F07 0160 late, and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before
F07 0170 resuming the trip or making an early start, the husband may forestall
F07 0180 tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying
F07 0190 in each other's arms will be bliss enough for these few hours. The
F07 0200 consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long
F07 0210 private time (day or night) for that purpose. ## First intercourse
F07 0220 for the bride brings with it the various problems connected
F07 0230 with virginity and the hymen.   <One thing should be clear to
F07 0240 both husband and wife- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur
F07 0250 when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act. Ignorance on this
F07 0260 point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety, misunderstanding
F07 0270 and suspicion>.   The hymen is, in essence, a fragile membrane
F07 0280 that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most
F07 0290 female human beings who have not had sex relations. (Hymen, in fact,
F07 0300 is the Greek word for membrane.)   Often it is thin and fragile
F07 0310 and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse.
F07 0320 As might be expected, girls in this situation bleed very little
F07 0330 and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity.
F07 0340    It is also important to realize that many girls are born without
F07 0350 a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one; so that <the absence
F07 0360 of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex
F07 0370 relations>.   But there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations
F07 0380 of the folk-lore beliefs. Some hymens are so strongly developed that
F07 0390 they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked
F07 0400 loss of blood. More rarely, the hymen is so sturdy that it does not
F07 0410 yield to penetration.   Extreme cases are on record in which the
F07 0420 doctor
F07 0430 has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital
F07 0440 relations to be consummated. These cases, for all their rarity, are
F07 0450 so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general
F07 0460 population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen
F07 0470 is a serious problem to newly-weds.
F07 0475 ## In recent times, when sexual
F07 0480 matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly,
F07 0490 the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention.
F07 0500 Obviously, the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new
F07 0510 situation. Is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of
F07 0520 making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride?
F07 0530    <Gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride
F07 0540 should consult a physician before marriage. If he foresaw any problem
F07 0550 because of the quality of the hymen, it was recommended that simple
F07 0560 procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or, preferably,
F07 0570 to dilate it>.   As a natural outgrowth of this approach it was
F07 0580 often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for
F07 0590 painless intercourse by dilating the vagina.   This recommendation
F07 0600 was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth
F07 0610 consummation of the sex act. The vagina is an organ capable of
F07 0620 remarkable contraction and dilation. This is obvious when it is remembered
F07 0630 that, during childbirth, the vagina must dilate enough to permit
F07 0640 the passage of the baby.   The intricate system of muscles that
F07 0650 manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under
F07 0660 voluntary control. But an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious
F07 0670 intention of the woman. That is, when first penetration takes
F07 0680 place, the pressure and pain signals may <involuntarily> cause all the
F07 0690 vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent
F07 0700 further pain. ## The advantages
F07 0705 of dilatation by the physician
F07 0710 are both physical and psychological. Since it is a purely professional
F07 0720 situation, none of the pain is associated with love-making or the
F07 0730 beloved. By using instruments of gradually increasing size, the vagina
F07 0740 is gently, and with minimum pain at each stage, taught to yield to
F07 0750 an object of the appropriate shape.   In this process the vaginal
F07 0760 muscles come under better conscious control by the girl. She learns
F07 0770 how to relax them to <accept>- instead of contracting them to <repel>
F07 0780 the entering object.   Apart from the standard problem of
F07 0790 controlling the vaginal muscles, other serious barriers may exist that
F07 0800 need special gynecological treatment. It is far better to have such
F07 0810 conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon
F07 0820 where they can create a really serious situation.   When no
F07 0830 medical problems exist, the newly married couple generally prefer to
F07 0840 cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves. Special
F07 0850 information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still
F07 0860 of great value. Folk-lore, superstition and remembered passages from
F07 0870 erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly
F07 0880 taken as scientific facts and useful hints. ## <The importance
F07 0890 of loving tenderness is obvious. The long, unhurried approach and
F07 0900 the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels. Under
F07 0910 the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes
F07 0920 and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases, providing an excellent
F07 0930 lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration>.   Extensive
F07 0940 observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established
F07 0950 the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall
F07 0960 (the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back) may cause
F07 0970 a great deal of distress in a virgin. <But> during the same examination,
F07 0980 <two> fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall (the
F07 0990 bottom of the vagina in the same position) without any pain; and in
F07 1000 fact without any difficulty <if the pressure is kept downward at all
F07 1010 times>.   These regional differences of sensitivity to pain may
F07 1020 be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse. The husband
F07 1030 and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in
F07 1040 mind. They may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too
F07 1050 much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina; at
F07 1060 least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer
F07 1070 a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making.   In
F07 1080 fact, the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely
F07 1090 adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon.
F07 1100    Locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing
F07 1110 the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration.
F07 1120 The false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain
F07 1130 while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased
F07 1140 with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling
F07 1150 the problem once and for all.   <Such talk is seriously in error.
F07 1160 Ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride,
F07 1170 both physically and psychologically. The insistent, forceful penetration
F07 1180 may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage
F07 1190 to the hymen>.   <The pain and distress associated with
F07 1200 the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital
F07 1210 relations and cause her, unconsciously, to make the sex act unpleasant
F07 1220 and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate
F07 1230 his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it>. ##
F07 1240 Serious attention must also be given to the husband's problems in
F07 1250 the honeymoon situation. The necessity for keeping alert to his bride's
F07 1260 hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous
F07 1270 desire. The emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience
F07 1280 a premature climax. This is a very common experience and should in
F07 1290 no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife.   Or the
F07 1300 frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of
F07 1310 the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him
F07 1320 to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period. The signals
F07 1330 to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to
F07 1340 take advantage of them.   The best course is to recover his physical
F07 1350 excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again. This
F07 1360 may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding
F07 1370 and self-centered. He can take security from the fact that the
F07 1380 progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost.
F07 1390 Now while he uses talk, caresses or requires caresses from her, his bride
F07 1400 will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him
F07 1410 restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they
F07 1420 both so eagerly desire.   A final word. The accumulated information
F07 1430 on this point shows that first intercourse, even when it is achieved
F07 1440 with minimum pain or difficulty, is seldom an overwhelming sexual
F07 1450 experience to a woman. Too many new things are happening for it to
F07 1460 be a complete erotic fulfillment.   Only under rare circumstances
F07 1470 would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse. Both
F07 1480 man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax, and
F07 1490 even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that
F07 1500 the wife may be cold or frigid.   If the early approaches are wise,
F07 1510 understanding and patient, the satisfactions of marital fulfillment
F07 1520 will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older.
F07 1530    WRITING in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures,
F07 1540 titled <The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form,> Kenneth
F07 1550 Clark declares: "**h The human body, as a nucleus, is rich in associations.
F07 1560 **h It is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things
F07 1565 we wish to do with ourselves".   Perhaps this is a clue to
F07 1570 the amazing variety and power of reactions, attitudes, and emotions precipitated
F07 1575 by the nude form.   The wide divergence of reactions
F07 1580 is clearly illustrated in the Kinsey studies in human sexuality.
F07 1590 Differences were related to social, economic, and educational backgrounds.
F07 1600 Whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt
F07 1610 to avoid or be shocked by nudity, those educated beyond the eighth
F07 1620 grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations.
F07 1630    Such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating
F07 1640 thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that
F07 1650 her husband had "never seen her entirely naked", while another woman,
F07 1660 boasting an equal number of years of married life, is proud of having
F07 1670 "shared the nudist way of life- the really free, natural nude
F07 1680 life- for most of that period".   Attempts at censorship always
F07 1690 involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions.
F07 1695 The indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude
F07 1700 human form as "lewd
F07 1710 and pornographic, a threat and danger" to all the young, or good,
F07 1720 or religious, or moral persons.   The equally ardent proponent
F07 1730 of
F07 1740 freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the
F07 1750 "natural, honest, free expression of man's spirit and the epitome
F07 1760 of beauty and inspiration".   One is always a little surprised
F07 1770 to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected. I
F07 1780 still recall the mild shock I experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic
F07 1790 advocate of the "clean, healthful, free way of natural life
F07 1800 in nudism", who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution
F07 1810 in fine spirit.
F08 0010    @ IN TRADITION and in poetry, the marriage bed is a place
F08 0020 of unity and harmony. The partners each bring to it unselfish love,
F08 0030 and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy.   At its
F08 0040 most ecstatic moments, husband and wife are elevated far above worldly
F08 0050 cares. Everything else is closed away.   This is the ideal.
F08 0060 But marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy
F08 0070 are seldom achieved. Instead one partner or the other dominates the
F08 0080 sexual relationship. In the past, it has been the husband who has been
F08 0090 dominant and the wife passive. But today there are signs that these
F08 0100 roles are being reversed.   In a growing number of American homes,
F08 0110 marriage counselors report, the wife is taking a commanding role
F08 0120 in sexual relationships. It is she who decides the time, the place,
F08 0130 the surroundings, and the frequency of the sexual act. It is she who
F08 0140 says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics-
F08 0150 not the husband. The whole act is tailored to <her> pleasure,
F08 0160 and not to <theirs>.   Beyond a certain point, of course,
F08 0170 no woman can be dominant- nature has seen to that. But there is little
F08 0180 doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed.
F08 0190    Of course, there remain many "old-fashioned" marriages in
F08 0200 which the husband maintains his supremacy. Yet even in these marriages,
F08 0210 psychologists say, wives are asserting themselves more strongly. The
F08 0220 meekest, most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother's
F08 0230 or grandmother's standards.   To many experts, this trend was
F08 0240 inevitable. They consider it simply a sign of our times. Our society
F08 0250 has "emancipated" the woman, giving her new independence and new
F08 0260 authority. It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual
F08 0270 role.   "The sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum",
F08 0280 declares Dr& Mary Steichen Calderone, medical director of the
F08 0290 Planned Parenthood Federation of America and author of the recent
F08 0300 book, <Release From Sexual Tensions>. "It reflects what is going
F08 0310 on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself. A world
F08 0320 in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual
F08 0330 relationships in which wives are more self-assertive, too".
F08 0340    Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination
F08 0350 of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy
F08 0360 and even dangerous. It can, in fact, wreck a marriage.   When
F08 0370 a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife's desires, she
F08 0380 is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her.
F08 0390 And she begins to regard him as savage, bestial and unworthy.
F08 0400 On the other hand, wifely supremacy demeans the husband, saps his self-respect,
F08 0410 and robs him of his masculinity. He is a target of ridicule
F08 0420 to his wife, and often- since private affairs rarely remain private-
F08 0430 to the outside world as well.   "A marriage can survive almost
F08 0440 any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's
F08 0450 maleness", declares Dr& Calderone. This opinion is supported
F08 0460 by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists, Dr& Maurice
F08 0470 E& Linden, director of the Mental Health Division of the Philadelphia
F08 0480 Department of Public Health.   "When the roles of
F08 0490 husband and wife are reversed, so that the wife becomes leader and the
F08 0500 husband follower", Dr& Linden says, "the effects on their whole
F08 0510 relationship, sexual and otherwise, can be disastrous". ##
F08 0520 IN ONE EXTREME case, cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist, an office
F08 0530 worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband
F08 0540 unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded. To win her favors, her
F08 0550 husband first took an additional job, then desperately began to embezzle
F08 0560 from his employer. Caught at last, he was sentenced to prison. While
F08 0570 he was in custody his wife divorced him.   More typical is
F08 0580 the case of a suburban Long Island housewife described by a marriage
F08 0590 counselor. This woman repeatedly complained she was "too tired"
F08 0600 for marital relations. To please her, her husband assumed some of the
F08 0610 domestic chores. Finally, he was cooking, washing dishes, bathing the
F08 0620 children, and even ironing- and still his wife refused to have relations
F08 0630 as often as he desired them.   One wife, described by a
F08 0640 New York psychologist, so dominated her husband that she actually placed
F08 0650 their sexual relationship on a schedule, writing it down right between
F08 0660 the weekly ~PTA meetings and the Thursday-night neighborhood
F08 0670 card parties. Another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis. After
F08 0680 every money argument, she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the
F08 0690 matter was settled in her favor.   Experts say the partners in
F08 0700 marriages like these can almost be typed.   The wife is likely
F08 0710 to be young, sophisticated, smart as a whip- often a girl who has sacrificed
F08 0720 a promising career for marriage. She knows the power of the
F08 0730 sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband.   The husband
F08 0740 is usually a well-educated professional, preoccupied with his job-
F08 0750 often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is: "Don't
F08 0760 rock the boat".   Sometimes this leads to his becoming
F08 0770 demandingly dominant in marriage. Hemmed in on the job and unable to
F08 0780 assert himself, he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one
F08 0790 area.   More often, though, he is so accustomed to submitting
F08 0800 to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule
F08 0810 at home.   Some psychologists, in fact, suggest that career-bound
F08 0820 husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their
F08 0830 wives. The wife's attempt at control, these psychologists contend,
F08 0840 is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay
F08 0850 as much attention to her as he does to his job.   Naturally no
F08 0860 woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative. Unless her
F08 0870 husband also desires sex, the act cannot be consummated. Generally,
F08 0880 however, in such marriages as those cited, the husband is at his wife's
F08 0890 mercy.   "The pattern", says Dr& Morton
F08 0895 Schillinger,
F08 0900 psychologist at New York's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy,
F08 0910 "is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly, virtually
F08 0920 trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight
F08 0930 is the night".   No one seriously contends, of course, that
F08 0940 the domineering wife is, sexually speaking, a new character in our world.
F08 0950 After all, the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic
F08 0960 figure of long standing, in literature and on the stage, as Dr& Schillinger
F08 0970 points out. There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts
F08 0980 became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master
F08 0990 bedroom. ## FURTHERMORE, Dr& Calderone says, a certain
F08 1000 number of docile, retiring men always have been around. They aren't
F08 1010 "frigid" and they aren't homosexual; they're just restrained
F08 1020 in all of life. They <like> to be dominated. One such man once
F08 1030 confided to Dr& Theodor Reik, New York psychiatrist, that he
F08 1040 preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor. Asked why, he replied
F08 1050 primly: "Because that's no activity for a gentleman".
F08 1060    But such cases were, in the past, unusual. Society here and abroad
F08 1070 has been built around the dominating male- even the Bible appears
F08 1080 to endorse the concept.   Family survival on our own Western frontier,
F08 1090 for example, could quite literally depend on a man's strength
F08 1100 and ability to bring home the bacon; and the dependent wife seldom
F08 1110 questioned his judgment about anything, including the marriage bed.
F08 1120    This carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early
F08 1130 20th centuries, when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring
F08 1140 <Life With Father> manner.   In those days, a wife had mighty
F08 1150 few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere.
F08 1160 "Grandma wasn't expected to like it", Dr& Marion Hilliard,
F08 1170 the late Toronto gynecologist, once summed up the attitude of the
F08 1180 '90s. Wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as
F08 1190 "used" by their husbands- and, history indicates, they often quite
F08 1200 literally were.   When was the turning point? When did women
F08 1210 begin to assert themselves sexually? ## SOME DATE IT from
F08 1220 woman suffrage, others from when women first began to challenge men
F08 1230 in the marketplace, still others from the era of the emancipated flapper
F08 1240 and bathtub gin. Virtually everyone agrees, however, that the trend
F08 1250 toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with
F08 1260 the postwar rush to the suburbs.   Left alone while her husband
F08 1270 was miles away in the city, the modern wife assumed more and more duties
F08 1280 normally reserved for the male. Circumstances gave her almost undisputed
F08 1290 sway over child-rearing, money-handling and home maintenance.
F08 1300 She found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was
F08 1310 once considered too helpless. She liked this taste of authority and
F08 1320 independence, and, with darkness, was not likely to give it up.
F08 1330    "Very few wives", says Dr& Calderone, "who balance the checkbook,
F08 1340 fix the car, choose where the family will live and deal with
F08 1350 the tradesmen, are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned.
F08 1360 A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the
F08 1370 sexual relationship as well".   And an additional factor was
F08 1380 helping to make women more sexually self-assertive- the comparatively
F08 1390 recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response.
F08 1400 Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the
F08 1410 importance of the female climax. They began to describe in detail the
F08 1420 woman's capacity for response.   In fact, the noted psychologist
F08 1430 and sex researcher, Dr& Albert Ellis, has declared flatly that
F08 1440 women are "sexually superior" to men. According to Dr& Ellis,
F08 1450 the average 20-year-old American woman is capable of far greater sexual
F08 1460 arousal than her partner. Not surprisingly, Dr& Ellis says,
F08 1470 some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities.
F08 1480    Yet, paradoxically, according to Dr& Maurice Linden, many
F08 1490 wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them. An aggressive
F08 1500 woman wants a man to demand, not knuckle under. "When the husband
F08 1510 becomes passive in the face of his wife's aggressiveness", Dr&
F08 1520 Linden says, "the wife, in turn, finds him inadequate. Often she
F08 1530 fails to gain sexual satisfaction".   One such wife, Dr&
F08 1540 Linden says, became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through
F08 1550 a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger
F08 1560 man. But her personality was such that each affair lasted only until
F08 1570 that lover, too, had been conquered and reduced to passivity. Then the
F08 1580 wife bed-hopped to the next on the list.   In some cases, however,
F08 1590 domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary, triggered
F08 1600 by a passing but urgent emotional need. Thus a man who is butting
F08 1610 a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed-
F08 1620 the one place he can still be champion. If his on-the-job problems work
F08 1630 out, he may return to his old pattern. Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness
F08 1640 will sweep over a man- or his wife- because he or she feels
F08 1650 age creeping up.   On the other hand, a husband who always has
F08 1660 been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive- asking,
F08 1670 psychologists say, for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable.
F08 1680 Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted, flattered
F08 1690 or coaxed, simply because she needs her ego lifted.   In any case,
F08 1700 Dr& Calderone remarks, such problems are a couple's own affair,
F08 1710 and can't always be measured by a general yardstick. "As long
F08 1720 as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex, it makes little
F08 1730 difference if one or the other dominates", Dr& Calderone declares.
F08 1740 "The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment".
F08 1750    Other experts say, however, that if sexual domination
F08 1760 by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period,
F08 1770 it is likely to shake the marriage. And just as domination today often
F08 1780 begins with the wife, so the cure generally must lie with the husband.
F08 1790    "To get a marriage back where it belongs", comments Dr&
F08 1800 Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute, "the husband must take
F08 1810 some very basic steps. He must begin, paradoxically, by becoming more
F08 1820 selfish. He must become more expressive of his own desires, more demanding
F08 1830 and less 'understanding'".   Too many husbands, Dr&
F08 1840 Schillinger continues, worry about "how well they're doing",
F08 1850 and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual
F08 1860 play.
F09 0010 ## SHE GAVE HERSELF a title **h Lady Diana Harrington.
F09 0020    The New York D&A& gave her another **h the Golden Girl
F09 0030 of cafe society.   Houston police gave her a third, less flamboyant,
F09 0040 title **h prostitute.   And Houston police have the final
F09 0050 say in the matter since she died there on September 20, 1960, "Diane
F09 0060 Harris Graham, 30, D&O&A& circumstances- unusual".
F09 0070    Early in her life she had discovered that where there were men,
F09 0080 there was money, and with the two came luxury and liquor. She was still
F09 0090 in the play for pay business when she died, a top trollop who had
F09 0100 given the world's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour.
F09 0110    She never hid the fact that she liked to play. Her neighbors
F09 0120 in the expensive Houston apartment building told reporters that
F09 0130 the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as
F09 0140 "the Golden
F09 0150 Girl of the Mickey Jelke trial".   It was the trial of
F09 0160 oleomargarine heir Minot (Mickey) Jelke for compulsory prostitution
F09 0170 in New York that put the spotlight on the international play-girl.
F09 0180 (Jelke later served 21 months when he was found guilty of masterminding
F09 0190 a ring of high-priced call girls.)   Diane was needed as a material
F09 0200 witness in the case and New York police searched three continents
F09 0210 before they found her in their own back yard- in a swank hotel,
F09 0220 of course. She had been moving in cafe society as Lady Diana Harrington,
F09 0230 a name that made some of the gossip columns.   It was when
F09 0240 she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation
F09 0250 she liked best.   Clad in mink and diamonds, she listened to Assistant
F09 0260 District Attorney Anthony Liebler describe her to the arraigning
F09 0270 judge:   "This girl is the Golden Girl of cafe society.
F09 0280    "In 1951 she was a prostitute in New York County. In
F09 0290 the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign
F09 0300 tycoon who took her to France, where she later met a very wealthy man
F09 0310 and toured all Europe with him.   "At Deauville she met an
F09 0320 Egyptian by the name of Pulley Bey. He was the official procurer for
F09 0330 King Farouk, now in exile. She was in Egypt during the revolution
F09 0340 and had passport difficulty. She lied in order to get it.   "We
F09 0350 have checked her in different parts of Europe and Egypt and finally
F09 0360 back into this country **h She has been acting as a prostitute.
F09 0370    "Our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts
F09 0380 to Jelke".   Diane sobbingly denied this to the court.
F09 0390 "That's a lie. I never gave that boy a cent. I am not a prostitute,
F09 0400 and I had only one very wealthy boy friend", she said.
F09 0410 During the course of the trial, Jelke backed up part of that statement.
F09 0420    "Diane is the type of girl", Jelke said, "who wouldn't
F09 0430 get loving- even on her wedding night- unless you piled up
F09 0440 all your money in the middle of the floor".   But she seemed to
F09 0450 have underestimated the number of her "boy friends".   She
F09 0460 came to New York from Detroit as a teenager, but with a "sponsor"
F09 0470 instead of a chaperone. As she told it, "He's a rich boy friend,
F09 0480 an old guy about 60". She was Mary Lou Brew then, wide-eyed,
F09 0490 but not naive. She had talked her "boy friend" into sending her
F09 0500 to New York to take a screen test.
F09 0510    The screen test was never made- but Diane was. She quickly
F09 0520 moved into cafe society, possibly easing her conscience by talking
F09 0530 constantly of her desire to be in show business.   She seemed
F09 0540 so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail
F09 0550 circuit set up a practical joke.   An ex-fighter was introduced
F09 0560 to her in a bar as "Mr& Warfield, the famous producer". The
F09 0570 phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows.
F09 0580    "I'd love to audition for you", she gushed.   The
F09 0590 audition was held a few minutes later in somebody's apartment. She
F09 0600 thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show
F09 0610 the eminent producer how well she could dance.   After a few minutes
F09 0620 he said, "I can't use you if you dance like that. I'd like
F09 0630 to see you dance nude".   She hastily complied. Diane loved
F09 0640 to dance in the nude, something she was to demonstrate time and again.
F09 0650    She developed another quaint habit. Even among the fast set
F09 0660 in which she was moving, her method for keeping an escort from departing
F09 0670 too early was unique.   When the date would try to bid her
F09 0680 good-night at the door, she would tell him, "If you go home now, I'll
F09 0690 scream". More often than not he would bow to the inevitable.
F09 0700    One who needed no such threats was a French financier. One of
F09 0710 the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was for travel. She wanted
F09 0720 to go around the world, but she settled for a French holiday.
F09 0730    In an anonymous interview with a French newspaper the financier told
F09 0740 of spending several months with her. "Then she went to Deauville
F09 0750 where she met a member of a powerful Greek syndicate of gamblers".
F09 0760    The Greek evidently fell for her, "Monsieur ~X" recounted,
F09 0770 and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he
F09 0780 gave her 100,000 francs (about $300) and led her to the roulette tables.
F09 0790    She could do no wrong at the tables that time. And in short
F09 0800 order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way. Smarter
F09 0810 than most gamblers, she slipped away from the casino, packed her bag
F09 0820 and took the night train to Paris. No one ever learned what happened
F09 0830 to the Greek.   The luxury of Paris' most fashionable hotel,
F09 0840 the George /5,, bored the beautifully-built blonde, so she high-tailed
F09 0850 it to Rome.   She teamed up with another beauty, whose
F09 0860 name has been lost to history, and commenced with some fiddling that
F09 0870 would have made Nero envious.   To climax her Roman revels, she
F09 0880 was thrown out of the swanky Hotel Excelsior after she had run naked
F09 0890 through its marble halls screaming for help.   It was a rugged
F09 0900 finish for what must have been a very interesting night.   Discreet
F09 0910 Italian police described it in a manner typically continental.
F09 0920    "There had been a threesome at the party in the suite's bedroom:
F09 0930 Miss Harrington (this was Diane's choice for a Roman name),
F09 0940 another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and
F09 0950 one of your well-known American actors.   "The actor had had
F09 0960 much to drink and apparently became very violent. The hotel staff,
F09 0970 as well as residents of the Excelsior, told us they saw that both ladies
F09 0980 were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall.
F09 0990    "They were wearing nothing but their scratches. They were
F09 1000 asked to leave the hotel. No charges were filed".   The girls,
F09 1010 after dressing, were indignant.   "You can't do this to
F09 1020 us", Diane screamed. "We are Americans".   In the morning
F09 1030 she found rooms directly across from the Excelsior at the equally
F09 1040 luxurious Hotel Ambassador.   With the Ambassador as headquarters,
F09 1050 she continued to promote good will abroad. Of course, her benevolence
F09 1060 was limited to those who could afford it, but then there is a
F09 1070 limit to what one person can do.   By this time Diane was a beguiling
F09 1080 lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world. She thought
F09 1090 royal status might come her way when, while she was still in Rome,
F09 1100 she met Pulley Bey, a personal procurer to King Farouk of Egypt.
F09 1110    A close friend of hers in the Roman days described it this
F09 1120 way:   "It was a strange relationship. Pulley Bey spoke no
F09 1130 English. Diane spoke no Italian or French. She had a hard time
F09 1140 making him understand that it was Farouk she wished to meet.   "Pulley
F09 1150 Bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him", the friend
F09 1160 continued. It seemed as though she were always auditioning.
F09 1170 No believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors, the plump
F09 1180 Pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to Cairo where she
F09 1190 waited for nine months, vainly hoping to see Farouk.   Pulley
F09 1200 had set her up at the Semiramis Hotel, but she grew impatient waiting
F09 1210 for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the
F09 1220 royal pimp had no key.   She picked her own Middle-Eastern friends
F09 1230 from the flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her. Tewfik
F09 1240 Badrawi, Mohammed Gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of
F09 1250 Cairo society enjoyed her company.   "So extensive became her
F09 1260 circle of admirers", Egyptian police said, "that her escapades
F09 1270 caused distrust".   The roof was about ready to fall in on Diane's
F09 1280 little world, but it took nothing less than the Egyptian revolution
F09 1290 to bring it down. When Farouk was overthrown, police picked up
F09 1300 his personal pimp, Pulley Bey. They also called upon Diane with
F09 1310 a request for a look at her passport.   The cagey Pulley Bey,
F09 1320 who spoke no English, had taken the passport so that Diane
F09 1325 couldn't
F09 1330 leave the country without his approval. Officials provided a temporary
F09 1340 passport, good only for return to the United States.   And
F09 1350 return to the United States she did, into waiting arms- the unromantic
F09 1360 ones of the New York District Attorney's office.   Held
F09 1370 as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of Mickey
F09 1380 Jelke, the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed
F09 1390 to the Women's House of Detention, a terribly overcrowded prison.
F09 1400    It is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk
F09 1410 the District Attorney into having her removed from the prison to a
F09 1420 hotel room, with her meals taken at Vesuvio's, an excellent Italian
F09 1430 restaurant.   Newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated
F09 1440 that she was co-operating with the District Attorney.   With
F09 1450 the end of the trial Diane disappeared from New York **h it was
F09 1460 no longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous "Lady Harrington".
F09 1470    Several years ago she married a Houston business man, Robert
F09 1480 Graham. She later divorced Graham, who is believed to have moved
F09 1490 to Bolivia.   Houston police got to know Diane two years ago
F09 1500 when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring.
F09 1510 Last May, they said, she admitted being a prostitute.   The
F09 1520 next time the police saw her she was dead.   It was September
F09 1530 20, 1960, in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles.
F09 1540 She had had a party with a regular visitor, Dr& William W&
F09 1550 McClellan.   McClellan, who had once lost his medical license
F09 1560 temporarily on a charge of drug addiction, was with her when she died.
F09 1570 He had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had
F09 1580 happened during that time. When he realized she was dead, he called
F09 1590 two lawyers and then the police.   When the police arrived, they
F09 1600 found McClellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently.
F09 1610    The blonde's nude body was in bed, a green sheet and a pink
F09 1620 blanket covered her. Pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the
F09 1630 walls.   An autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in Diane's
F09 1640 body. Police theorize that a combination of dope, drink and
F09 1650 drugs killed her.   "I think that maybe she wanted it this way",
F09 1660 a vice squad cop said. "A maid told us that she still bragged
F09 1670 about getting $50 a date. She was on the junk, and they slide fast when
F09 1680 that happens. At least she never knew what the bottom was
F09 1690 like".
F09 1700 I AM a carpet salesman.   I work for one of the biggest chains
F09 1710 of retail carpet houses in the East. We cater mostly to nice people
F09 1720 in the $5-8,000 annual income bracket and we run a string of snazzy,
F09 1730 neon-lit, chromium-plated suburban stores.   I am selling the
F09 1740 stuff of which is made one of the Great American Dreams- <wall-to-wall
F09 1750 carpeting>.   There is only one trouble with this big,
F09 1760 beautiful dream. From where I sit it looks more like a nightmare.
F09 1770    People come to me with confidence. They depend on my supposedly
F09 1780 expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little.
F09 1790    But I knowingly abuse their confidence.
F10 0010 FRANKLIN D& Lee proved a man of prompt action when Mrs&
F10 0020 Claire Shaefer, accompanied by a friend, visited him in Bakersfield,
F10 0030 California, several months ago as a prospective patient. "Doctor"
F10 0040 Lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes. Then,
F10 0050 by squeezing her foot three times, he came up- presto- with a
F10 0060 different diagnosis with each squeeze. She had- he informed her-
F10 0070 kidney trouble, liver trouble, and a severe female disorder. (He explained
F10 0080 that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because
F10 0090 all of the nervous system was connected to it.) He knew just the
F10 0100 thing for her- a treatment from his "cosmic light ozone generator"
F10 0110 machine.   As he applied the applicator extending from the
F10 0120 machine- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed
F10 0130 on a rectangular base- to the supposedly diseased portions
F10 0140 of Mrs& Shaefer's body, Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific
F10 0150 mumbo-jumbo. Yes, the ozone from his machine would cure practically
F10 0160 everything, he assured her. Did she know, he asked, why the
F10 0170 colors of the tubes were important to people's health? The human
F10 0180 body- he pointed out, for example- required 33 units of blue light.
F10 0190 For that reason, he informed her, the Lord made the sky blue. Continuing
F10 0200 glibly in this vein, he paused to comfort her:   "Don't
F10 0210 you worry. This machine will cure your cancer-ridden body".
F10 0220    "Cancer"! Mrs& Shaefer practically shrieked. "You
F10 0230 didn't tell me I had cancer".   "You have it, all right.
F10 0240 But as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing
F10 0250 to worry about. Why, I once used this machine to cure a woman with
F10 0260 97 pounds of cancer in her body".   He urged her to buy one
F10 0270 of his machines- for $300. When she said that she didn't have the
F10 0280 money, he said that she could come in for treatment with his office
F10 0290 model until she was ready to buy one. He then sold her minerals to cure
F10 0300 her kidney ailment, a can of sage "to make her look like a girl again",
F10 0310 and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away.
F10 0320    Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs& Shaefer to buy his machine
F10 0330 when she visited him the next day. After another treatment with the machine,
F10 0340 he told her that "her entire body was shot through with tumors
F10 0350 and cysts". He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would
F10 0360 take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money
F10 0370 for buying his machine.   When she submitted to his treatment with
F10 0380 the capsules, Mrs& Shaefer felt intense pain. Leaving Lee's
F10 0390 office, Mrs& Shaefer hurried over to her family physician, who treated
F10 0400 her for burned tissue. For several days, she was ill as a result
F10 0410 of Lee's treatment.   Mrs& Shaefer never got around to
F10 0420 joining the thousand or so people who paid Lee some $30,000 for his ozone
F10 0430 machines. For Mrs& Shaefer- who had been given a clean bill
F10 0440 of health by her own physician at the time she visited Lee- and her
F10 0450 friend were agents for the California Pure Food and Drug Inspection
F10 0460 Bureau. And she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the
F10 0470 evidence of Lee's quack shenanigans, gathered by the tape recorder
F10 0490 under her friend's clothing, proved adequate in court for convicting
F10 0500 Franklin D& Lee. The charge: violation of the California Medical
F10 0510 Practices Act by practicing medicine without a license and selling
F10 0520 misbranded drugs. The sentence: 360 days' confinement in the
F10 0530 county jail.   An isolated case of quackery? By no means. Rather,
F10 0540 it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic
F10 0550 devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands
F10 0560 of Americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them
F10 0570 away from legitimate, ethical medical treatment of serious diseases.
F10 0580 The machine quack makes his Rube Goldberg devices out of odds and
F10 0590 ends of metals, wires, and radio parts.   With these gadgets-
F10 0600 impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs, ticks,
F10 0610 and buzzes- he then carries out a vicious medical con game, capitalizing
F10 0620 on people's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of
F10 0630 our scientific age. He milks the latest scientific advances, translating
F10 0640 them into his own special Buck Rogers vocabulary to huckster his
F10 0650 fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual
F10 0660 impotence and cancer.   The gadget faker operates or sells his
F10 0670 phony machines for $5 to $10,000-
F10 0680 anything the traffic will bear. He
F10 0690 may call himself a naprapath, a physiotherapist, an electrotherapist,
F10 0700 a naturopath, a sanipractor, a medical cultist, a masseur, a "doctor"-
F10 0710 or what have you. Not only do these quacks assume impressive
F10 0720 titles, but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific
F10 0730 or impressive foundations-
F10 0740 foundations which often have little
F10 0750 more than a letterhead existence.   The medical device pirate
F10 0760 of today, of course, is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor
F10 0770 of yesteryear- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake oil and
F10 0780 other patent medicines. His plunder is therefore far higher- running
F10 0790 into hundreds of millions.   According to the Food and Drug
F10 0800 Administration (~FDA), "Doctor" Ghadiali, Dr& Albert
F10 0810 Abrams and his clique, and Dr& Wilhelm Reich- to name three notorious
F10 0820 device quacks- succeeded, respectively, in distributing 10,000,
F10 0830 5000, and 2000 fake health machines.   Authorities believe
F10 0840 that many of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are
F10 0850 still in business. Look at the sums paid by two device quack victims
F10 0860 in Cleveland. Sarah Gross, a dress shop proprietor, paid $1020 to
F10 0870 a masseur, and Mr& A&, a laborer, paid $4200 to a chiropractor for
F10 0880 treatment with two fake health machines- the "radioclast" and
F10 0890 the "diagnometer". Multiply these figures by the millions of people
F10 0900 known to be conned by medical pirates annually. You will come up
F10 0910 with a frightening total.   That's why the ~FDA, the American
F10 0920 Medical Association (~AMA), and the National Better Business
F10 0930 Bureau (~BBB) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery
F10 0940 to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical
F10 0950 charlatans annually.   The Postmaster General recently reported
F10 0960 that mail order frauds- among which fake therapeutic devices
F10 0970 figure prominently- are at the highest level in history. Similarly,
F10 0980 the American Cancer Society (~ACS), the Arthritis and Rheumatism
F10 0990 Foundation, and the ~BBB have each stated lately that medical
F10 1000 quackery is at a new high. For example, the ~BBB has reported
F10 1010 it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and
F10 1020 10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago.   Authorities
F10 1030 hesitate to quote exact figures, however, believing that any
F10 1040 sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation- turned up by
F10 1050 their inevitably limited policing- of the real loot of the medical
F10 1060 racketeer. In this sense, authorities believe that all estimates of phony
F10 1070 device quackery are conservative.   The economic toll that
F10 1080 the device quack extracts is important, of course. But it is our health-
F10 1090 more precious than all the money in the world- that these modern
F10 1100 witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away.
F10 1110 By preying on the sick, by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate,
F10 1120 by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care, these medical
F10 1130 ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity.   Typically,
F10 1140 Sarah Gross and Mr& ~A both lost more than their money
F10 1150 as the result of their experiences with their Cleveland quacks. Sarah
F10 1160 Gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment
F10 1170 by the masseur were not helping her. As a result, she consulted medical
F10 1180 authorities and learned that the devices her quack "doctor" was
F10 1190 using were phony. She suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be
F10 1195 institutionalized.
F10 1200    Mr& A&, her fellow townsman, also experienced
F10 1210 a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been
F10 1220 bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been
F10 1230 treating his wife- a woman suffering from an incurable disease, multiple
F10 1240 sclerosis- and himself. Mr& ~A has recovered, but he is,
F10 1250 justifiably, a bitter man. "That's a lot of hard-earned money to
F10 1260 lose", he says today. "Neither me nor my wife were helped by that
F10 1270 chiropractor's treatments".   And there was the case of Tom
F10 1280 Hepker, a machinist, who was referred by a friend to a health machine
F10 1290 quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what
F10 1300 Doctor Fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine. After
F10 1310 his pains got worse, Tom decided to see a real doctor, from whom he
F10 1320 learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung. Yes, Tom caught
F10 1330 it in time to stay alive. But he's a welfare case now- a human wreck-
F10 1340 thanks to this modern witch doctor.   But the machine quack
F10 1350 can cause far more than just suffering. In such diseases as cancer,
F10 1360 tuberculosis, and heart disease, early diagnosis and treatment are so
F10 1370 vital that the waste of time by the patient with Doctor Fraud's
F10 1380 cure-all gadget can prove fatal. Moreover, the diabetic patient who relies
F10 1390 on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake
F10 1400 can be committing suicide. For instance:   In Chicago,
F10 1410 some time ago, Mr& H&, age 27, a diabetic since he was six, stopped
F10 1415 using
F10 1420 insulin because he had bought a "magic spike"- a glass tube
F10 1430 about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small
F10 1440 fraction of a cent- sold by the Vrilium Company of Chicago for $306
F10 1450 as a cure-all. "Hang this around your neck or attach it to other
F10 1460 parts of your anatomy, and its rays will cure any disease you have",
F10 1470 said the company. Mr& H& is dead today because he followed this
F10 1480 advice.   Doris Hull, suffering from tuberculosis, was taken
F10 1490 by her husband to see Otis G& Carroll, a sanipractor- a licensed
F10 1500 drugless healer- in Spokane. Carroll diagnosed Mrs& Hull by
F10 1510 taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his "radionic"
F10 1520 machine and twirling some knobs (fee $50).   His prescription:
F10 1530 hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water. Although
F10 1540 she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him, Carroll permitted
F10 1550 her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing but water.
F10 1560 Inevitably, Mrs& Hull died of starvation and tuberculosis, weighing
F10 1570 60 pounds. Moreover, her husband and child contracted T&B&
F10 1580 from her. (Small wonder a Spokane jury awarded the husband $35,823
F10 1590 for his wife's death.)   In California, a few years ago, a ghoul
F10 1600 by the name of H& F& Bell sold electric blankets as a cure
F10 1610 for cancer. He did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric
F10 1620 blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors of patients who had died,
F10 1630 reconditioning them, and selling them at $185 each. When authorities
F10 1640 convicted him of practicing medicine without a license (he got off with
F10 1650 a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of
F10 1660 77), one of his victims was not around to testify: He was dead of
F10 1670 cancer.   By no means are these isolated cases. "Unfortunately",
F10 1680 says Chief Postal Inspector David H& Stephens, who has prosecuted
F10 1690 many device quacks, "the ghouls who trade on the hopes of
F10 1700 the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the
F10 1710 patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up
F10 1720 in court". ## DEATH! Have no doubt about it. That's
F10 1730 where device quackery can lead. The evidence shows that fake therapeutic
F10 1740 machines, substituted for valid medical cures, have hastened the
F10 1750 deaths of thousands.   Who are the victims of the device quacks?
F10 1760 Authorities say that oldsters are a prime target. Says Wallace
F10 1770 F& Jannsen, director of the ~FDA's Division of Public Information:
F10 1780 "Quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older
F10 1790 people, or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis, rheumatism,
F10 1800 diabetes, and cancer. People who have not been able to get
F10 1810 relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in
F10 1820 by quacks". The victims of the quacks are frequently poor people, like
F10 1830 Mr& A&, who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice
F10 1840 to Doctor Fraud's avarice. They are often ignorant as well as
F10 1850 underprivileged.
F11 0010    TEN-YEAR-OLD Richard Stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome
F11 0020 for almost a year. His grades had gone steadily downhill, and
F11 0030 he had stopped bringing
F11 0040 friends and classmates home from school.
F11 0050    Mr& and Mrs& Stewart were puzzled and concerned. Then one day
F11 0060 Dick's classmate Jimmy, from next door, let the cat out of the
F11 0070 bag. The youngsters in the boys' class had nicknamed Dick "Bugs
F11 0080 Bunny" because his teeth protruded.   When Richard's parents
F11 0090 told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist- a dentist who
F11 0100 specializes in realigning teeth and jaws- their young son was interested.
F11 0110 During the year that followed, Dick co-operated whole-heartedly
F11 0120 with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved-
F11 0130 an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his
F11 0140 facial appearance.   Richard Stewart is no special case. "The
F11 0150 majority of children in the United States could benefit by some form
F11 0160 of orthodontic treatment", says Dr& Allan G& Brodie, professor
F11 0170 and head of the department of orthodontics at the University of
F11 0180 Illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field.
F11 0190 What do parents need to know about those "years of the braces" in
F11 0200 order not to waste a child's time and their money? How can they
F11 0210 tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment? Why and when should
F11 0220 tooth-straightening be undertaken? What is it likely to cost?
F11 0230 #TOOTH FIT EXPLAINED# OCCLUSION is the dentist's expression
F11 0240 for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed. Malocclusion,
F11 0250 or a bad fit, is what parents need to look out for. One main type
F11 0260 of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper
F11 0270 front teeth. A chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the
F11 0280 face, a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth, an overdeveloped lower
F11 0290 jawbone, and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type
F11 0300 of malocclusion.   These two basic malformations have, of course,
F11 0310 many variations. A child probably requires some form of treatment
F11 0320 if he has any of the following conditions: _@_ A noticeable
F11 0330 protrusion of the upper or lower jaw. _@_ Crooked, overlapping,
F11 0340 twisted, or widely spaced teeth. _@_ Front teeth not meeting
F11 0350 when the back teeth close. _@_ Upper teeth completely covering
F11 0360 the lowers when the back teeth close. _@_ The eyeteeth (third from
F11 0370 the middle on top, counting each front tooth as the first) beginning
F11 0380 to protrude like fangs. _@_ Second teeth that have come in before
F11 0390 the first ones have fallen out, making a double row.   Contrary
F11 0400 to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago, when all malocclusion was
F11 0410 blamed on some unfortunate habit, recent studies show that most tooth
F11 0420 irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition.
F11 0430 However, this does not mean that a child's teeth or jaws must
F11 0440 necessarily resemble those of someone in his family.   Tooth deformity
F11 0450 may be the result of <excessive> thumb- or finger-sucking, tongue-thrusting,
F11 0460 or lip-sucking- but it's important to remember that
F11 0470 there's a difference between <normal> and <excessive> sucking
F11 0480 habits. It's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs, and
F11 0490 no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two
F11 0500 or three years old. Occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect
F11 0510 a youngster's teeth; but after that, if thumb-sucking pressure
F11 0520 is frequent, it will have an effect.   Malocclusion can also
F11 0530 result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long. If a child
F11 0540 loses a molar at the age of two, the adjoining teeth may shift toward
F11 0550 the empty space, thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent
F11 0560 ones and producing a jumble. If baby teeth are retained too long, the
F11 0570 incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal
F11 0580 time or may have to erupt in the wrong place. #CORRECTION CAN SAVE TEETH#
F11 0590 EVERY orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by
F11 0600 their malformed teeth. Some such youngsters rarely smile, or they try
F11 0610 to speak with the mouth closed. In certain cases, as in Dick Stewart's,
F11 0620 a child's personality is affected. Yet from the dentist's
F11 0630 point of view, bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons.
F11 0640    Bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through
F11 0650 a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots. This serious
F11 0660 condition, popularly known as pyorrhea, is one of the chief causes
F11 0670 of tooth loss in adults.   Then, too, misplaced or jammed-together
F11 0680 teeth are prone to trapping food particles, increasing the
F11 0690 likelihood of rapid decay. "For these and other reasons", says Dr&
F11 0700 Brodie, "orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth".
F11 0710    The failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal
F11 0720 chewing, so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden
F11 0730 on his digestive system. Because of these chewing troubles, a child may
F11 0740 avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition. Badly placed
F11 0750 teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping. #THE WHEN AND
F11 0760 HOW OF STRAIGHTENING# "MOST orthodontic work is done on children
F11 0770 between the ages of 10 and 14, though there have been patients
F11 0780 as young as two and as old as 55", says Dr& Brodie.   In
F11 0790 the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed,
F11 0800 yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed
F11 0810 teeth comparatively easy. Orthodontic work is possible because teeth
F11 0820 are held firmly but not rigidly, by a system of peridontal membrane with
F11 0830 an involved nerve network, to the bone in the jaw; they are not
F11 0840 anchored directly to the bone. Abnormal pressure, applied over a period
F11 0850 of time, produces a change in the bony deposit, so a tooth functions
F11 0860 normally in the new position into which it has been guided.   What
F11 0870 can 10-year-old Susan expect when she enters the orthodontist's
F11 0880 office? On her first visit the orthodontist will take ~X rays,
F11 0890 photographs, tooth measurements, and "tooth prints"- an impression
F11 0900 of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws.
F11 0910 If he decides to proceed, he will custom-make for Susie an appliance
F11 0920 consisting of bands, plastic plates, fine wires, and tiny springs. This
F11 0930 appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure
F11 0940 on the bone. As the tooth moves, bone cells on the pressure side
F11 0950 of it will dissolve, and new ones will form on the side from which the
F11 0960 tooth has moved. This must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue
F11 0970 grows, and no faster.   "If teeth are moved too rapidly, serious
F11 0980 injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding
F11 0990 bone holding them in place", explains Dr& Brodie. "Moving one
F11 1000 or two teeth can affect the whole system, and an ill-conceived plan
F11 1010 of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child's face".
F11 1020    During the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately
F11 1030 following each adjustment, Susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness,
F11 1040 but after a short time this will disappear. Parents are often
F11 1050 concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay. When
F11 1060 in place, a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth
F11 1070 that is covered.   Next Susie will enter the treatment stage
F11 1080 and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month, depending on the severity
F11 1090 of her condition. During these visits the dentist will adjust
F11 1100 the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth.   Last comes the
F11 1110 <retention> stage. Susie's teeth have now been guided into a desirable
F11 1120 new position. But because teeth sometimes may drift back to
F11 1130 their original position, a retaining appliance is used to lock them in
F11 1140 place. Usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and
F11 1150 stretching across the teeth. Susie may wear this only at night or for
F11 1160 a few hours during the day.   Then comes the time when the last
F11 1170 wire is removed and Susie walks out a healthier and more attractive
F11 1180 girl than when she first went to the orthodontist.   How long
F11 1190 will this take? Straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may
F11 1200 take only a few months. Aligning all the teeth may take a year or more.
F11 1210 An added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three
F11 1220 years to correct. #WHAT IS THE COST?# THE charge for a
F11 1230 complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country. Work
F11 1240 that might cost $500 to $750 in the South could cost $750 to $1,200
F11 1250 in New York City or Chicago. An average national figure for two
F11 1260 to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1,000.   "Factors
F11 1270 in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill
F11 1280 and education of the practitioner", says Dr& Brodie.   To
F11 1290 become an orthodontist, a man must first be licensed by his state as
F11 1300 a dentist, then he must spend at least two years in additional training
F11 1310 to acquire a license as a specialist.   "Costs may seem high,
F11 1320 but they used to be even higher", says Dr& Brodie. "Fees
F11 1330 are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago".   The
F11 1340 reason? People today are aware of the value of orthodontics, and
F11 1350 as a result there are more practitioners in the field.   Most
F11 1360 orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic
F11 1370 materials and construction of the appliances, but usually the remainder
F11 1380 of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years. In many
F11 1390 cities in the United States clinics associated with dental schools
F11 1400 will take patients at a nominal fee. Some municipal agencies will
F11 1410 pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents. #RESEARCH
F11 1420 HELPS FAMILIES# GROWTH studies have been carried on consistently
F11 1430 by orthodontists. Dr& Brodie has 30-year records of head growth,
F11 1440 started 20 minutes after children's births.   "In the
F11 1450 past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was
F11 1460 scoffed at; now we know that family characteristics <do> affect tooth
F11 1470 formation to a large extent", he says. "Fortunately through our
F11 1480 growth studies we have been able to see what nature does, and that
F11 1490 helps us know what we can do".   This knowledge both modifies
F11 1500 and dictates diagnosis and treatment. For example, a boy may inherit
F11 1510 a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another. In the past
F11 1520 an orthodontist might have tried, over four or five years, to straighten
F11 1530 and fit the boy's large teeth into a jaw that, despite some growth,
F11 1540 would never accommodate them. Now a dentist can recommend extraction
F11 1550 immediately.   In other cases, in view of present-day knowledge
F11 1560 of head growth, orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five
F11 1570 years before treatment. The child is kept on call, and the orthodontist
F11 1580 watches the growth. "Nature often takes care of the problem",
F11 1590 says Dr& Brodie. "A child with a certain type of head and teeth
F11 1600 will outgrow tooth deformity".   That is why Dr& Brodie
F11 1610 asks parents not to insist, against their dentist's advice, that their
F11 1620 child have orthodontic work done too early. "Both because of our
F11 1630 culture's stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions,
F11 1640 some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it
F11 1650 is wise to do so. Let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start
F11 1660 treatment", he urges.   Superior new material for orthodontic
F11 1670 work is another result of research. Plastics are easier to handle
F11 1680 than the vulcanized rubber formerly used, and they save time and money.
F11 1690 Plaster of Paris, once utilized in making impressions of teeth, has
F11 1700 been replaced by alginates (gelatin-like material) that work quickly
F11 1710 and accurately and with least discomfort to a child. #PREVENTION IS
F11 1720 BEST# AS a rule, the earlier general dental treatment is started,
F11 1730 the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be.
F11 1740    "After your child's baby teeth are all in- usually at the age
F11 1750 of two and one half to three- it's time for that first dental appointment",
F11 1760 Dr& Brodie advises. "Then see that your youngster
F11 1770 has a routine checkup once a year".   To help prevent orthodontic
F11 1780 problems from arising, your dentist can do these things: _@_
F11 1790 He can correct decay, thus preventing early loss of teeth. If
F11 1800 a child <does> lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay-
F11 1810 and if no preventive steps are taken- the other teeth may shift out
F11 1820 of position, become overcrowded and malformed. In turn the other teeth
F11 1830 are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them.
F12 0010 From time to time the medium mentions other people "around him",
F12 0020 who were "on the other side", and reports what they are saying. After
F12 0030 a while there come initials and names, and he is interested to hear
F12 0040 some rather unusual family nicknames. As the hour progresses, the
F12 0050 sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific
F12 0060 statements. There are a few prognoses of coming events. ##
F12 0070 ANOTHER MEDIUM, another sitter, would produce a somewhat different
F12 0080 content, but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing
F12 0090 reading. Some mediums speak in practical, down-to-earth terms, while
F12 0100 others may stress the spiritual. Not all, as a matter of fact, consider
F12 0110 themselves "mediums" in the sense of receiving messages from
F12 0120 the deceased. In fact, some sensitives rule this out, preferring to
F12 0130 consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception
F12 0135 (~ESP),
F12 0140 on this side of the "veil". However that may be, people are
F12 0150 known to go to mediums for diverse reasons. Perhaps they are mourning
F12 0160 a recent death and want comfort, to feel in touch with the deceased,
F12 0170 or seek indications for future plans. They may, of course, be curiosity
F12 0180 seekers- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship.
F12 0190    The mediums with whom the Parapsychology Foundation
F12 0200 is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated
F12 0210 state, so that the sitter can make comments, ask and answer questions,
F12 0220 instead of talking with a "control" who speaks through an
F12 0230 entranced sensitive. What we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary
F12 0240 conversation.   But it is not really only a conversation.
F12 0250 Many a sitter (in a personal sitting) has been amazed to realize that
F12 0260 the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind. He himself
F12 0270 might not have been really aware of his own mood; it had been latent,
F12 0280 unspecified, semi-conscious and only partly realized- until she
F12 0290 described it to him! Most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability
F12 0300 to put a finger on "pre-conscious" moods and to clarify them.
F12 0310    However, in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium,
F12 0320 he did not receive a personal reading. Instead he brought with
F12 0330 him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium
F12 0340 knew nothing. For this was to be a "proxy sitting". ## AS
F12 0350 WAS NOTED earlier, it is important that in valid, objective study of
F12 0360 this sort of communication, the interested sitter should be separated
F12 0370 from the sensitive. Dr& Karlis Osis, Director of Research at
F12 0380 the Parapsychology Foundation, described the basis for the experiment
F12 0390 in a TOMORROW article, ("New Research on Survival After
F12 0400 Death", Spring 1958). He remarked: "It has been clearly established
F12 0410 that in a number of instances the message did not come from a
F12 0420 spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter".
F12 0430    The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium's ~ESP
F12 0440 may tap the memory of the sitter, and to do this, the two central
F12 0450 characters in this drama must be separated.   One way to do
F12 0460 this is by "proxy sittings", wherein the person seeking a message
F12 0470 does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute,
F12 0480 the proxy sitter. If the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter
F12 0490 except his name (given by the experimenter), he cannot possibly
F12 0500 give any clues, conscious or unconscious, far less ask leading questions.
F12 0510 All he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner, seeking
F12 0520 to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal
F12 0530 impressions.   Sometimes in these experiments "appointment
F12 0540 sittings" are used. Here the absent sitter makes a "date"
F12 0550 with a communicator (someone close to him who is deceased), asking him
F12 0560 to "come in" at a certain hour, when a channel will be open for
F12 0570 him. In this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator,
F12 0580 nothing else. He gives this to the medium at the appointed
F12 0590 time, and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages
F12 0600 from the communicator. As always, a tape recording or detailed
F12 0610 notes are made, and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter.
F12 0620    So this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier
F12 0630 between the medium's ~ESP and the absent sitter's mind. It
F12 0640 is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements- though
F12 0650 research still does not know how far afield ~ESP <can> range.
F12 0660 ## NOW THE ORIGINAL absent sitter must decide whether the
F12 0670 statements are meaningful to <him>. Here again laboratory approaches
F12 0680 are being evolved, for it is recognized how "elastic" these readings
F12 0690 can be, how they can apply to many people, and are often stated
F12 0700 in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case.
F12 0710 If you look at a reading meant for someone else, you will probably
F12 0720 see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you,
F12 0730 even when you were not in the picture at all! An interested sitter
F12 0740 may think the sensitive has made a "hit", describing something accurately
F12 0750 for him, but can he really be sure that another sitter, hearing
F12 0760 the same statement, would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances?
F12 0770 It is, of course, easy to see how "~J" will mean
F12 0780 Uncle Jack to one person and little Jane to another. "A journey",
F12 0785 "a
F12 0790 little white house", "a change of outlook", can apply to many
F12 0800 people. And even more complex items can be interpreted to conform
F12 0810 to one's own point of view, which is by nature so personal. One sitter
F12 0820 may think "a leather couch" identifies a reading as surely directed
F12 0830 to him; to another, it seems that nobody but his father ever
F12 0840 used the phrase, "Atta boy"!   To get around this quite difficult
F12 0850 corner, there is one first aid to objectiveness: prevent the
F12 0860 distant sitter from knowing which reading <was> for him. If he is
F12 0870 not told which of four or five readings was meant for him, he can more
F12 0880 readily assess each item in a larger frame: "Does that statement
F12 0890 really sound as if it were for me, significant in my particular life?
F12 0900 Or am I taking something that could really apply to almost anybody,
F12 0910 and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar
F12 0920 experience"?   Conversely, experimenters would consider as impressive
F12 0930 such statements as the following, which, if they turned out
F12 0940 to be hits, are so unusual as to be really significant:   "He
F12 0950 had four children, two sets of twins. After being a lawyer for twenty-five
F12 0960 years he started studying for the ministry. Part of his house
F12 0970 had been moved to the other side of the road. He died of typhoid in
F12 0980 1921".   Methods have been developed of assigning "weights"
F12 0990 to statements; that is, it is known empirically that names beginning
F12 1000 with ~R are more common than those beginning with ~Z; that
F12 1010 fewer women are named Miranda than Elizabeth; that in the United
F12 1020 States more people die of heart disease than of smallpox. So each reading
F12 1030 can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these
F12 1040 weights. Specific dates would be important, as would double names.
F12 1050 Various categories have been explored to find out about these "empirical
F12 1060 probabilities" against which to measure the readings. ## IN
F12 1070 THE PARAPSYCHOLOGY FOUNDATION'S long-range experiment, readings
F12 1080 are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating
F12 1090 sitters, trying to throw light on this question of the significance
F12 1100 of mediumistic statements. It is very important indeed, in the field
F12 1110 of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis,
F12 1120 to know whether the statements are actually only those which any
F12 1130 intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself.
F12 1140 Or, on the other hand, are unlikely facts being stated, facts which are
F12 1150 in themselves significant and <not> easily applicable to everybody?
F12 1160 That is one thing the experiments are designed to find out.
F12 1170    So, after the sitting has been held, several readings at one time
F12 1180 are mailed, and the distant sitter (whose name or whose communicator's
F12 1190 name was given to the medium) must mark each little item as Correct
F12 1200 (Hit), Incorrect (Miss), Doubtful, or Especially Significant (applying
F12 1210 to him and, he feels, not to anyone else). He is required to
F12 1220 mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his.
F12 1230 All these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated, by adding
F12 1240 up the Hits and Significants, with the weight placed on those in the
F12 1250 sitter's own reading. That is, if he marks as most correct a reading
F12 1260 <not> meant for him, the total experimental score falls.   Conversely,
F12 1270 if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading, and finds more
F12 1280 accurate facts in it than in the others, a point is chalked up for
F12 1290 the intrinsic, objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material.
F12 1300 And there are some positive results, though the final findings
F12 1310 will not be known for a long time- and then further research can
F12 1320 be formulated.   In another approach to the same procedure, the
F12 1330 content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium
F12 1340 is likely to slant her statements. Does she often speak of locations,
F12 1350 of cause of death? Does she accurately give dates, ages, kind
F12 1360 of occupation? It is possible to find out in which categories most
F12 1370 of her correct statements fall, and where she makes most of her "hits".
F12 1380 Now when, so to speak, the cream has been skimmed off, and the
F12 1390 items in the successful categories separated out, the sitter can be asked
F12 1400 to consider and rate only this concentrated "cream", where the
F12 1410 sensitive is at her best. ## MEDIUMISTIC IMPRESSIONS are evidently
F12 1420 of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses. "I feel cold",
F12 1430 the medium says, or "My leg aches", "My head is heavy".
F12 1440 Or perhaps she hears words or sounds: "There's such a noise
F12 1450 of loud machinery", or "I hear a child crying", or "He says
F12 1460 we're all here and glad to see you". Maybe an entire scene comes
F12 1470 into consciousness, with action and motion, or a static view: "a
F12 1480 house under a pine tree, with a little stone path going up to the door".
F12 1490 The sensitive often seems to smell definite odors, too, or subjectively
F12 1500 feels emotions. Sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery
F12 1510 and seems to see all details in perspective, as if the scene were actually
F12 1520 there. If pressed by the sitter for more detail, she may be able
F12 1530 to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply, almost
F12 1540 as if she were physically going closer.   If asked how she gets
F12 1550 her impressions, she probably can only say that she "just gets them"-
F12 1560 some more vividly than others. Perhaps this is not so extraordinary
F12 1570 after all. Even in normal experience one gets impressions without
F12 1580 knowing exactly how- of atmosphere, of one another's personalities,
F12 1590 moods, intentions.   Of course, there is an element of training
F12 1600 here: these gifted people, by concentration, study, guidance,
F12 1605 have
F12 1610 learned to develop their power. Simply <using> it increases its intensity,
F12 1620 I was told by one sensitive.   Nor does a medium automatically
F12 1630 know how to interpret her imagery. Impressions often appear in
F12 1640 a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value. It is apparently
F12 1650 by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious, and the medium
F12 1660 has to translate these into meaning. If communication with an entity
F12 1670 on the "other side" is taking place, this too may assume the form
F12 1680 of clairvoyant symbolism.   During one reading an image appeared
F12 1690 of a prisoner in irons. But this did not necessarily refer to an
F12 1700 actual jail; taken with other details it could have referred to a state
F12 1710 of mental or spiritual confinement. In this connection it is worth
F12 1720 noting how names are sometimes obtained. Though they are often heard
F12 1730 clairaudiently, as if a voice were speaking them, in other cases they
F12 1740 are apprehended visually as symbols: a slope to signify the name
F12 1750 "Hill", for instance. One medium saw two sheets flapping on a line
F12 1760 and found that the name Shietz was significant to the sitter.
F13 0010 _@_ Farming is confining. The farmer's life must be arranged
F13 0020 to meet the demands of crops and livestock.   Livestock must be
F13 0030 tended every day, routinely. A slight change in the work schedule may
F13 0040 cut the production of cows or chickens.   Even if there are no
F13 0050 livestock, the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods, particularly
F13 0060 during the growing season.   The worker who lives on a farm
F13 0070 cannot change jobs readily. He cannot leave the farm to take work
F13 0080 in another locality on short notice; such a move may mean a loss of
F13 0090 capital. _@_ Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part
F13 0100 of farm life. The farmer must get up early, and, at times, work late
F13 0110 at night. Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold
F13 0120 rain. No matter how well work is planned, bad weather or unexpected
F13 0130 setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up.   It may
F13 0140 not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery
F13 0150 that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably. _@_ Production
F13 0160 may fall far below expectations. Drought, hail, disease, and insects
F13 0170 take their toll of crops. Sickness or loss of some of the livestock
F13 0180 may cut into the owner's earnings, even into his capital. _@_
F13 0190 Returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good
F13 0200 year.   The high cost of land, supplies, and labor make it difficult
F13 0210 to farm profitably on a part-time basis. Land within commuting
F13 0230 distance of a growing city is usually high in price, higher if it has
F13 0240 subdivision possibilities. Part-time farmers generally must pay higher
F13 0250 prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller
F13 0260 quantities. If the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high,
F13 0270 farm labor costs will also be high.   A part-time farmer needs
F13 0280 unusual skill to get as high production per hen, per cow, or per acre
F13 0290 as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer. It will frequently
F13 0300 be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment. He
F13 0310 may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations,
F13 0320 such as spraying or threshing, and for these, he may have to wait his
F13 0330 turn. There will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he
F13 0340 is away at his off-farm job. _@_ The farm may be an additional
F13 0350 burden if the main job is lost. This may be true whether the farm is
F13 0360 owned or rented.   If the farm is rented, the rent must be paid.
F13 0370 If it is owned, taxes must be paid, and if the place is not free
F13 0380 of mortgage, there will be interest and
F13 0390 payments on the principal to take care of. _ADVANTAGES_ _@_A
F13 0400 farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children.
F13 0410 It gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air. The children can
F13 0420 do chores adapted to their age and ability. Caring for a calf, a pig,
F13 0430 or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for
F13 0440 work. _@_ Part-time farming gives a measure of security if the
F13 0450 regular job is lost, <provided> the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes
F13 0460 enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs.
F13 0470 _@_ For some retired persons, part-time farming is a good way
F13 0480 to supplement retirement income. It is particularly suitable for those
F13 0490 who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health. _@_
F13 0500 Generally, the s
F13 0510 ame level of living costs less in the country than
F13 0520 in the city. The savings are not as great, however, as is sometime supposed.
F13 0530 Usually, the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on
F13 0540 the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more.
F13 0550 Where schools, fire and police protection, and similar municipal services
F13 0560 are of equal quality in city and country, real estate taxes are
F13 0570 usually about the same. _@_ A part-time farmer and his family can
F13 0580 use their spare time profitably. _@_ Some persons consider the
F13 0590 work on a farm recreational. For some white-collar workers it is a
F13 0600 welcome change from the regular job, and a physical conditioner. #LAND,
F13 0610 LABOR, AND EQUIPMENT NEEDED# Part-time farming can take comparatively
F13 0620 little land, labor, and equipment- or a great deal. It depends
F13 0630 on the kind and the scale of the farming operation.   General
F13 0640 requirements for land, labor, and equipment are discussed below. Specific
F13 0650 requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed
F13 0660 on pages 8 to 14. _LAND_ Three quarters to 1 acre of good land
F13 0670 is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use, and for a
F13 0680 small flock of chickens, a cow, and two pigs. You could not, of course,
F13 0690 raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small.   If you
F13 0700 want to
F13 0710 raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale, you'll
F13 0720 need more land.   In deciding how much land you want, take into
F13 0730 account the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect. But
F13 0740 consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your
F13 0750 other work. The cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in
F13 0760 value may influence your decision. Some part-time farmers buy more
F13 0770 land than they need in anticipation of suburban development. This is
F13 0780 a highly speculative venture.   Sometimes a desired acreage is offered
F13 0790 only as part of a larger tract. When surplus land is not expensive
F13 0800 to buy or to keep up, it is usually better to buy it than to buy
F13 0810 so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might
F13 0820 impair the residential value of the farm. _LABOR_ If you have a
F13 0830 year-round, full-time job you can't expect to grow much more than your
F13 0840 family uses- unless other members of the family do a good deal of
F13 0850 the work or you hire help. As a rule, part-time farmers hire little
F13 0860 help.   In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor,
F13 0870 compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with
F13 0880 the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1.   List
F13 0890 the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month.
F13 0900 You may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have
F13 0910 one. Do not include all your spare time or all your family's spare
F13 0920 time- only what you are willing to use for farm work. _EQUIPMENT_
F13 0930 If you are going to produce for home use only, you will need only
F13 0940 hand tools. You will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing,
F13 0950 however.   For larger plantings, you'll need some kind of power
F13 0960 for plowing, harrowing, disking, and cultivating. If you have a planting
F13 0970 of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor
F13 0980 (available for $300 to $500 with attachments, 1960 prices). These
F13 0990 tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing, particularly on heavier
F13 1000 soils, so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing.
F13 1010    Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the
F13 1020 small-scale farmer. If you are going to farm for extra cash income on
F13 1030 a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments
F13 1040 when you choose among farm enterprises.   You can keep your
F13 1050 machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery, by sharing
F13 1060 the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor, and by hiring
F13 1070 someone with machinery to do certain jobs. If an expensive and specialized
F13 1080 piece of machinery is needed- such as a spray rig, a combine,
F13 1090 or a binder- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work.
F13 1100 #SELECTING A FARM# Before you look for a farm you'll need
F13 1110 to know (1) the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake; and
F13 1120 (2)
F13 1130 whether you want to buy or rent.   Information on pages 8 to 14
F13 1140 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture.
F13 1150    If you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish
F13 1160 to locate, or if you are not sure that you and your family will like
F13 1170 and make a success of farming, usually you would do better to rent
F13 1180 a place for a year or two before you buy.   Discussed below are
F13 1190 some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm.
F13 1200 _LOCATION_ _NEARNESS TO WORK.-_ Choose a location within easy
F13 1210 commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities.
F13 1220 Then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell
F13 1230 the farm. The presence of alternative job opportunities also will
F13 1240 make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable.
F13 1250 Obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road. _NEARNESS TO
F13 1260 MARKETS.-_ If you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby.
F13 1270 If you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk, for example,
F13 1280 you should be close to a town or city. _KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD.-_
F13 1290 Look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes. There are slums
F13 1300 in the country as well as in the city. Few rural areas are protected
F13 1310 by zoning. A tavern, filling station, junk yard, rendering plant,
F13 1320 or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to
F13 1330 hurt its value. _FACILITIES IN THE AREA.-_ Check on the schools
F13 1340 in the area, the quality of teaching, and the provision for transportation
F13 1350 to and from them.   Find out whether fire protection, sewage
F13 1360 system, gas, water mains, and electrical lines are available in the
F13 1370 locality. If these facilities are not at the door, getting them may
F13 1380 cost more than you expect. You may have to provide them yourself or
F13 1390 get along without them.   You cannot get along without an adequate
F13 1400 supply of pure water. If you are considering a part-time farm where
F13 1410 the water must be provided by a well, find out if there is a good well
F13 1420 on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled. A pond may
F13 1430 provide adequate water for livestock and garden. Pond water can be filtered
F13 1440 for human use, but most part-time farmers would not want to go
F13 1450 to so much trouble. The following amounts of water are needed per day
F13 1460 for livestock and domestic uses. _TOPOGRAPHY AND SOIL_ Is the land
F13 1470 suited to the crops you intend to raise? If you can't tell, get
F13 1480 help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist.
F13 1490 Soil type, drainage, or degree of slope can make the difference between
F13 1500 good crops and poor ones. Small areas that aren't right for a certain
F13 1510 crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop. _THE
F13 1520 HOUSE_ Will the house on any part-time farm you are considering
F13 1530 make a satisfactory full-time residence? How much will it cost to
F13 1540 do any necessary modernizing and redecorating? If the house is not
F13 1550 wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating
F13 1560 system must be installed, check into the cost of making these improvements.
F13 1570 #BUYING A FARM# The value of the farm to you will depend
F13 1580 on- _@_ Its worth as a place to live. _@_ The value of
F13 1590 the products you can raise on it. _@_ The possibilities of selling
F13 1600 the property later on for suburban subdivision.   Decide first
F13 1610 what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison
F13 1620 with what it would cost to live in town. Take into account the difference
F13 1630 in city and county taxes, insurance rates, utility rates, and
F13 1640 the cost of travel to work.   Next, estimate the value of possible
F13 1650 earnings of the farm. To do this, set up a plan on paper for operating
F13 1660 the farm. List the kind and quantity of things the farm can be
F13 1670 expected to produce in an average year. Estimate the value of the produce
F13 1680 at normal prices. The total is the probable gross income from farming.
F13 1690    To find estimated net farm income, subtract estimated
F13 1700 annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming. Include
F13 1710 as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings
F13 1720 and equipment. Also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be
F13 1730 contributed by the family. It may be hard to decide what this labor
F13 1740 is worth, but charge something for it. Otherwise, you may pay too much
F13 1750 for the farm and get nothing for your labor.   To figure the
F13 1760 value of the farm in terms of investment income, divide the estimated
F13 1770 annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get
F13 1780 in interest if the money were invested in some other way.
F14 0010 Everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his
F14 0020 day in court as in some vast collective dirge. For almost two months,
F14 0030 the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the
F14 0040 grave about fathers and mothers, graybeards, adolescents, babies, starved,
F14 0050 beaten to death, strangled, machine-gunned, gassed, burned. One
F14 0060 who had been a boy in Auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected
F14 0070 by height for the gas chambers. The gruesome humor of the Nazis
F14 0080 was not forgotten- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name
F14 0090 of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star of David- nor
F14 0100 the gratuitous sadism of ~SS officers. Public relations strategists
F14 0110 everywhere, watching the reaction of the German press, the liberal
F14 0120 press, the lunatic-fringe press, listening to their neighbors, studying
F14 0130 interviews with men and women on the street, cried out: Too much,
F14 0140 too much- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled, the horrors
F14 0150 are losing their effect. And still another witness, one who had crawled
F14 0160 out from under a heap of corpses, had to tell how the victims had
F14 0170 been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before
F14 0180 being shot. **h   Most of this testimony may have been legally
F14 0190 admissible as bearing on the <corpus delicti> of the total Nazi
F14 0200 crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it
F14 0210 of the defendant's Department of Jewish Affairs. Counsel for the
F14 0220 defense, however, shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current
F14 0230 of dreadful recollections, rarely raised an objection. Would not the
F14 0240 emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming,
F14 0250 if not exhausting, effect likely to improve his client's chances?
F14 0260 Those who feared "emotionalism" at the Trial showed less
F14 0270 understanding than Dr& Servatius of the route by which man achieves
F14 0280 the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies. Interruptions
F14 0290 came
F14 0300 largely from the bench, which numerous times rebuked the Attorney
F14 0310 General for letting his witnesses run on, though it, too, made no serious
F14 0320 effort to choke off the flow.   But there was a contrast even
F14 0330 more decisive than a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem
F14 0340 and those in Moscow and New York. In each of the last, the trial
F14 0350 <marked the beginning of a new course:> in Moscow the liquidation
F14 0360 of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin's dictatorship;
F14 0370 in the United States the initiation of militant anti-Communism,
F14 0380 with the repentant ex-Communist in the vanguard. These trials were
F14 0390 properly termed "political cases" in that the trial itself was
F14 0400 a political act producing political consequences. But what could the
F14 0410 Eichmann Trial initiate? Of what new course could it mark the beginning?
F14 0420 The Eichmann case looked to the past, not to the future.
F14 0430 It was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection,
F14 0440 and of refining the recollection, that will last as long as there
F14 0450 are Jews. As such, it was beyond politics and had no need of justification
F14 0460 by a "message". ## "IT IS NOT AN individual
F14 0470 that is in the dock at this historical trial"- said Ben Gurion,
F14 0480 "and not the Nazi regime alone- but anti-Semitism throughout
F14 0490 history". How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to
F14 0500 maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews
F14 0510 <without being an anti-Semite> contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism?
F14 0520 And if it was not an individual who was in the dock, why
F14 0530 was the Trial, as we shall observe later, all but scuttled in the
F14 0540 attempt to prove Eichmann a "fiend"? These questions touch the
F14 0550 root of confusion in the prosecution's case.   It might be contended,
F14 0560 of course, that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic
F14 0570 feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism.
F14 0580 But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined
F14 0590 by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment. In such a case
F14 0600 the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied
F14 0610 to the issue by argument. One who could be linked to anti-Semitism
F14 0620 only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the
F14 0630 Jew-baiter throughout the ages. Shout at Eichmann though he might,
F14 0640 the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying
F14 0650 the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally
F14 0660 recognized category of anti-Semitism. Yes, he believed that the
F14 0670 Jews were "enemies of the Reich", and such a belief is, of course,
F14 0680 typical of "patriotic" anti-Semites; but he believed in the
F14 0690 Jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract, theological way, like a member
F14 0700 of a cult speculating on the nature of things. The real question was
F14 0710 how one passed from anti-Semitism of this sort to murder, and the answer
F14 0720 to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself. In
F14 0725 regard to Eichmann,
F14 0730 it was to be found in the Nazi outlook, which contained
F14 0740 a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism, a
F14 0750 principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent.
F14 0760 Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could,
F14 0770 as Eichmann declared, feel personally friendly toward the
F14 0780 Jews and still be their murderer. Not through fear of disobeying orders,
F14 0790 as Eichmann kept trying to explain, but through a peculiar giddiness
F14 0800 that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained
F14 0810 in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler's
F14 0820 victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical
F14 0830 rightness that was able to respond to any proposal, and the more outrageous
F14 0840 the better, "Well, let's try it". At any rate, the substance
F14 0850 of Eichmann's testimony was that all his actions flowed from
F14 0860 his membership in the party and the ~SS, and though the Prosecutor
F14 0870 did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews, his success
F14 0880 on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to
F14 0890 that extent. ## BUT IF THE Trial did not expose the special
F14 0900 Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened
F14 0910 to light, neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary
F14 0920 anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany
F14 0930 and wherever else they could find it. If anti-Semitism was on trial
F14 0940 in Jerusalem, why was it not identified, and with enough emphasis
F14 0950 to capture the notice of the world press, in its connection with the
F14 0960 activities of Eichmann's Department of Jewish Affairs, as exemplified
F14 0970 by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites
F14 0980 in Germany, as well as in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary?
F14 0990 The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich in January
F14 1000 1942, to organize the material and technical means to put to death
F14 1010 the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe, was
F14 1020 attended by representatives of major organs of the German state, including
F14 1030 the Reich Minister of the Interior, the State Secretary in
F14 1040 charge of the Four Year Plan, the Reich Minister of Justice, the
F14 1050 Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs. The measures for annihilation
F14 1060 proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry, transportation,
F14 1070 civilian agencies of government. Heydrich, in opening the Conference,
F14 1080 followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order
F14 1090 issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as
F14 1100 " a complement to" previous "solutions" for eliminating the Jews
F14 1110 from German living space through violence, economic strangulation,
F14 1120 forced emigration, and evacuation. In other words, the promulgators
F14 1130 of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews
F14 1140 was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating
F14 1150 in every phase of German life, and that the new conspiracy counted on
F14 1160 the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective, as
F14 1170 a readiness for murder. This, in fact, it turned out to be. Since
F14 1180 the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible, once the wheels had
F14 1190 began to turn, persons controlling German industries, social institutions,
F14 1200 and armed forces became, through their anti-Semitism or their
F14 1210 tolerance of it, conscious accomplices of Hitler's crimes; whether
F14 1220 in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually.
F14 1230    What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn
F14 1240 the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the
F14 1250 exact link between the respectable anti-Semite and the concentration-camp
F14 1260 brute? Not in Eichmann's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism
F14 1270 of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning
F14 1280 of the Trial. No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had
F14 1290 conceived their anti-Semitism as an "innocent" dislike of Jews,
F14 1300 as do others like them today. The Final Solution proved that the
F14 1310 Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the
F14 1320 criminality and madness of others. Ought not an edifying Trial have
F14 1330 made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how
F14 1340 representative types of "mere" anti-Semites were drawn step by
F14 1350 step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings? The Prosecutor
F14 1360 in his opening remarks did refer to "the germ of anti-Semitism"
F14 1370 among the Germans which Hitler "stimulated and transformed". But
F14 1380 if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann's
F14 1385 head
F14 1390 at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned, the press
F14 1400 seems to have missed it. ## NOR DID THE Trial devote much
F14 1410 attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis,
F14 1420 both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations
F14 1430 and states. Certainly, one of the best ways of warning the
F14 1440 world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous
F14 1450 weapon. Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-Jew
F14 1460 can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society
F14 1470 into a menace to <all> his neighbors. Do patriots everywhere know
F14 1480 enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in
F14 1490 the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations, splitting
F14 1500 apart individuals and groups, arousing the meanest and most dishonest
F14 1510 impulses, pulverizing trust and personal dignity, and finally
F14 1520 forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them
F14 1530 partners in unspeakable crimes? The career of Eichmann made the Trial
F14 1540 a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization: fearful
F14 1550 of being mistaken for a Jew, he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform;
F14 1560 clinging to the enemy-Jew idea, he is forced to overcome habits of
F14 1570 politeness and neighborliness; once in power he begins to give vent
F14 1580 to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania
F14 1590 and envy of those above him. "Is this the type of citizen you
F14 1600 desire"? the Trial should have asked the nations. But though this
F14 1610 characterization in no way diminished Eichmann's guilt, the Prosecutor,
F14 1620 more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a
F14 1630 political one, would have none of it.   Finally, if the mission
F14 1640 of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism, how could it have failed
F14 1650 to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which
F14 1660 the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters- i&e&,
F14 1670 Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia- and those in which it
F14 1680 met the obstacle of human solidarity- Denmark, Holland, Italy, Bulgaria,
F14 1690 France? Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an
F14 1700 outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism
F14 1710 proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose
F14 1720 citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports? Wasn't
F14 1730 this meaning of Eichmann's experience in various countries
F14 1740 worth highlighting?
F14 1750 ## AS THE FIRST collective confrontation
F14 1760 of the Nazi outrage, the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery
F14 1770 of the Jews from the shock of the death camps, a recovery that took fifteen
F14 1780 years and which is still by no means complete (though let no one
F14 1790 believe that it could be hastened by silence). Only across a distance
F14 1800 of time could the epic accounting begin. It is already difficult to
F14 1810 recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to
F14 1820 the Jews of Europe. It is not that the facts of the persecution were
F14 1830 unavailable; most of the information elicited in Jerusalem had
F14 1840 been brought to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals and
F14 1850 investigating commissions, and by reports, memoirs, and survivors'
F14 1860 accounts.
F15 0010 IN POUGHKEEPSIE, N& Y&, in 1952, a Roman Catholic hospital
F15 0020 presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the
F15 0030 Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff.
F15 0040 Three agreed, but four declined and were suspended. After a flood of
F15 0050 protests, they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953. The peace
F15 0060 of the community
F15 0070 was badly disturbed, and people across the nation, reading of the
F15 0080 incident, felt uneasy.   In New York City in 1958, the city's
F15 0090 Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide
F15 0100 a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device. He thereby precipitated
F15 0110 a bitter controversy involving Protestants, Jews and Roman
F15 0120 Catholics that continued for two months, until the city's Board
F15 0130 of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy.   A year
F15 0140 later in Albany, N& Y&, a Roman Catholic hospital barred an
F15 0150 orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned Parenthood
F15 0160 Association. Immediately, the religious groups of the city were
F15 0170 embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man's
F15 0180 right to freedom of religious belief and conscience.   These incidents,
F15 0190 typical of many others, dramatize the distressing fact that no
F15 0200 controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension,
F15 0210 rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control
F15 0220 issue. It has flared up periodically on the front pages of
F15 0230 newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in
F15 0240 municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies. It has erupted
F15 0250 on the national level in the matter of including birth-control
F15 0260 information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries. Where
F15 0270 it is not actually erupting, it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment
F15 0280 like a volcano, ready to explode at any moment.   The
F15 0290 time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove
F15 0300 this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life
F15 0310 of our nation.   The first step toward the goal is the establishment
F15 0320 of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication
F15 0330 on other than the polemical level. Instead of emotional recrimination,
F15 0340 loaded phrases and sloganeering, we need a dispassionate study
F15 0350 of the facts, a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more
F15 0360 serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is
F15 0370 reached.   "All too frequently", points out James O'Gara,
F15 0380 managing editor of <Commonweal>, "Catholics run roughshod over
F15 0390 Protestant sensibilities in this matter, by failure to consider the
F15 0400 reasoning behind the Protestant position and, particularly, by their
F15 0410 jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth control has changed
F15 0420 in recent decades". All too often our language is unduly
F15 0425 harsh.
F15 0430    The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement-
F15 0440 frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting-
F15 0450 already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the
F15 0460 over-all objectives of family planning. Instead of Catholics' being
F15 0470 obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number
F15 0480 of offspring, as many non-Catholics imagine, the ideal of <responsible>
F15 0490 parenthood is stressed. Family planning is encouraged, so that parents
F15 0500 will be able to provide properly for their offspring.   Pope
F15 0510 Pius /12, declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from
F15 0520 the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the
F15 0530 whole duration of married life, if there are serious reasons, such as
F15 0540 those often mentioned in the so-called medical, eugenic, economic and
F15 0550 social "indications". This means that such factors as the health
F15 0560 of the parents, particularly the mother, their ability to provide their
F15 0570 children with the necessities of life, the degree of population density
F15 0580 of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately
F15 0590 be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring.
F15 0600    These are substantially the same factors considered by non-Catholics
F15 0610 in family planning. The laws of many states permit birth control
F15 0620 only for medical reasons. The Roman Catholic Church, however,
F15 0630 sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning.   Catholics,
F15 0640 Protestants and Jews are in agreement over the objectives of
F15 0650 family planning, but disagree over the methods to be used. The Roman
F15 0660 Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method, also
F15 0670 known as the use of the infertile or safe period. The Church considers
F15 0680 this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author:
F15 0690 It involves no frustration of nature's laws, but simply an intelligent
F15 0700 and disciplined use of them. With the exception of the Roman
F15 0710 Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches, most churches make no
F15 0720 moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives,
F15 0730 allowing the couple free choice.   Here is a difference in
F15 0740 theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement. The
F15 0750 grounds for the Church's position are Scriptural (Old Testament),
F15 0760 the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church, the
F15 0770 unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries, the decisions of the highest
F15 0780 ecclesiastical authority and the natural law. The latter plays a prominent
F15 0790 role in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive,
F15 0800 entirely apart from Scripture, in determining the ethical character of
F15 0810 birth-prevention methods.   The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition
F15 0820 regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of
F15 0830 the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual
F15 0840 love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end. This conclusion
F15 0850 is based on two propositions: that man by the use of his reason
F15 0860 can ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God makes known
F15 0870 His purpose by certain "given" physical arrangements.   Thus,
F15 0880 man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal
F15 0890 act is procreation, the propagation of the race. Moreover, man
F15 0900 may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by
F15 0910 God, who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for
F15 0920 the control of conception. Believing that God is the Author of this
F15 0930 law and of all laws of nature, Roman Catholics believe that they are
F15 0940 obliged to obey those laws, not frustrate or mock them.   Let
F15 0950 it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between
F15 0960 Protestants and Roman Catholics appear to be irreconcilable. But
F15 0970 people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines, without
F15 0980 taking up arms against those who disagree with them. Why is it
F15 0990 so different in regard to birth control? It is because each side has
F15 1000 sought to <implement> its distinctive theological belief through legislation
F15 1010 and thus indirectly <force> its belief, or at least the practical
F15 1020 consequences thereof, upon others.   It is always a temptation
F15 1030 for a religious organization, especially a powerful or dominant
F15 1040 one, to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint
F15 1050 upon others. Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed
F15 1060 to this temptation in the past.   Consider what happened during
F15 1070 World War /1,, when the Protestant churches united to push the
F15 1080 Prohibition law through Congress. Many of them sincerely believe
F15 1090 that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically
F15 1100 evil and sinful. With over four million American men away at war, Protestants
F15 1110 forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general
F15 1120 public. With the return of our soldiers, it soon became apparent that
F15 1130 the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens. The attempt
F15 1140 to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers, racketeers,
F15 1150 hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled
F15 1160 in our history. The so-called "noble experiment" came to an
F15 1170 inglorious end.   That tumultuous, painful and costly experience
F15 1180 shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced
F15 1190 when it has little correspondence with the general view of society.
F15 1200 That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control
F15 1210 today.   Up to the turn of the century, contraception was condemned
F15 1220 by <all> Christian churches as immoral, unnatural and contrary
F15 1230 to divine law. This was generally reflected in the civil laws of Christian
F15 1240 countries. Today, the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches
F15 1250 stand virtually alone in holding that conviction. The various Lambeth
F15 1260 Conferences, expressing the Anglican viewpoint, mirror the gradual
F15 1270 change that has taken place among Protestants generally.
F15 1280 In 1920, the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception
F15 1290 and issued "an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural
F15 1300 means for the avoidance of conception, together with the grave dangers-
F15 1310 physical, moral, and religious- thereby incurred, and against
F15 1320 the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race". Denouncing
F15 1330 the view that the sexual union is an end in itself, the Conference
F15 1340 declared: "We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded
F15 1350 as the governing considerations of Christian marriage. One is the
F15 1360 primary purpose for which marriage exists, namely, the continuance
F15 1370 of the race through the gift and heritage of children; the other is
F15 1380 the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful
F15 1390 self-control". The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against
F15 1400 the open or secret sale of contraceptives.   In 1930, the Lambeth
F15 1410 Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be
F15 1420 the procreation of children, but conceded that, in certain limited circumstances,
F15 1430 contraception might be morally legitimate.   In 1958,
F15 1440 the Conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by
F15 1450 God on parents everywhere.   Many other Protestant denominations
F15 1460 preceded the Anglicans in such action. In March, 1931, 22 out
F15 1470 of 28 members of a committee of the Federal Council of Churches ratified
F15 1480 artificial methods of birth control. "As to the necessity",
F15 1490 the committee declared, "for some form of effective control of the
F15 1500 size of the family and the spacing of children, and consequently of control
F15 1510 of conception, there can be no question **h. There is general agreement
F15 1520 also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression
F15 1530 of mutual affection <without> relation to procreation is right".
F15 1540    Since then, many Protestant denominations have made separate
F15 1550 pronouncements, in which they not only approved birth control, but declared
F15 1560 it at times to be a <religious duty>. What determines the morality,
F15 1570 they state, is not the <means> used, but the <motive>. In
F15 1580 general, the means (excluding abortion) that prove most effective are
F15 1590 considered the most ethical.   This development is reflected in
F15 1600 the action taken in February, 1961, by the general board of the
F15 1605 National
F15 1610 Council of Churches, the largest Protestant organization in the
F15 1620 ~US. The board approved and commended the use of birth-control
F15 1630 devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning. It
F15 1640 called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting
F15 1650 the information or availability of contraceptives.   The general
F15 1660 board declared: "Most of the Protestant churches hold contraception
F15 1670 and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are
F15 1680 right **h. The general Protestant conviction is that motives, rather
F15 1690 than methods, form the primary moral issue, provided the methods are
F15 1700 limited to the prevention of conception".   An action once universally
F15 1710 condemned by all Christian churches and forbidden by the civil
F15 1720 law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant
F15 1730 denominations, but also deemed, at certain times, to be a positive
F15 1740 <religious duty>. This viewpoint has now been translated into
F15 1750 action by the majority of people in this country. Repeated polls have
F15 1760 disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the
F15 1770 practice of birth control.   For all concerned with social-welfare
F15 1780 legislation, the significance of this radical and revolutionary
F15 1790 change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American
F15 1800 people is clear, profound and far-reaching. To try to oppose the general
F15 1810 religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative
F15 1820 fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was
F15 1830 occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment.   This brings
F15 1840 us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in
F15 1850 the field of civil legislation, but in the realm of conscience and religion:
F15 1860 They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief.
F15 1870 Conscience and religion are concerned with private <sin:> The civil
F15 1880 law is concerned with public <crimes>. Only confusion, failure
F15 1890 and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority
F15 1900 the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the
F15 1910 possibility of sin. Among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived
F15 1920 imposition would be religion itself.
F16 0010 ## On April 17, 1610, the sturdy little three-masted bark, <Discovery>,
F16 0020 weighed anchor in St& Katherine's Pool, London, and
F16 0030 floated down the Thames toward the sea. She carried, besides her captain,
F16 0040 a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration
F16 0050 of the Arctic waters of North America.   Seventeen months later,
F16 0060 on September 6, 1611, an Irish fishing boat sighted the <Discovery>
F16 0070 limping eastward outside Galway Bay. When she reached port,
F16 0080 she was found to have on board only eight men, all near starvation. The
F16 0090 captain was gone, and the mate was gone. The man who now commanded
F16 0100 her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman.   What disaster
F16 0110 struck the <Discovery> during those seventeen months? What happened
F16 0120 to the fourteen missing men? These questions have remained
F16 0130 one of the great sea mysteries of all time. For hundreds of years, the
F16 0140 evidence available consisted of (1) the captain's fragmentary journal,
F16 0150 (2) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors, (3) a note
F16 0160 found in a dead man's desk on board, and (4) several second-hand
F16 0170 reports. All told, they offered a highly confused picture.   But
F16 0180 since 1927, researchers digging into ancient court records and legal
F16 0190 files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information. Not
F16 0200 enough to do away with all doubts, but sufficient to give a fairly accurate
F16 0210 picture of the events of the voyage.   Historians have had
F16 0220 two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations. First,
F16 0230 they wanted to clarify a tantalizing, bizarre enigma. Second, they believed
F16 0240 it important to determine the fate of the captain- a man whose
F16 0250 name is permanently stamped on our maps, on American towns and counties,
F16 0260 on a great American river, and on half a million square miles
F16 0270 of Arctic seas.   The name: <Henry Hudson>.   This
F16 0280 is the story of his last tragic voyage, as nearly as we are able- or
F16 0290 ever, probably, will be able- to determine:   The sailing in
F16 0300 the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth in four years. Each time
F16 0310 his objective had been the same- a direct water passage from Western
F16 0320 Europe to the Far East. In 1607 and 1608, the English Muscovy
F16 0330 Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole
F16 0340 or across the top of Russia. Twice he had failed, and the Muscovy
F16 0350 Company indicated it would not back him again.   In 1609, the
F16 0360 Dutch East India Company hired Hudson, gave him two learned geographers,
F16 0370 fitted him out with a ship called the <Half Moon>, and supplied
F16 0380 him with Dutch sailors. This time he turned westward, to the
F16 0390 middle Atlantic coast of North America. His chief discovery was important-
F16 0400 the Great North (later, the Hudson) River- but it produced
F16 0410 no northwest passage. ## When the <Half Moon> put in at
F16 0420 Dartmouth, England, in the fall of 1609, word of Hudson's findings
F16 0430 leaked out, and English interest in him revived. The government
F16 0440 forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship. He thereupon went
F16 0450 to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth. By springtime,
F16 0460 he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage
F16 0470 of Henry, Prince of Wales. He had obtained and provisioned a veteran
F16 0480 ship called the <Discovery> and had recruited a crew of twenty-one,
F16 0490 the largest he had ever commanded.   The purpose of this
F16 0500 fourth voyage was clear. A century of exploration had established that
F16 0510 a great land mass, North and South America, lay between Europe
F16 0515 and
F16 0520 the Indies. One by one, the openings in the coast that promised a
F16 0530 passage through had been explored and discarded. In fact, Hudson's
F16 0540 sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes.
F16 0550    But there remained one mysterious, unexplored gap, far to
F16 0560 the north. Nearly twenty-five years before, Captain John Davis had
F16 0570 noted, as he sailed near the Arctic Circle, "a very great gulf, the
F16 0580 water whirling and roaring, as it were the meeting of tides". He
F16 0590 named this opening, between Baffin Island and Labrador, the "Furious
F16 0600 Overfall". (Later, it was to be called Hudson Strait.)
F16 0610    In 1602, George Waymouth, in the same little <Discovery> that
F16 0620 Hudson now commanded, had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his
F16 0630 frightened men turned the ship back. Hudson now proposed to sail all
F16 0635 the
F16 0640 way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway.
F16 0650    Even Hudson, experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he
F16 0660 was, must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames. Ahead were perilous,
F16 0670 ice-filled waters. On previous voyages, it had been in precisely
F16 0680 such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain.
F16 0690 On the second voyage, he had turned back at the frozen island of
F16 0700 Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that
F16 0710 he did so of his own free will- which was obviously not the case. On
F16 0720 the third voyage, a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch
F16 0730 and English crew members on the <Half Moon> had almost forced him
F16 0740 to head the ship back to Amsterdam in mid-Atlantic.   Worse,
F16 0750 his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before. Of
F16 0760 only one could he be sure- young John Hudson, his second son. The
F16 0770 mate, Robert Juet, who had kept the journal on the <half Moon>,
F16 0780 was experienced- but he was a bitter old man, ready to complain or
F16 0790 desert at any opportunity. Philip Staffe, the ship's carpenter, was
F16 0800 a good worker, but perversely independent. Arnold Lodley and Michael
F16 0810 Perse were like the rest- lukewarm, ready to swing against Hudson
F16 0820 in a crisis.   But men willing to sail at all into waters where
F16 0830 wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find. Hudson
F16 0840 knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer. And
F16 0850 he refused to be anything else.   It is believed that Hudson
F16 0860 was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was
F16 0865 trained
F16 0870 on company ships. He was a Londoner, married, with three sons.
F16 0880 (The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name
F16 0890 was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage.) In 1610,
F16 0900 Hudson was probably in his early forties, a good navigator, a stubborn
F16 0910 voyager, but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession.
F16 0920 ## Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a
F16 0930 few miles down the Thames. There at the river's edge waited one Henry
F16 0940 Greene, whom Hudson listed as a "clerk". Greene was in actuality
F16 0950 a young ruffian from Kent, who had broken with his parents in
F16 0960 order to keep the company he preferred- pimps, panders and whores.
F16 0970 He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board
F16 0980 and he had Greene wait at Gravesend, where the <Discovery> picked
F16 0990 him up.   For the first three weeks, the ship skirted up the
F16 1000 east coast of Great Britain, then turned westward. On May 11, she
F16 1010 reached Iceland. Poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the
F16 1020 crew called "Lousie Bay". The subsequent two-weeks wait made the
F16 1030 crew quarrelsome. With Hudson looking on, his protege Greene picked
F16 1040 a fight with the ship's surgeon, Edward Wilson. The issue was
F16 1050 settled on shore, Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore, determined
F16 1060 to catch the next fishing boat back to England. With difficulty,
F16 1070 Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship, and they sailed from Iceland.
F16 1080 ## Early in June, the <Discovery> passed "Desolation"
F16 1090 (southern Greenland) and in mid-June entered the "Furious Overfall".
F16 1100 Floating ice bore down from the north and west. Fog hung
F16 1110 over the route constantly. Turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet.
F16 1120 The ship's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic
F16 1130 North Pole.   As the bergs grew larger, Hudson was
F16 1140 forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay, an inlet of the
F16 1150 great strait. After finding that its coasts led nowhere, however, he
F16 1160 turned north again, toward the main, ice-filled passageway- and the
F16 1170 crew, at first uneasy, then frightened, rebelled.   The trouble
F16 1180 was at least partly Juet's doing. For weeks he had been saying that
F16 1190 Hudson's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd. The great,
F16 1200 crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice
F16 1210 of pure reason. A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would
F16 1220 sail no farther.   Instead of quelling the dissension, as many
F16 1230 captains of the era would have done (Sir Francis Drake lopped a man's
F16 1240 head off under similar circumstances), Hudson decided to be reasonable.
F16 1250 He went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart, which
F16 1260 he set up in view of the crew. Patiently, he explained what he knew
F16 1270 about their course and their objectives.   When Hudson had finished,
F16 1280 the "town meeting" broke down into a general, wordy
F16 1285 argument.
F16 1290 One man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds, he would give ninety
F16 1300 of them to be back in England. Up spoke carpenter Staffe, who
F16 1310 said he wouldn't give <ten> pounds to be home. The statement was
F16 1320 effective. The meeting broke up. Hudson was free to sail on. ##
F16 1330 All through July the <Discovery> picked her way along the 450-mile-long
F16 1340 strait, avoiding ice and rocky islands. On August 3, two massive
F16 1350 headlands reared out of the mists- great gateways never before,
F16 1360 so far as Hudson knew, seen by Europeans. To starboard was a cape
F16 1370 a thousand feet high, patched with ice and snow, populated by thousands
F16 1380 of screaming sea birds. To port was a point 200 feet high rising behind
F16 1390 to a precipice of 2,000 feet. Hudson named the capes Digges and
F16 1400 Wolstenholme, for two of his backers.   Hudson pointed the <Discovery>
F16 1410 down the east coast of the newly discovered sea (now called
F16 1420 Hudson Bay), confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the
F16 1430 Pacific. After three weeks' swift sailing, however, the ship entered
F16 1440 an area of shallow marshes and river deltas. The ship halted. The
F16 1450 great "sea to the westwards" was a dead end.   This must have
F16 1460 been Hudson's blackest discovery. For he seemed to sense at once
F16 1470 that before him was no South Sea, but the solid bulk of the North
F16 1480 American continent. This was the bitter end, and Hudson seemed to
F16 1490 know he was destined to failure.   Feverishly, he tried to brush
F16 1500 away this intuition. North and south, east and west, back and forth
F16 1510 he sailed in the land-locked bay, plowing furiously forward until land
F16 1520 appeared, then turning to repeat the process, day after day, week after
F16 1530 week. Hundreds of miles to the north, the route back to England
F16 1540 through the "Furious Overfall" was again filling with ice.
F16 1550    The men were at first puzzled, then angered by the aimless tacking.
F16 1560 Once more, Juet's complaints were the loudest. Hudson's reply
F16 1570 was to accuse the mate of disloyalty. Juet demanded that Hudson prove
F16 1580 his charges in an open trial.   The trial was held September
F16 1590 10. Hudson, presiding, heard Juet's defense, then called for testimony
F16 1600 from crew members. Juet had made plentiful enemies, several men
F16 1610 stepped forward. Hands on Bible, seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe
F16 1620 swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords
F16 1630 in their cabins. Cook Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted
F16 1640 bloodshed on the ship. Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the
F16 1650 ship homeward.   Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay. The new
F16 1660 mate was Robert Bylot, talented but inexperienced. There were other
F16 1670 shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves.
F16 1680 The important result, however, was that Juet and Francis
F16 1690 Clemens, the deposed boatswain, became Hudson's sworn enemies.
F16 1700    As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little
F16 1710 bay, every incident lessened the crew's respect for him. Once,
F16 1720 after the <Discovery> lay for a week in rough weather, Hudson ordered
F16 1730 the anchor raised before the sea had calmed. Just as it was being
F16 1740 hauled inboard, a sea hit the ship. Michael Butt and Adame Moore
F16 1750 were thrown off the capstan and badly injured. The anchor cable would
F16 1760 have been lost overboard, but Philip Staffe was on hand to sever
F16 1770 it with his axe.
F17 0010    Thomas Douglas, fifth Earl of Selkirk, a noble humanitarian
F17 0020 Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands,
F17 0030 conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red River
F17 0040 of the North. Since the land he desired lay within the great northern
F17 0050 empire of the Hudson's Bay Company, he purchased great blocks of
F17 0060 the Comany's stock with the view to controlling its policies. Having
F17 0070 achieved this end, he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the
F17 0080 valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. The grant, which stretched
F17 0090 southward to Lake Traverse- the headwaters of the Red- was
F17 0100 made in May, 1811, and by October of that year a small group of Scots
F17 0110 was settling for the winter at York Factory on Hudson Bay. Thus
F17 0120 at the same time that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify
F17 0130 the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame at the battle
F17 0140 of Tippecanoe, Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the
F17 0150 center of the North American continent to the west of the American
F17 0160 agricultural frontier.   Seven hundred miles south of York Factory,
F17 0170 at "the Forks" of the Red and the Assiniboine, twenty-three
F17 0180 men located a settlement in August 1812. By October the little
F17 0190 colony about Fort Douglas (present-day Winnipeg) numbered 100. Within
F17 0200 a few years the Scots, engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring
F17 0210 the rich soil of the valley, were joined by a group called <Meurons>.
F17 0220 The latter, members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported
F17 0230 by Great Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the
F17 0240 War of 1812, had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of
F17 0250 the war in 1815. Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go
F17 0260 to Red River where they were to serve as a military force to protect
F17 0270 his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the
F17 0280 intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire. The mercenaries
F17 0290 were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of
F17 0300 the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as
F17 0310 1818.   It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages
F17 0320 of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement
F17 0330 southward. When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was
F17 0340 assessed, all but fifty of the Scots, Swiss and <metis> moved up
F17 0350 the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river. Here they built huts and
F17 0360 a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland.
F17 0370 The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer
F17 0380 to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for
F17 0390 food.   The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move
F17 0400 southward by British fur traders. For many years the Northwest Company
F17 0410 had its southern headquarters at Prairie du Chien on the Mississippi
F17 0420 River, some 300 miles southeast of present-day St& Paul,
F17 0430 Minnesota. When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm
F17 0440 out of the United States, its British-born employees, now become American
F17 0450 citizens- Joseph Rolette, Joseph Renville and Alexis Bailly-
F17 0460 continued in the fur business. On Big Stone Lake near the
F17 0470 headwaters of the Red River, Robert Dickson, Superintendent of
F17 0480 the Western Indian Department of Canada, had a trading post and planned
F17 0490 in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small
F17 0500 artillery pieces. His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks
F17 0510 of Red River and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south
F17 0520 in carts. These carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days
F17 0530 of Alexander Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk
F17 0540 colony was begun. In 1802 Henry referred to "our new carts" as
F17 0550 being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as
F17 0560 a horse could pack. They were held together by pegs and withes and
F17 0570 in later times drawn by a single ox in thills.   It was Dickson
F17 0580 who suggested to Lord Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast
F17 0590 by way of the United States. In September 1817 at Fort Daer (Pembina)
F17 0600 Dickson met the noble lord whom, with the help of a band of Sioux,
F17 0610 he escorted to Prairie du Chien. During the trip Selkirk decided
F17 0620 that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern
F17 0630 United States was the best route for goods from England to reach
F17 0640 Red River and that the United States was a better source of supply
F17 0650 for many goods than either Canada or England. Upon arriving at
F17 0660 Baltimore, Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John Quincy Adams,
F17 0670 Secretary of State at Washington, inquiring about laws covering trade
F17 0680 with "Missouri and Illinois Territories". This traffic, he
F17 0690 declared prophetically, "tho' it might be of small account at first,
F17 0700 would increase with the progress of our Settlements **h".
F17 0710 The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop
F17 0720 into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might
F17 0730 have expected. In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at "the
F17 0740 Forks" (Fort Douglas) and in December 1819, twenty men left Fort
F17 0750 Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie du Chien.
F17 0760 It was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three
F17 0770 months of labor on Mackinac boats. With these completed and ice
F17 0780 gone from the St& Peter's River (present-day Minnesota river)
F17 0790 their 250 bushels of wheat, 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels
F17 0800 of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats
F17 0810 and rowed up the river to Big Stone Lake, across into Lake Traverse,
F17 0820 and down the Red. They reached Fort Douglas in June 1820. This
F17 0830 epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk @1,040.
F17 0840 Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were
F17 0850 forced to retreat to Fort Daer for food. Thereafter seed and food became
F17 0860 more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round.
F17 0870    Activity by British traders and the presence of a colony
F17 0880 on the Red prompted the United State War Department in 1819 to send
F17 0890 Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post
F17 0900 300 miles northwest of Prairie du Chien, until then the most advanced
F17 0910 United States post. In September 1822 two companies of infantry
F17 0920 arrived at the mouth of the St& Peter's River, the head of navigation
F17 0930 on the Mississippi, and began construction of Fort St&
F17 0940 Anthony which, upon completion, was renamed in honor of its commander,
F17 0950 Colonel Josiah Snelling.   It was from the American outposts
F17 0960 that Red River shortages of livestock were to be made good. Hercules
F17 0970 L& Dousman, fur trader and merchant at Prairie du Chien, contracted
F17 0980 to supply Selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle, and
F17 0990 Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe were hired as drovers. Bailly,
F17 1000 after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821, was forced to leave
F17 1010 some of the cattle at the Hudson's Bay Company's post on Lake
F17 1020 Traverse "in the Sieux Country" and reached Fort Garry, as the
F17 1030 Selkirk Hudson's Bay Company center was now called, late in the
F17 1040 fall. He set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families
F17 1050 of discontented and disappointed Swiss who turned their eyes toward
F17 1060 the United States. Observing their distressing condition, Colonel
F17 1070 Snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military
F17 1080 reservation.   As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk
F17 1090 settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota, Dousman
F17 1100 of Michilimackinac, Michigan, and Prairie du Chien was traveling
F17 1110 to Red River to open a trade in merchandise. Early in 1822 he was
F17 1120 at Fort Garry offering to bring in pork, flour, liquor and tobacco.
F17 1130 Alexander McDonnell, governor of Red River, and James Bird,
F17 1140 a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, ordered such "sundry
F17 1150 articles" to a value of @4,500.   For its part the Hudson's
F17 1160 Bay Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement.
F17 1170 As the time drew near for the drawing of the British-American frontier
F17 1180 by terms of the agreement of 1818, the company suspected that the
F17 1190 Pembina colony- its own post and Fort Daer- was on American
F17 1200 territory. Accordingly Selkirk's agents ordered the settlers to move
F17 1210 north, and by October, John Halkett had torn down both posts, floating
F17 1220 the timber to "the Forks" in rafts. "I have done everything",
F17 1230 he wrote, "to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment
F17 1240 **h". Despite Company threats, duly carried through, to cut
F17 1250 off supplies of powder, ball, and thread for fishing nets, about 350
F17 1260 persons stayed in the village. They would attempt to bring supplies
F17 1270 from St& Louis or Prairie du Chien at "great expense as well
F17 1280 as danger".   At Fort Garry some of the Swiss also decided
F17 1290 to cast their lot with the United States, and in 1823 several families
F17 1300 paid guides to take them to Fort Snelling. The disasters of 1825-1826
F17 1310 caused more to leave. After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice,
F17 1320 snow fell on October 15, 1825, and remained on the ground through
F17 1330 a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick. In April
F17 1340 came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until
F17 1350 mid-June. On June 24 more than 400 families started the three-month
F17 1360 trip across the plains to the Mississippi. By fall, 443 survivors
F17 1370 of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling, but
F17 1380 most of them were sent on to Galena and St& Louis, with a few going
F17 1390 as far as Vevay, Indiana, a notable Swiss center in the United
F17 1400 States. In 1837, 157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were
F17 1410 living on the reservation at Fort Snelling.   Below the fort,
F17 1420 high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi
F17 1430 River. At the point where they ended, another settlement grew
F17 1440 up around a chapel built at the boat landing by Father Lucian Galtier
F17 1450 in 1840. Its people, including Pierre Bottineau and other American
F17 1460 Fur Company employees and the refugees from Fort Garry, were
F17 1470 joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort Snelling when Major
F17 1480 Joseph Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840.
F17 1490 The resultant town, platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father
F17 1500 Galtier's mission, St& Paul, was to become an important center
F17 1510 of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those Selkirkers
F17 1520 who remained at Red River.   While population at Fort
F17 1530 Garry increased rapidly, from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840, economic
F17 1540 opportunities did not increase at a similar rate. Accordingly, though
F17 1550 the practice violated the no-trading provision of the Selkirk charter
F17 1560 which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the
F17 1570 Hudson's Bay Company, some settlers went into trade. The Company
F17 1580 maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased
F17 1590 and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they
F17 1600 refrain from trading in furs. Despite this prohibiton, by 1844 some
F17 1610 of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs.
F17 1620 In June 1845, the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed
F17 1630 a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson's Bay which were viewed
F17 1640 as aimed at the "very vitals of the Company's trade and power".
F17 1650 To reduce further the flow of goods from England, the Company's
F17 1660 local officials asked that its London authorities refrain from forwarding
F17 1670 any more trade goods to these men.   With their customary source
F17 1680 of supply cut off, the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men
F17 1690 to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country. Others carried
F17 1700 pemmican from "the Forks" to St& Paul and goods from St&
F17 1710 Paul to Red River, as in the summer of 1847 when one trader, Wells,
F17 1720 transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement. This
F17 1730 trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per cent after February 1835,
F17 1740 but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty
F17 1750 was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the London committee.
F17 1760    The trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow
F17 1770 in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel.
F18 0010 The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor. Indeed, no richer
F18 0020 humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in
F18 0030 the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray. Some
F18 0040 of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive. A Confederate
F18 0050 observed that the Yankees were: "thicker than lise on a hen
F18 0060 and a dam site ornraier". Another reported that his comrades were
F18 0070 "in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house".
F18 0080 A third wrote that it was "raining like poring peas on a rawhide".
F18 0090    Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression. One
F18 0100 wrote: "[I am so hungry] I could eat a rider off his horse +
F18 0110 snap at the stirups". A second reported that the dilapidated houses
F18 0120 in Virginia "look like the latter end of original sin and hard times".
F18 0130 A third remarked of slowness of Southerners: "They moved
F18 0140 about from corner to corner, as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches
F18 0150 on the neck of a wooden god". Still another, annoyed by the brevity
F18 0160 of a recently received missive, wrote: "Yore letter was short and
F18 0170 sweet, jist like a roasted maget". A Yankee sergeant gave the following
F18 0180 description of his sweetheart: "My girl is none of your one-horse
F18 0190 girls. She is a regular stub and twister, double geered. **h
F18 0200 She is well-educated and refined, all wildcat and fur, and Union from
F18 0210 the muzzle to the crupper".   Humor found many modes of expression.
F18 0220 A Texan wrote to a male companion at home: "What has become
F18 0230 of Halda and Laura? **h When you see them again give them my
F18 0240 love- not best respects now, but love by God". William R& Stillwell,
F18 0250 an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved
F18 0260 in the Georgia Department of Archives and History, liked
F18 0270 to
F18 0280 tease his wife in his letters. After he had been away from home about
F18 0290 a year he wrote: "[Dear Wife] If I did not write and receive
F18 0300 letters from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married
F18 0310 I don't feel much like a maryed man but I never forgit it sofar
F18 0320 as to court enny other lady but if I should you must forgive me as
F18 0330 I am
F18 0340 so forgitful". A Yank, disturbed by his increasing corpulence, wrote:
F18 0350 "I am growing so fat **h I am a burden 2 myself". Another
F18 0360 Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer: "Now I lay me down
F18 0370 to sleep, The gray-backs o'er my body creep; If they should bite
F18 0380 before I wake, I pray the Lord their jaws to break"".
F18 0385 Charles
F18 0390 Thiot, a splendid Georgia soldier, differed from most of his
F18 0400 comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation,
F18 0410 well-educated, and nearly fifty years of age. But he was very much like
F18 0420 his associates in his hatred of camp routine. Near the end of his
F18 0430 service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups,
F18 0440 name one of them "fall-in" and the other "close-up", and
F18 0450 then shoot them both, "and that will be the end of 'fall-in' and
F18 0460 'close-up'".   The soldiers who comprised the rank and file
F18 0470 of the Civil War armies were an earthy people. They talked and
F18 0480 wrote much about the elemental functions of the body. One of the most
F18 0490 common of camp maladies was diarrhoea. Men of more delicate sensibilities
F18 0500 referred to this condition as "looseness of the bowels"; but
F18 0510 a much more common designation was "the sh-ts". A Michigan soldier
F18 0520 stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864: "I expect to be tough
F18 0530 as a knott as soon as I get over the Georgia Shitts". Johnny Rebs
F18 0540 from the deep South who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer
F18 0550 to the Virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering
F18 0560 from the "the Virginia quickstep".   A Georgia soldier
F18 0570 gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence
F18 0580 of diarrhoea: "I have bin a little sick with diorah two or three
F18 0590 days **h. I eat too much eggs and poark it sowered [on] my stomack
F18 0600 and turn loose on me". A Michigan soldier wrote his brother:
F18 0610 "I am well at present with the exception I have got the Dyerear
F18 0620 and I hope thease few lines find you the same".   The letters
F18 0630 which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances.
F18 0640 Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters, soldiers
F18 0650 rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table. Most of
F18 0660 the letters were written in the hubbub of camp, on stumps, pieces of
F18 0670 bark, drum heads, or the knee. In the South, after the first year of
F18 0680 the war, paper and ink were very poor. Scarcity of paper caused many
F18 0690 Southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing, i&e&, after writing
F18 0700 from left to right of the page in the usual manner, they gave the
F18 0710 sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously
F18 0720 written. Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing
F18 0730 about their heads. A Yank writing from Vicksburg, May 28, 1863,
F18 0740 stated "Not less than 50 balls have passed over me since I commenced
F18 0750 writing **h. I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes, but we
F18 0760 take no notice of them now". A Reb stationed near Petersburg informed
F18 0770 his mother: "I need not tell you that I dodge pretty often
F18 0780 **h for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter. Just
F18 0790 count each blot a dodge and add in a few for I don't dodge every
F18 0800 time". Another Reb writing under similar circumstances before Atlanta
F18 0810 reported: "The Yankees keep Shooting so I am afraid they
F18 0820 will knock over my ink, so I will close". #/3,# The most
F18 0830 common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives. But
F18 0840 fathers often addressed communications to their small children; and
F18 0850 these, full of homely advice, are among the most human and revealing
F18 0860 of Civil War letters. Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include
F18 0870 in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro
F18 0880 community. Occasionally they would write to the slaves. Early in the
F18 0890 war it was not uncommon for planters' sons to retain in camp Negro
F18 0900 "body servants" to perform the menial chores such as cooking, foraging,
F18 0910 cleaning the quarters, shining shoes, and laundering clothes.
F18 0920 Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters
F18 0930 of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members
F18 0940 of their owners' families.   Unmarried soldiers carried on
F18 0950 correspondence with sweethearts at home. Owing to the restrained usages
F18 0960 characteristic of 19th-century America, these letters usually were
F18 0970 stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling.   Occasionally
F18 0980 gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about
F18 0990 their amorous exploits in Richmond, Petersburg, Washington, or
F18 1000 Nashville. But these comments are hardly printable. An Alabama soldier
F18 1010 whose
F18 1020 feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully
F18 1030 of his achievements among the Virginia belles: "They thout
F18 1040 I was a saint. I told them some sweet lies and they believed it
F18 1050 all **h I would tell them I got a letter from home stating that five
F18 1060 of my Negroes had runaway and ten of Pappies But I wold say I
F18 1070 recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they
F18 1080 would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk".
F18 1090 Some of the letters were pungently expressive. An Ohio soldier who,
F18 1100 from a comrade just returned from leave, received an unfavorable comment
F18 1110 on the conduct of his sister, took pen in hand and delivered himself
F18 1120 thus: "[Dear Sis] Alf sed he heard that you and hardy was
F18 1130 a runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having
F18 1140 any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no more yuse **h.
F18 1150 I think you made a dam good chouise to turn off as nise a feler as Alf
F18 1160 dyer and let that orney thefin, drunkard, damed card playing Sun
F18 1170 of a bich com to Sea you, the god damed theaf and lop yeard pigen tode
F18 1180 helion, he is too orney for hel **h. i will Shute him as shore as
F18 1190 i Sea him".   Initiation into combat sometimes elicited from
F18 1200 soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions.
F18 1210 A Federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his
F18 1220 first skirmish in Virginia: "Dear Pa **h. Went out a Skouting
F18 1230 yesterday. We got to one house where there were five secessionist they
F18 1240 brok + run and Arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns of biches
F18 1250 and we all let go at them. Thay may say what they please but godamit
F18 1260 Pa it is fun".   Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers
F18 1270 in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers. A Mississippi
F18 1280 soldier wrote: "Our General Reub Davis **h is a vain,
F18 1290 stuck-up, illiterate ass". An Alabamian wrote: "Col& Henry
F18 1300 is [an ignoramus] fit for nothing higher than the cultivation
F18 1310 of corn". A Floridian stated that his officers were "not fit to
F18 1320 tote guts to a bear". On December 9, 1862, Sergeant Edwin H&
F18 1330 Fay, an unusual Louisianan who held A&B& and M&A& degrees
F18 1340 from Harvard University and who before the war was headmaster of a
F18 1350 private school for boys in Louisiana, wrote his wife: "I saw Pemberton
F18 1360 and he is the most insignificant puke I ever saw **h. His head
F18 1370 cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment, much less a corps
F18 1380 **h. Jackson **h runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow
F18 1390 their leader. He is not worth shucks. But he is a West Point
F18 1400 graduate and therefore must be born to command".   Similar comments
F18 1410 about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers.
F18 1420 A Massachusetts soldier, who seems to have been a Civil War
F18 1430 version of Bill Mauldin, wrote: "The officers consider themselves
F18 1440 as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks
F18 1450 **h. They get all the glory and most of the pay and don't earn ten
F18 1460 cents apiece on the average, the drunken rascals". Private George
F18 1470 Gray Hunter of Pennsylvania wrote: "I am well convinced in My
F18 1480 own Mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended
F18 1490 long ago". Another Yankee became so disgusted as to state: "I
F18 1500 wish to God one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging
F18 1510 them against [the other half]".   No group of officers
F18 1520 came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors. One Federal
F18 1530 soldier wrote: "The docters is no a conte **h hell will be filde
F18 1540 with do[c]ters and offersey when this war is over". Shortly after
F18 1550 the beginning of Sherman's Georgia campaign, an ailing Yank
F18 1560 wrote his homefolk: "The surgeon insisted on Sending me to the hospital
F18 1570 for treatment. I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed-
F18 1580 thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than [by] Union
F18 1590 quackery".   The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward
F18 1600 each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut
F18 1610 of feeling, from friendliness to extreme hatred. The Rebs were, to
F18 1620 a Massachusetts corporal, "fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey
F18 1630 + gunpowder put into a human frame". A Pennsylvania soldier
F18 1640 wrote that "they were the hardest looking set of men that Ever i saw
F18 1650 they Looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings **h".
F18 1660 Private Jenkins Lloyd Jones of the Wisconsin Light Artillery wrote
F18 1670 in his diary: "I strolled among the Alabamans on the right
F18 1680 **h found some of the greenest specimens of humanity I think in the universe
F18 1690 their ignorance being little less than the slave they despise
F18 1700 with as imperfect a dialect 'They Recooned as how you'uns all would
F18 1710 be a heap wus to we'uns all'". In a similar vein, but writing
F18 1720 from the opposite side, Thomas Taylor, a private in the 6th Alabama
F18 1730 Volunteers, in a letter to his wife, stated: "You know that
F18 1740 my heart is with you but I never could have been satisfied to have staid
F18 1750 at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe By a set of
F18 1760 cowardly Skunks whose Motto is Booty **h.
F19 0010 THE POPULARITY OF FOLKLORE IN AMERICA STANDS IN DIRECT PROPORTION
F19 0020 to the popularity of nationalism in America. And the emphasis on nationalism
F19 0030 in America is in proportion to the growth of American influence
F19 0040 across the world. Thus, if we are to observe American folklore
F19 0050 in the twentieth century, we will do well to establish the relationships
F19 0060 between folklore, nationalism and imperialism at the outset.
F19 0070    Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism
F19 0080 and international influence. 1) Every age rewrites the events
F19 0090 of its history in terms of what should have been, creating legends
F19 0100 about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary
F19 0110 actions. What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important
F19 0120 as what a given generation feels must have occurred. 2) As a country
F19 0130 superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others, it searches
F19 0140 its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness. Its folklore
F19 0150 and legend, usually disguised as history, are allowed to account
F19 0160 for group actions, to provide a focal point for group loyalty, and to
F19 0170 become a cohesive force for national identification.   One can apply
F19 0180 these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
F19 0190 as she spread her dominion over palm and pine, and they can be
F19 0200 applied again to the United States in more recent years. The popularity
F19 0210 of local color literature before the Spanish-American War, the
F19 0220 steady currency of the Lincoln myth, the increased emphasis on the
F19 0230 frontier west in our mass media are cases in point. Nor is it an accident
F19 0240 that baseball, growing into the national game in the last 75 years,
F19 0250 has become a microcosm of American life, that learned societies such
F19 0260 as the American Folklore Society and the American Historical
F19 0270 Association were founded in the 1880s, or that courses in American literature,
F19 0280 American civilization, American anything have swept our school
F19 0290 and college curricula.   Of course, nationalism has really
F19 0300 outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours, and its
F19 0310 continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the
F19 0315 twentieth-century
F19 0320 United States. Yet nationalism has lost few of its
F19 0330 charms for the historian, writer or man in the street. It is an understandable
F19 0340 paradox that most American history and most American literature
F19 0350 is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic
F19 0360 point of view at the very time America is spreading her dominion
F19 0370 over palm and pine. After all, the average American as he lies and
F19 0380 waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain
F19 0390 hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or
F19 0400 her plight is the result of a complex of personal, economic and governmental
F19 0410 actions far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control.
F19 0420 Anyone's identification with an international struggle, whether
F19 0430 warlike or peaceful, requires absurd oversimplification and intense
F19 0440 emotional involvement. Such identification comes for each group in each
F19 0450 crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate
F19 0460 national heroes.   In America, such self-deception has served
F19 0470 a particularly useful purpose. A heterogeneous people have needed it
F19 0480 to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and
F19 0485 ever-changing
F19 0490 land. But we must never forget, most of the appropriate
F19 0500 heroes and their legends were created overnight, to answer immediate needs,
F19 0510 almost always with conscious aims and ends. Parson Weems's George
F19 0520 Washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of
F19 0530 the uniting States. Abraham Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of
F19 0540 the national Constitution. Robert E& Lee represented the dignity
F19 0550 needed by a rebelling confederacy. And their roles are paralleled by
F19 0560 those of Patrick Henry, Nathan Hale, Andrew Jackson, Davy Crockett,
F19 0570 Theodore Roosevelt and many, many more.   Therefore, the
F19 0580 scholar, as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years,
F19 0590 will be mindful of two facts. 1) Most of the legends that are created
F19 0600 to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are
F19 0610 not folk legends at all. 2) The concept that an "American national
F19 0620 folklore" exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend.
F19 0630    Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group
F19 0640 of people preserve, vary and recreate through oral transmission. It
F19 0650 has come to mean myths, legends, tales, songs, proverbs, riddles, superstitions,
F19 0660 rhymes and such literary forms of expression. Related to
F19 0670 written literature, and often remaining temporarily frozen in written
F19 0680 form, it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral
F19 0690 existence. Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies,
F19 0700 it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter.
F19 0710    In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our
F19 0720 folk heritage, the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as
F19 0730 this. Enthusiastically, Americans have swept subliterary and bogus
F19 0740 materials like Paul Bunyan tales, Abe Lincoln anecdotes and labor
F19 0750 union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition. Nor
F19 0760 have we remembered that in the melting pot of America the hundreds of
F19 0770 isolated and semi-isolated ethnic, regional and occupational groups did
F19 0780 not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education
F19 0785 and industrialization
F19 0790 had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as
F19 0800 a means of carrying culturally significant material.   Naturally,
F19 0810 such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make
F19 0820 money or fan patriotism by means of folklore. That much of what he
F19 0830 calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people
F19 0840 with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction
F19 0850 to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant. As long
F19 0860 as his material is Americana, can in some way be ascribed to the masses
F19 0870 and appears "democratic" to his audience, he remains satisfied.
F19 0880    From all this we can now see that two streams of development
F19 0890 run through the history of twentieth-century American folklore. On
F19 0900 the one side we have the university professors and their students, trained
F19 0910 in Teutonic methods of research, who have sought out, collected
F19 0920 and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic,
F19 0930 regional and occupational groups that make up this nation. On the other
F19 0940 we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been
F19 0950 willing to use any patriotic, "frontier western" or colonial material
F19 0960 willy-nilly. Unfortunately, few of the artists (writers, movie
F19 0970 producers, dramatists and musicians) who have used American folklore
F19 0980 since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams
F19 0990 even in the most general of ways. After all, the field is large, difficult
F19 1000 to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates.
F19 1010 In addition, this country has been settled by many peoples of many
F19 1020 heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly, in an age of
F19 1030 print and easy communication, within an ever-expanding and changing society.
F19 1040 The problems confuse even the experts.   For that matter,
F19 1050 the experts themselves are a mixed breed. Anthropologists, housewives,
F19 1060 historians and such by profession, they approach their discipline
F19 1070 as amateurs, collectors, commercial propagandists, analysts or some combination
F19 1080 of the four. They have widely varying backgrounds and aims.
F19 1090 They have little "esprit de corps".   The outlook for the
F19 1100 amateur, for instance, is usually dependent on his fondness for local
F19 1110 history or for the picturesque. His love of folklore has romanticism
F19 1120 in it, and he doesn't care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote.
F19 1130 Folklore is his hobby, and he, all too rightly, wishes it to remain
F19 1140 as such. The amateur is closely related to the collector, who is
F19 1150 actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field. The collector
F19 1160 enjoys the contact with rural life; he hunts folklore for the
F19 1170 very "field and stream" reasons that many persons hunt game; and
F19 1180 only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has
F19 1190 located. Fundamentally, both these types, the amateur and the collector,
F19 1200 are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish well between
F19 1210 real folklore and bogus material.   But there are also the commercial
F19 1220 propagandists and the analysts- one dominated by money, the other
F19 1230 by nineteenth-century German scholarship. Both are primarily concerned
F19 1240 with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector
F19 1250 has found. Both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond
F19 1260 the sewage system and the electric light lines. The commercial propagandist,
F19 1270 who can't afford to be critical, gets along well with the
F19 1280 amateur, from whom he feeds, but he frequently steps on the analyst's
F19 1290 toes by refusing to keep his material genuine. His standards are,
F19 1300 of course, completely foreign to those of the analyst. To both the amateur
F19 1310 and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul, lacks appreciation
F19 1320 with his endless probings and classifications. Dominated by
F19 1330 the vicious circle of the university promotion system, the analyst looks
F19 1340 down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups, although
F19 1350 he cannot deny his debt to the collector.   The knowledge that
F19 1360 most Americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial
F19 1370 propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors. The work
F19 1380 done by the analysts, the men who really know what folklore is all about,
F19 1390 has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort
F19 1400 and reaches a limited, learned audience. Publishers want books that
F19 1410 will sell, recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to
F19 1420 ears used to hillbilly and jazz music, grade and high schools want quaint,
F19 1430 but moral, material. The analyst is apt to be too honest to fit
F19 1440 in. As a result, most people don't have more than a vague idea what
F19 1450 folklore actually is; they see it as a potpourri of charming, moral
F19 1460 legends and patriotic anecdotes, with a superstition or remedy thrown
F19 1470 in here and there. And so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur
F19 1480 and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the
F19 1490 hundred-odd folklore courses given in the United States survive on sentiment
F19 1500 and nationalism alone.   If one wishes to discuss a literary
F19 1510 figure who uses folklore in his work, the first thing he must realize
F19 1520 is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American
F19 1530 public. And while every writer must be dealt with as a special
F19 1540 case, the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions
F19 1550 about each. Does the writer know the difference between an "ersatz"
F19 1560 ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk? When
F19 1570 the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial
F19 1580 effect or does he leave it pure? Is the writer propagandistic?
F19 1590 Is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an America that was?
F19 1600 Or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of American
F19 1610 attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they
F19 1620 may be?   When he gets the answers to his questions he will be
F19 1630 discouraged. In the first place, a good many writers who are said to
F19 1640 use folklore, do not, unless one counts an occasional superstition or
F19 1650 tale. Robert Frost, for instance, writes about rural life in New England,
F19 1660 but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in
F19 1670 his poems. This has not, however, prevented publishers from labeling
F19 1680 him a "folk poet", simply because he is a rural one. In the second
F19 1690 place, a large number of writers, making a more direct claim than Frost
F19 1700 to being "folk writers" of one sort or another, clearly make
F19 1710 no distinctions between genuine and bogus material. Stephen Vincent
F19 1720 Benet's <John Brown's Body> comes immediately to mind in this
F19 1730 connection, as does John Steinbeck's <The Grapes of Wrath>
F19 1740 and Carl Sandburg's <The People, Yes>. The last two writers
F19 1760 introduce strong political bias into their works, and not unlike the union
F19 1770 leaders that we will discuss soon, see folklore as a reservoir of
F19 1780 protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass. Folklore, as
F19 1790 used by such writers, really reflects images engraved into it by the very
F19 1800 person using it. The folk are simply not homogeneous with respect
F19 1810 to nation or political attitude. In fact, there is much evidence to
F19 1820 indicate they don't care a bit about anything beyond their particular
F19 1830 regional, ethnic and occupational limits. Nevertheless, with a reading
F19 1840 public that longs for the "good old days" and with an awareness
F19 1850 of our expanding international interests, it is easy for the Benets
F19 1860 to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of
F19 1870 Americana, real or fake, and it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs
F19 1880 to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform
F19 1890 into the minds of the folk.
F20 0010 As part of the same arrangement, Torrio had, in the spirit of peace
F20 0020 and good will, and in exchange for armed support in the April election
F20 0030 campaign, bestowed upon O'Banion a third share in the Hawthorne
F20 0040 Smoke Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade. The coalition
F20 0050 was to prove inadvisable.   O'Banion was a complex and frightening
F20 0060 man, whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour
F20 0070 into others'. He had a round, frank Irish face, creased in a
F20 0080 jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets
F20 0090 into someone's body. He carried three guns- one in the right
F20 0100 trouser pocket, one under his left armpit, one in the left outside coat
F20 0110 pocket- and was equally lethal with both hands. He killed accurately,
F20 0120 freely, and dispassionately. The police credited him with twenty-five
F20 0130 murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them.
F20 0140 Like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol. He was an expert
F20 0150 florist, tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths.
F20 0160 He had no apparent comprehension of morality; he divided humanity
F20 0170 into "right guys" and "wrong guys", and the wrong ones he
F20 0180 was always willing to kill and trample under. He had what was described
F20 0190 by a psychologist as a "sunny brutality". He walked with a heavy
F20 0200 list to the right, as that leg was four inches shorter than the other,
F20 0210 but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns. Landesco
F20 0220 thought him "just a superior sort of plugugly" but he was,
F20 0230 in fact, with his aggression and hostility, and nerveless indifference
F20 0240 to risking or administering pain, a casebook psychopath. He was also
F20 0250 at this time, although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets
F20 0260 as Torrio and Capone, the most powerful and most dangerous mob
F20 0270 leader in the Chicago underworld, the roughneck king.   O'Banion
F20 0280 was born in poverty, the son of an immigrant Irish plasterer,
F20 0290 in the North Side's Little Hell, close by the Sicilian quarter
F20 0300 and Death Corner. He had been a choir boy at the Holy Name Cathedral
F20 0310 and also served as an acolyte to Father O'Brien. The influence
F20 0320 of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested, slum tenements
F20 0330 among the bawdy houses, honkytonks, and sawdust saloons of his birthplace;
F20 0340 he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood, and
F20 0350 went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving, police-dodging,
F20 0360 and housebreaking. At the age of ten, when he was working as
F20 0370 a newsboy in the Loop, he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted
F20 0380 in his permanently shortened leg. Because of this he was known as
F20 0390 Gimpy (but, as with Capone and his nickname of Scarface, never in
F20 0400 his presence). In his teens O'Banion was enrolled in the vicious
F20 0410 Market Street gang and he became a singing waiter in McGovern's
F20 0420 Cafe, a notoriously low and rowdy dive in North Clark Street, where
F20 0430 befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing
F20 0440 waiters before being thrown out. He then got a job with the Chicago
F20 0450 <Herald-Examiner> as a circulation slugger, a rough fighter
F20 0460 employed to see that his paper's news pitches were not trespassed upon
F20 0470 by rival vendors. He was also at the same time gaining practical
F20 0480 experience as a safe breaker and highwayman, and learning how to shoot
F20 0490 to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene Geary, later
F20 0500 committed to Chester Asylum as a homicidal maniac, but whose eyes
F20 0510 misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish
F20 0520 mother in his clear and syrupy tenor.   O'Banion's first conflict
F20 0530 with the police came in 1909, at seventeen, when he was committed
F20 0540 to Bridewell Prison for three months for burglary; two years
F20 0550 later he served another three months for assault. Those were his only
F20 0560 interludes behind bars, although he collected four more charges on his
F20 0570 police record in 1921 and 1922, three for burglary and one for robbery.
F20 0580 But by now O'Banion's political pull was beginning to be effective.
F20 0590 On the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10,000 bond was
F20 0600 furnished by an alderman, and the charge was <nolle prossed>. On one
F20 0610 of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a Detective Sergeant
F20 0620 John J& Ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour
F20 0630 office safe in the Postal Telegraph Building; the jury wanted
F20 0640 better evidence than that and he was acquitted, at a cost of $30,000
F20 0650 in bribes, it was estimated. As promptly as Torrio, O'Banion jumped
F20 0660 into bootlegging. He conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous
F20 0670 violence than the Sicilians, but he had his huge North Side
F20 0680 portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money. Unlike the
F20 0690 Sicilians, he additionally conducted holdups, robberies, and safe-cracking
F20 0700 expeditions, and refused to touch prostitution. He was also personally
F20 0710 active in ward politics, and by 1924 O'Banion had acquired
F20 0720 sufficient political might to be able to state: "I always deliver
F20 0730 my borough as per requirements".   But whose requirements?
F20 0740 Until 1924 O'Banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had
F20 0750 kept his North Side domain solidly Democratic. There was a question-and-answer
F20 0760 gag that went around at that time: Q& "Who'll
F20 0770 carry the Forty-second and Forty-third wards"? A& "O'Banion,
F20 0780 in his pistol pocket". But as November 1924 drew close the Democratic
F20 0785 hierarchy
F20 0790 was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O'Banion
F20 0810 was being wooed by the opposition, and was meeting and conferring
F20 0820 with important Republicans. To forestall any change of allegiance,
F20 0830 the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O'Banion,
F20 0840 as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where
F20 0850 his loyalties lay.   The reception was held in a private dining
F20 0860 room of the Webster Hotel on Lincoln Park West. It was an interesting
F20 0870 fraternisation of ex-convicts, union racketeers, ward heelers,
F20 0880 sold-out officials, and gunmen. The guest list is in itself a little
F20 0890 parable of the state of American civic life at this time. It included
F20 0900 the top O'Banion men and Chief of Detectives Michael Hughes.
F20 0910    When Mayor Dever heard of the banquet he summoned Hughes
F20 0920 for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department
F20 0930 by consorting with these felons and fixers. Hughes said that he had
F20 0940 understood the party was to be in honour of Jerry O'Connor, the
F20 0950 proprieter of a Loop gambling house. "But when I arrived and recognised
F20 0960 a number of notorious characters I had thrown into the detective
F20 0970 bureau basement half a dozen times, I knew I had been framed, and
F20 0980 withdrew almost at once".   In fact, O'Connor was honoured
F20 0990 during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin.
F20 1000 There was a brief interruption while one of O'Banion's men
F20 1010 jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering
F20 1020 him for a tip. Then O'Banion was presented with a platinum
F20 1030 watch set with rubies and diamonds.   This dinner was the start
F20 1040 of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians,
F20 1050 which, prior to 1924, says Pasley, "had been maintained with
F20 1060 more or less stealth", but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious
F20 1070 gatherings, denounced by a clergyman as "Belshazzar feasts",
F20 1080 at which "politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters,
F20 1090 openly, in the big downtown hotels". Pasley continued: "They
F20 1100 became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the
F20 1110 moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments
F20 1120 in 1928-29".   However, this inaugural feast did its sponsors
F20 1130 no good whatever. O'Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes
F20 1140 to his loyalty, and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican
F20 1150 deal. On Election Day- November 4- he energetically marshalled
F20 1160 his force of bludgeon men, bribers, and experts in forging repeat
F20 1170 votes. The result was a landslide for the Republican candidates.
F20 1180    This further demonstration of O'Banion's ballooning power
F20 1190 did not please Torrio and Capone. In the past year there had been
F20 1200 too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement
F20 1210 for their liking. He behaved publicly with a cocky, swaggering truculence
F20 1220 that offended their vulpine Latin minds, and behaved towards
F20 1230 them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath
F20 1240 their blandness. They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado- as,
F20 1250 when his bodyguard, Yankee Schwartz, complained that he had been snubbed
F20 1260 by Dave Miller, a prize-fight referee, chieftain of a Jewish
F20 1270 gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation, who were Hirschey,
F20 1280 a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with Torrio and O'Banion,
F20 1290 Frank, a policeman, and Max, the youngest. To settle this
F20 1300 slight, O'Banion went down to the La Salle Theatre in the Loop,
F20 1310 where, he had learned, Dave Miller was attending the opening of
F20 1320 a musical comedy. At the end of the performance, Dave and Max came
F20 1330 out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed
F20 1340 first nighters. O'Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave, severely
F20 1350 wounding him in the stomach. A second bullet ricocheted off Max's
F20 1370 belt buckle, leaving him unhurt but in some distress. O'Banion
F20 1380 tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre; he was neither
F20 1390 prosecuted nor even arrested. That sort of braggadocio, for that sort
F20 1400 of reason, in the view of Torrio and Capone, was a nonsense.
F20 1410 A further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was
F20 1420 when two policemen held up a Torrio beer convoy on a West Side street
F20 1430 and demanded $300 to let it through. One of the beer-runners telephoned
F20 1440 O'Banion- on a line tapped by the detective bureau- and
F20 1450 reported the situation. O'Banion's reaction was: "Three hundred
F20 1460 dollars! To them bums? Why, I can get them knocked off for
F20 1470 half that much". Upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle
F20 1480 squads to prevent trouble if O'Banion should send his gunmen out
F20 1490 to deal with the hijacking policemen. But in the meantime the beer-runner,
F20 1500 unhappy with this solution, telephoned Torrio and returned to
F20 1510 O'Banion with the message: "Say, Dionie, I just been talking
F20 1520 to Johnny, and he said to let them cops have the three hundred. He
F20 1530 says he don't want no trouble".   But Torrio and Capone had
F20 1540 graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman. For three years,
F20 1550 since the liquor territorial conference, Torrio had, with his elastic
F20 1560 patience, and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent
F20 1570 warfare and disaster to business, tolerated O'Banion's impudent
F20 1580 double-crossing. They had suffered, in sulky silence, the sight of
F20 1590 his sharp practice in Cicero.   When, as a diplomatic gesture
F20 1600 of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election,
F20 1610 Torrio had given O'Banion a slice of Cicero, the profits from
F20 1620 that district had been $20,000 a month. In six months O'Banion had
F20 1630 boosted the profits to $100,000 a month- mainly by bringing pressure
F20 1640 to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the
F20 1650 suburb. These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies
F20 1660 from the Sheldon, Saltis-McErlane, and Druggan-Lake gangs,
F20 1670 and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons;
F20 1680 once again O'Banion's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation
F20 1690 of ill will. The revenue from O'Banion's Cicero territory
F20 1700 went up still higher, until the yield was more than the Torrio-Capone
F20 1710 takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago's South and
F20 1720 West Sides. But he still showed no intention of sharing with the
F20 1730 syndicate. At last, even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still,
F20 1740 and he tentatively suggested that O'Banion should take a percentage
F20 1750 in the Stickney brothels in return for one from his Cicero beer
F20 1760 concession. O'Banion's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal.
F20 1770    Still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the O'Banion
F20 1780 gang's seizure from a West Side marshalling yard of a freight-car
F20 1790 load of Canadian whisky worth $100,000 and by one of the biggest
F20 1800 coups of the Prohibition era- the Sibley warehouse robbery,
F20 1810 which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation. Here was
F20 1820 stored $1,000,000 worth of bonded whisky. These 1750 cases were carted
F20 1830 off in a one-night operation by the O'Banion men, who left in
F20 1840 their stead the same number of barrels filled with water.
F21 0010    A tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide, an earthquake
F21 0020 or a volcanic eruption. The most infamous of all was launched by the
F21 0030 explosion of the island of Krakatoa in 1883; it raced across the Pacific
F21 0040 at 300 miles an hour, devastated the coasts of Java and Sumatra
F21 0050 with waves 100 to 130 feet high, and pounded the shore as far away
F21 0060 as San Francisco.   The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic
F21 0070 inundations by huge waves. Whether or not Plato's tale of
F21 0080 the lost continent of Atlantis is true, skeptics concede that the myth
F21 0090 may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times. Indeed,
F21 0100 a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian Sea
F21 0110 in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists
F21 0120 in the Biblical story of the Flood.   One of the most damaging
F21 0130 tsunami on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of November
F21 0140 1, 1755; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away
F21 0150 as the English coast. Tsunami are rare, however, in the Atlantic
F21 0160 Ocean; they are far more common in the Pacific. Japan has had 15
F21 0170 destructive ones (eight of them disastrous) since 1596. The Hawaiian
F21 0180 Islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years.
F21 0190    In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled
F21 0200 into the Inland Sea; one wave swamped more than 1,000 ships and
F21 0210 boats in Osaka Bay. A tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands in 1869
F21 0220 washed away an entire town (Ponoluu), leaving only two forlorn trees
F21 0230 standing where the community had been. In 1896 a Japanese tsunami killed
F21 0240 27,000 people and swept away 10,000 homes.   The dimensions
F21 0250 of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement. An ordinary
F21 0260 sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to
F21 0270 crest- no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1,000 feet in the
F21 0280 Pacific. But a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes
F21 0290 as much as 600 miles from crest to crest. While a wind wave never
F21 0300 travels at more than 60 miles per hour, the velocity of a tsunami in
F21 0310 the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour. The greater
F21 0320 the depth of the water, the greater is the speed of the wave;
F21 0330 Lagrange's law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of
F21 0340 the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity. In
F21 0350 the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles
F21 0360 per hour.   Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length
F21 0370 that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable. Their amplitude
F21 0380 sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest. Usually it
F21 0390 is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build
F21 0400 up to their terrifying heights. On the fateful day in 1896 when the
F21 0410 great waves approached Japan, fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells.
F21 0420 Not until they sailed home at the end of the day, through a sea
F21 0430 strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses, were they aware of what
F21 0440 had happened. The seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water
F21 0450 from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers, drowning
F21 0460 thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore.   The
F21 0470 giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones. They
F21 0480 usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height, but when they pour into
F21 0490 a ~V-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions.
F21 0500    Generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell,
F21 0510 not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers.
F21 0520 This is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore
F21 0530 as the first great trough arrives. Reefs are left high and dry, and
F21 0540 the beaches are covered with stranded fish. At Hilo large numbers
F21 0550 of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach.
F21 0560 Many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives, for some
F21 0570 minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore. After an earthquake
F21 0580 in Japan in 1793 people on the coast at Tugaru were so terrified
F21 0590 by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher
F21 0600 ground. When a second quake came, they dashed back to the beach,
F21 0610 fearing that they might be buried under landslides. Just as they reached
F21 0620 the shore, the first huge wave crashed upon them.   A tsunami
F21 0630 is not a single wave but a series. The waves are separated by intervals
F21 0640 of 15 minutes to an hour or more (because of their great length),
F21 0650 and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great
F21 0660 wave has crashed that it is all over. The waves may keep coming for many
F21 0670 hours. Usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the
F21 0680 biggest.   Among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at Hilo was
F21 0690 Francis P& Shepard of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography,
F21 0700 one of the world's foremost marine geologists. He was able to make
F21 0710 a detailed inspection of the waves. Their onrush and retreat, he reported,
F21 0720 was accompanied by a great hissing, roaring and rattling. The
F21 0730 third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest. On some of the islands'
F21 0740 beaches the waves came in gently; they were steepest on the
F21 0750 shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come.
F21 0760 In Hilo Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high. The highest waves,
F21 0770 55 feet, occurred at Pololu Valley.   Scientists and fishermen
F21 0780 have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon. During
F21 0790 a 1933 tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night. The
F21 0800 luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the
F21 0810 stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism <Noctiluca miliaris>
F21 0820 by the turbulence of the sea. Japanese fishermen have sometimes
F21 0830 observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have
F21 0840 enormously swollen stomachs; the fish have swallowed vast numbers
F21 0850 of bottom-living diatoms, raised to the surface by the disturbance. The
F21 0860 waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and
F21 0870 battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth
F21 0880 of 3,000 feet. Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands.
F21 0890    The tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in
F21 0900 Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised
F21 0910 by Commander C& K& Green of the Coast and Geodetic Survey staff.
F21 0920 It consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber
F21 0930 which record the rise and fall of the water surface. Ordinary water
F21 0940 tides are disregarded. But when waves with a period of between 10 and
F21 0950 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean, they set in motion a corresponding
F21 0960 oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit.
F21 0970 This in turn sets off an alarm, notifying the observers at the
F21 0980 station that a tsunami is in progress. Such equipment has been installed
F21 0990 at Hilo, Midway, Attu and Dutch Harbor. The moment the alarm
F21 1000 goes off, information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu, which
F21 1010 is the center of the warning system.   This center also receives
F21 1020 prompt reports on earthquakes from four Coast Survey stations in the
F21 1030 Pacific which are equipped with seismographs. Its staff makes a preliminary
F21 1040 determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide
F21 1050 stations near the epicenter for a tsunami. By means of charts showing
F21 1060 wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations, it is
F21 1070 possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival
F21 1080 at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the Pacific.
F21 1090 The civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger,
F21 1100 and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps. All
F21 1110 of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system,
F21 1120 and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work
F21 1130 smoothly.   Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami
F21 1140 in the Pacific, but only one was of any consequence. On November 4,
F21 1150 1952, an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka Peninsula.
F21 1160 At 17:07 that afternoon (Greenwich time) the shock was recorded
F21 1170 by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu. The warning system immediately
F21 1180 went into action. Within about an hour with the help of reports
F21 1190 from seismic stations in Alaska, Arizona and California, the quake's
F21 1200 epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees
F21 1210 East longitude. While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came
F21 1220 in from various points in the Pacific (Midway reported it was covered
F21 1230 with nine feet of water), the Hawaiian station made its calculations
F21 1240 and notified the military services and the police that the first big
F21 1250 wave would arrive at Honolulu at 23:30 Greenwich time.   It
F21 1260 turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946. They hurled a
F21 1270 cement barge against a freighter in Honolulu Harbor, knocked down telephone
F21 1280 lines, marooned automobiles, flooded lawns, killed six cows.
F21 1290 But not a single human life was lost, and property damage in the Hawaiian
F21 1300 Islands did not exceed $800,000. There is little doubt that the
F21 1310 warning system saved lives and reduced the damage.   But it is
F21 1320 plain that a warning system, however efficient, is not enough. In the
F21 1330 vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be restrictions against
F21 1340 building homes on exposed coasts, or at least a requirement that they
F21 1350 be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves.
F21 1360 ## The key to the world of geology is change; nothing remains the
F21 1370 same. Life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the
F21 1380 sea to complex combinations in man. The land, too, is changing, and
F21 1390 earthquakes are daily reminders of this. Earthquakes result when movements
F21 1400 in the earth twist rocks until they break. Sometimes this is accompanied
F21 1410 by visible shifts of the ground surface; often the shifts
F21 1420 cannot be seen, but they are there; and everywhere can be found scars
F21 1430 of earlier breaks once deeply buried. Today's earthquakes are most
F21 1440 numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness is presently concentrated,
F21 1450 but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth
F21 1460 that has not had them.   The effects of earthquakes on civilization
F21 1470 have been widely publicized, even overemphasized. The role of
F21 1480 an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously
F21 1490 frightening, but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular
F21 1500 disaster. Superstition has often blended with fact to color reports.
F21 1510    We have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know
F21 1520 about the earth's interior, for they send waves through the earth
F21 1530 which emerge with information about the materials through which they
F21 1540 have traveled. These waves have shown that 1,800 miles below the surface
F21 1550 a liquid core begins, and that it, in turn, has a solid inner core.
F21 1560    Earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface,
F21 1570 but they do not occur at greater depths. Two unsolved mysteries are
F21 1580 based on these facts. (1) As far down as 400 miles below the surface
F21 1590 the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to
F21 1600 twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking, as rigid surface
F21 1610 rocks do. (2) If earthquakes do occur at such depths, why not deeper?
F21 1620    Knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been
F21 1630 applied in various fields. In the search for oil and gas, we make
F21 1640 similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from
F21 1650 them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation
F21 1660 of these resources. We have also developed techniques for recognizing
F21 1670 and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the
F21 1680 ground which they generate.   The following discussion of this subject
F21 1690 has been adapted from the book {Causes of Catastrophe} by
F21 1700 L& Don Leet. #THE RESTLESS EARTH AND ITS INTERIOR# <At twelve
F21 1710 minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday>, April 18, 1906,
F21 1720 San Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake. A sharp tremor
F21 1730 was followed by a jerky roll.
F22 0010    {IN} Ireland's County Limerick, near the River
F22 0020 Shannon, there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen, which
F22 0030 means "Garden of Owen". Undoubtedly none of the residents realize
F22 0040 the influence their town has had on American military history,
F22 0050 or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name. The cry "Garryowen"!
F22 0060 bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was
F22 0070 the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of Cheyennes,
F22 0080 Sioux and Apaches, Mexican <banditos> under Pancho Villa, Japanese
F22 0090 in the South Pacific, and Chinese and North Korean Communists
F22 0100 in Korea. Garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th U& S& Cavalry
F22 0110 Regiment, "The Fighting Seventh".   Today a battle
F22 0120 cry may seem an anachronism, for in the modern Army, <esprit de corps>
F22 0130 has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables. But don't
F22 0140 tell that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh, especially in a
F22 0150 saloon on Saturday night.   Of all the thousands of men who have
F22 0160 served in the 7th Cav, perhaps no one knows its spirit better than
F22 0170 Lieutenant Colonel Melbourne C& Chandler. Wiry and burr-headed,
F22 0180 with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals, Chandler
F22 0190 is the epitome of the old-time trooper. The truth is, however, that
F22 0200 when Mel Chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he
F22 0210 had ever ridden
F22 0220 was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded
F22 0230 was a pencil.   Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical
F22 0240 Service Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the Kansas
F22 0250 City Medical Depot when he decided that if he was going to make
F22 0260 the Army his career, he wanted to be in the fighting part of it. Though
F22 0270 he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other
F22 0280 desk officer, he managed to get transferred to the combat forces. The
F22 0290 next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer
F22 0300 of Troop ~H, 7th Cavalry, in the middle of corps maneuvers in Japan.
F22 0310    Outside of combat, he couldn't have landed in a tougher
F22 0320 spot. First of all, no unit likes to have a new ~CO brought in from
F22 0330 the outside, especially when he's an armchair trooper. Second,
F22 0340 if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him, it's
F22 0350 on maneuvers. In combat, helping your ~CO make a fool of himself
F22 0360 might mean getting yourself killed. But in maneuvers, with the top
F22 0370 brass watching him all the time, it's easy.   Chandler understood
F22 0380 this and expected the worst. But his first few days with Troop
F22 0390 ~H were full of surprises, beginning with First Sergeant Robert
F22 0400 Early. Chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice.
F22 0410 Instead Sergeant Early was quiet, sharp and confident. He had
F22 0420 enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and had immediately
F22 0430 set about learning his new trade. There was no weapon Early could not
F22 0440 take apart and reassemble blind-folded. He could lead a patrol and
F22 0450 he knew his paper work. Further, he had taken full advantage of the Army's
F22 0460 correspondence courses. He not only knew soldiering, but mathematics,
F22 0470 history and literature as well.   But for all his erudite
F22 0480 confidence, Sergeant Early was right out of the Garryowen mold.
F22 0490 He was filled with the spirit of the Fighting Seventh. That saved
F22 0500 Mel Chandler. Sergeant Early let the new ~CO know just how lucky
F22 0510 he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the United
F22 0520 States Army. He fed the captain bits of history about the troops and
F22 0530 the regiment. For example, it was a battalion of the 7th Cavalry
F22 0540 under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been wiped out at the
F22 0550 Battle of The Little Big Horn.   It didn't take Captain
F22 0560 Chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition
F22 0570 on his shoulders as commander of Troop ~H. But what made the
F22 0580 load lighter was the realization that every officer, non-com and trooper
F22 0590 was ready and willing to help him carry it, for the good of the troop
F22 0600 and the regiment.   Maneuvers over, the 7th returned to garrison
F22 0610 duty in Tokyo, Captain Chandler still with them. It was the
F22 0620 7th Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the Imperial
F22 0630 Palace of the Emperor. But still Mel Chandler was not completely
F22 0640 convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word, "Garryowen".
F22 0650 The final proof was a small incident.   It happened
F22 0660 at the St& Patrick's Day party, a big affair for a regiment which
F22 0670 had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains
F22 0680 of an Irish march. In the middle of the party Chandler looked
F22 0690 up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him, each beaming above
F22 0700 the biggest, greenest shamrock he had ever seen. The faces belonged
F22 0710 to Lieutenant Marvin Goulding, his wife and their two children. And
F22 0720 when the singing began, it was the Gouldings who sang the old Irish
F22 0730 songs the best.   Though there was an occasional good-natured
F22 0740 chuckle about Marvin Goulding, the Jewish officer from Chicago,
F22 0750 singing tearfully about the ould sod, no one really thought it was strange.
F22 0760 For Marvin Goulding, like Giovanni Martini, the bugler boy
F22 0770 who carried Custer's last message, or Margarito Lopez, the one-man
F22 0780 Army on Leyte, was a Garryowen, through and through. It was no
F22 0790 coincidence
F22 0800 that Goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders
F22 0810 in the regiment.   And so Mel Chandler got the spirit of Garryowen.
F22 0820 He set out to keep Troop ~H the best troop in the best regiment.
F22 0830 One of his innovations was to see to it that every man- cook
F22 0840 and clerk as well as rifleman- qualified with every weapon in the
F22 0850 troop. Even the mess sergeant, Bill Brown, a dapper, cocky transfer
F22 0860 from an airborne division, went out on the range.   The troop received
F22 0870 a new leader, Lieutenant Robert M& Carroll, fresh out of
F22 0880 ~ROTC and bucking for Regular Army status. Carroll was sharp
F22 0890 and military, but he was up against tough competition for that ~RA
F22 0900 berth, and he wanted to play it cool. So Mel Chandler set out to
F22 0910 sell him on the spirit of Garryowen, just as he himself had been sold
F22 0920 a short time before.   When the Korean war began, on June 25,
F22 0930 1950, the anniversary of the day Custer had gone down fighting at the
F22 0940 Little Big Horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead
F22 0950 of Leyte during World War /2,, the 7th Cavalry was not in the
F22 0960 best fighting condition. Its entire complement of non-commissioned
F22 0970 officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit,
F22 0980 and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across Luzon in World
F22 0990 War /2,.   Just a month after the Korean War broke out,
F22 1000 the 7th Cavalry was moving into the lines, ready for combat. From
F22 1010 then on the Fighting Seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting
F22 1020 in Korea.   One night on the Naktong River, Mel Chandler
F22 1030 called on that fabled <esprit de corps>. The regiment was dug in
F22 1040 on the east side of the river and the North Koreans were steadily building
F22 1050 up a concentration of crack troops on the other side. The troopers
F22 1060 knew an attack was coming, but they didn't know when, and they
F22 1070 didn't know where. At 6 o'clock on the morning of August 12, they
F22 1080 were in doubt no longer. Then it came, against Troop ~H.
F22 1090    The enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full
F22 1100 force of 1000 men, armed with Russian machine guns, attacked the position
F22 1110 held by Chandler's men. They came in waves. First came the
F22 1120 cannon fodder, white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive
F22 1130 human battering ram. They were followed by crack North Korean troops,
F22 1140 who mounted one charge after another. They overran the 7th Cav's
F22 1150 forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers, over
F22 1160 piles of their own dead.   Another force flanked the company
F22 1170 and took up a position on a hill to the rear. Captain Chandler saw
F22 1180 that it was building up strength. He assembled a group of 25 men, composed
F22 1190 of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation, the company clerk, supply
F22 1200 men, cooks and drivers, and led them to the hill. One of the more
F22 1210 seriously wounded was Lieutenant Carroll, the young officer bucking
F22 1220 for the Regular Army. Chandler left Carroll at the bottom of the hill
F22 1230 to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight.   Then
F22 1240 Mel Chandler started up the hill. He took one step, two, broke
F22 1250 into a trot and then into a run. The first thing he knew the words "Garryowen"!
F22 1260 burst from his throat. His followers shouted the old
F22 1270 battle cry after him and charged the hill, firing as they ran.
F22 1280    The Koreans fell back, but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned
F22 1290 down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire. Chandler, looking to
F22 1300 right and left to see how his men were faring, suddenly saw another figure
F22 1310 bounding up the hill, hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry
F22 1320 as he ran. It was Bob Carroll, who had suddenly found himself imbued
F22 1330 with the spirit of Garryowen. He had formed his own task force
F22 1340 of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a Fighting Seventh charge.
F22 1350 Because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been
F22 1360 pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again. But an enemy
F22 1370 grenade hit Carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously. He
F22 1380 went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face
F22 1390 of
F22 1400 the withering enemy fire.   Enemy reinforcements came pouring down,
F22 1410 seeking a soft spot. They found it at the junction between Troops
F22 1420 ~H and ~G, and prepared to counterattack. Marvin Goulding saw
F22 1430 what was happening. He turned to his platoon. "Okay, men", he
F22 1440 said. "Follow me". Goulding leaped to his feet and started forward,
F22 1450 "Garryowen"! on his lips, his men following. But the bullets
F22 1460 whacked home before he finished his battle cry and Marvin Goulding
F22 1470 fell dead. For an instant his men hesitated, unable to believe that
F22 1475 their lieutenant,
F22 1480 the most popular officer in the regiment, was dead.
F22 1490 Then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and, cursing, screaming
F22 1500 and hollering "Garryowen"! they charged into the enemy like
F22 1510 wild men.   That finished the job that Captain Chandler and Lieutenant
F22 1520 Carroll had begun. Goulding's platoon pushed back the enemy
F22 1530 soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack. Reinforcements
F22 1540 came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by Goulding's
F22 1550 platoon. The North Koreans threw away their guns and fled
F22 1560 across the rice paddies. Artillery and air strikes were called in
F22 1570 to kill them by the hundreds.   Though Bob Carroll seemed to have
F22 1580 had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade, he lived.
F22 1590 Today he is a major- in the Regular Army.   So filled
F22 1600 was Mel Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen that after Korea was
F22 1610 over, he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment.
F22 1620 After years of digging, nights and weekends, he put together the
F22 1630 big, profusely illustrated book, <Of Garryowen and Glory>, which
F22 1640 is probably the most complete history of any military unit. ## The
F22 1650 battle of the Naktong River is just one example of how the battle
F22 1660 cry and the spirit of The Fighting Seventh have paid off. For nearly
F22 1670 a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the
F22 1680 regiment.   Take the case of Major Marcus A& Reno, who survived
F22 1690 the Battle of The Little Big Horn in 1876. From the enlisted
F22 1700 men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried
F22 1710 to rape, a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike Marcus
F22 1720 Reno. Many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him. But
F22 1730 when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice
F22 1740 made against him, the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield
F22 1750 and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left
F22 1760 to be tortured by the Sioux, refused to say a harsh word against him.
F22 1770 He was a member of The Fighting Seventh.   Although it was
F22 1775 at
F22 1780 the Battle of The Little Horn, about which more words have been
F22 1790 written than any other battle in American history, that the 7th Cavalry
F22 1800 first made its mark in history, the regiment was ten years old by
F22 1810 then. Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer was the regiment's
F22 1820 first permanent commander and, like such generals as George
F22 1830 S& Patton and Terry de la Mesa Allen in their rise to military
F22 1840 prominence,
F22 1850 Custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare.   During
F22 1860 the Civil War, Custer, who achieved a brilliant record, was
F22 1865 made
F22 1870 brigadier general at the age of 23.   He finished the war as
F22 1880 a major general, commanding a full division, and at 25 was the youngest
F22 1890 major general in the history of the U& S& Army.
F23 0010 I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident, in
F23 0020 the sense that everyone agrees with them. If they were, Walter Lippmann
F23 0030 would be writing the same columns as George Sokolsky, and Herblock
F23 0040 would have nothing to draw cartoons about. I do mean, however, that
F23 0050 <I> take them for granted, and that everything I shall be saying
F23 0060 would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions. _ASSUMPTION
F23 0070 1._ The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish
F23 0080 a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom
F23 0090 and justice and peace and material prosperity; and in particular-
F23 0100 since this is our special responsibility- that these conditions
F23 0110 be enjoyed by the people of the United States. I speak of "the largest
F23 0120 possible measure" because any person who supposes that these
F23 0130 conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved- ever- reckons
F23 0140 without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human
F23 0150 beings, and is therefore a dangerous man to have around. _ASSUMPTION
F23 0160 2._ These conditions are unobtainable- are not even approachable
F23 0170 in the qualified sense I have indicated- without the prior defeat
F23 0180 of world Communism. This is true for two reasons: because Communism
F23 0190 is both doctrinally, and in practice, antithetical to these conditions;
F23 0200 and because Communists have the will and, as long as Soviet
F23 0210 power remains intact, the capacity to prevent their realization. Moreover,
F23 0220 as Communist power increases, the enjoyment of these conditions
F23 0230 throughout the world diminishes <pro rata> and the possibility of
F23 0240 their restoration becomes increasingly remote. _ASSUMPTION 3._ It
F23 0250 follows that victory over Communism is the dominant, proximate goal
F23 0260 of American policy. Proximate in the sense that there are more distant,
F23 0270 more "positive" ends we seek, to which victory over Communism
F23 0280 is but a means. But dominant in the sense that every other objective,
F23 0290 no matter how worthy intrinsically, must defer to it. Peace is a worthy
F23 0300 objective; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the
F23 0310 Communists out of Berlin, then we must fight. Freedom, in the sense
F23 0320 of self-determination, is a worthy objective; but if granting self-determination
F23 0330 to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into
F23 0340 the Sino-Soviet orbit, then Algerian freedom must be postponed. Justice
F23 0350 is a worthy objective; but if justice for Bantus entails driving
F23 0360 the government of the Union of South Africa away from the West,
F23 0370 then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards
F23 0380 yet a while longer. Prosperity is a worthy objective; but if providing
F23 0390 higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient
F23 0400 guns to resist Communist aggression, then material sacrifices and
F23 0410 denials will have to be made. It may be, of course, that such objectives
F23 0420 can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism;
F23 0430 my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be
F23 0440 resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant
F23 0450 world- the absence of Soviet Communist power. #THE USES OF
F23 0460 POWER# This much having been said, the question remains whether we
F23 0470 have the resources for the job we have to do- defeat Communism-
F23 0480 and, if so, how those resources ought to be used. This brings us squarely
F23 0490 to the problem of <power,> and the uses a nation makes of power.
F23 0500 I submit that this is the key problem of international relations, that
F23 0510 it always has been, that it always will be. And I suggest further
F23 0520 that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of
F23 0530 American policy-makers, ever since we assumed free world leadership
F23 0540 in 1945, to deal with this problem realistically and seriously.
F23 0550 In the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting
F23 0560 the question of power, and I think we might begin by trying to put them
F23 0570 into proper focus. One was demonstrably false; the other, for the
F23 0580 most part, true.   The first was that America had become- or
F23 0590 was in danger of becoming- a second-rate military power. I know I
F23 0600 do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention. You
F23 0610 may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment-
F23 0620 I certainly do- but you know any comparison of over-all American
F23 0630 strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United States
F23 0640 not only superior, but so superior both in present weapons and in the
F23 0650 development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent
F23 0660 feature of U&S&-Soviet relations for the foreseeable future.
F23 0670    I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority
F23 0680 on those Americans who have doubts, and I think Mr& Jameson
F23 0690 Campaigne has done it well in his new book <American Might and Soviet
F23 0710 Myth>. Suppose, he says, that the tables were turned, and we
F23 0720 were in the Soviets' position: "There would be more than 2,000
F23 0730 modern Soviet fighters, all better than ours, stationed at 250 bases
F23 0740 in Mexico and the Caribbean. Overwhelming Russian naval power would
F23 0750 always be within a few hundred miles of our coast. Half of the population
F23 0760 of the U&S& would be needed to work on arms just to feed
F23 0770 the people". Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where
F23 0780 oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity.
F23 0790 Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would
F23 0800 severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the Soviets even in the
F23 0810 missile field which is reputed to be our main strength.   If
F23 0820 we look at the situation this way, we can get an idea of Khrushchev's
F23 0830 nightmarish worries- or, at least, of the worries he might have if
F23 0840 his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage. #U&S& "PRESTIGE"#
F23 0850 The other charge was that America's political position
F23 0860 in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years. The
F23 0870 contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it
F23 0880 ever was during the campaign, but once that has been done, I fail to
F23 0890 see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it.
F23 0900    The argument was typically advanced in terms of U&S& "prestige".
F23 0910 Prestige, however, is only a minor part of the problem; and
F23 0920 even then, it is a concept that can be highly misleading. Prestige
F23 0930 is a measure of how other people think of you, well or ill. But contrary
F23 0940 to what was implied during the campaign, prestige is surely not important
F23 0950 for its own sake. Only the vain and incurably sentimental among
F23 0960 us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed
F23 0970 by our strength as they ought to be. The thing to lose sleep over
F23 0980 is what people, having concluded that we are weaker than we are, are
F23 0990 likely to do about it.   The evidence suggests that foreign peoples
F23 1000 believe the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union, and
F23 1010 is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead. This ignorant
F23 1020 estimate, I repeat, is not of any interest in itself; but it becomes
F23 1030 very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically
F23 1040 do- namely, by taking steps to end up on what appears to be
F23 1050 the winning side. To the extent, then, that declining U&S& prestige
F23 1060 means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on
F23 1070 an ultimate American defeat, and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet
F23 1080 intimidation, there is reason for concern.   Still, these guesses
F23 1090 about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the
F23 1100 actual power relationship between the Soviet Union and ourselves. Here
F23 1110 I do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and
F23 1120 overwhelming but of political power- of influence, if you will-
F23 1130 about which the relevant questions are: Is Soviet influence throughout
F23 1140 the world greater or less than it was ten years ago? And is Western
F23 1150 influence greater or less than it used to be? #COMMUNIST GAINS#
F23 1160 In answering these questions, we need to ask not merely whether
F23 1170 Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy
F23 1180 before, and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform
F23 1190 are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded:
F23 1200 the success of Communism's war against the West does not depend
F23 1210 on such spectacular and definitive conquests. Success may mean merely
F23 1220 the displacement of Western influence.   Communist political
F23 1230 warfare, we must remember, is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages.
F23 1240 Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they
F23 1250 could not win, the Communists seek to undermine Western power where
F23 1260 the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant- in backwoods guerrilla
F23 1265 skirmishes,
F23 1270 in mob uprisings in the streets, in parliaments, in clandestine
F23 1280 meetings of undercover conspirators, at the United Nations,
F23 1290 on the propaganda front, at diplomatic conferences- preferably at
F23 1300 the highest level.   The Soviets understand, moreover, that the
F23 1310 first step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against
F23 1320 the West. Thus, typically, the first stage of a Communist takeover
F23 1330 is to "neutralize" a country. The second stage is to retain the
F23 1340 nominal classification of "neutralist", while in fact turning the
F23 1350 country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy. And
F23 1360 this may be as far as the process will go. The Kremlin's goal is
F23 1370 the isolation and capture, not of Ghana, but of the United States-
F23 1380 and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade
F23 1390 under a "neutralist" mask, yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries
F23 1400 of the Soviet Foreign Office.   To recite the particulars of
F23 1410 recent Soviet successes is hardly reassuring.   Six years ago
F23 1420 French Indochina, though in troubie, was in the Western camp. Today
F23 1430 Northern Vietnam is overtly Communist; Laos is teetering between
F23 1440 Communism and pro-Communist neutralism; Cambodia is, for all
F23 1450 practical purposes, neutralist.   Indonesia, in the early days of
F23 1460 the Republic, leaned toward the West. Today Sukarno's government
F23 1470 is heavily besieged by avowed Communists, and for all of its "neutralist"
F23 1480 pretensions, it is a firm ally of Soviet policy.   Ceylon
F23 1490 has moved from a pro-Western orientation to a neutralism openly
F23 1500 hostile to the West.   In the Middle East, Iraq, Syria and
F23 1510 Egypt were, a short while ago, in the Western camp. Today the Nasser
F23 1520 and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West, are dependent
F23 1530 for their military power on Soviet equipment and personnel;
F23 1540 in almost every particular follow the Kremlin's foreign policy line.
F23 1550    A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve. Never
F23 1560 mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination:
F23 1570 the point is that in the struggle for the world that
F23 1580 vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the West. Today,
F23 1590 Africa is swerving violently away from the West and plunging,
F23 1600 it would seem, into the Soviet orbit.   Latin America was once
F23 1610 an area as "safe" for the West as Nebraska was for Nixon. Today
F23 1620 it is up for grabs. One Latin American country, Cuba, has become
F23 1630 a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast. In some countries
F23 1640 the trend has gone further than others: Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela
F23 1650 are displaying open sympathy for Castroism, and there is no country-
F23 1660 save the Dominican Republic whose funeral services we recently
F23 1670 arranged- where Castroism and anti-Americanism does not prevent
F23 1680 the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause.
F23 1690    Only in Europe have our lines remained firm- and there only on the
F23 1700 surface. The strains of neutralism are running strong, notably in
F23 1710 England, and even in Germany. #OPPORTUNITIES MISSED# What have
F23 1720 we to show by way of counter-successes? We have had opportunities-
F23 1730 clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the Iron
F23 1740 Curtain. There was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised
F23 1750 and mourned, but did nothing about. There was the Polish Revolution
F23 1760 which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable
F23 1770 to Soviet interests. There was the revolution in Tibet which we pretended
F23 1780 did not exist. Only in one instance have we moved purposively
F23 1790 and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power: in Guatemala.
F23 1800 And contrary to what has been said recently, we did not wait for "outside
F23 1810 pressures" and "world opinion" to bring down that Communist
F23 1820 government; we moved decisively to effect an anti-Communist
F23 1825 <coup
F23 1830 d'etat>. We served our national interests, and by so doing we
F23 1840 saved the Guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery.
F24 0010    THE FIRST RATTLE of the machine guns, at 7:10 in the evening,
F24 0020 roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear.   "Sounds
F24 0030 exactly like last time". The young man spoke steadily enough,
F24 0040 but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven. The middle-aged man
F24 0050 said over and over, "Why did I come here, why did I come
F24 0055 here".
F24 0060 Then he was sick. Amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons,
F24 0070 I heard the thumping of mortars. Then the lights went out.
F24 0075    This was my
F24 0080 second day in Vientiane, the administrative capital of
F24 0090 Laos, and my thoughts were none too brave. Where was my flashlight?
F24 0100 Where should I go? To my room? Better stay in the hotel lobby,
F24 0110 where the walls looked good and thick.   Chinese and Indian
F24 0120 merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters. Hotel
F24 0130 attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby. A woman with a small
F24 0140 boy slipped in between them. "Please", she said, "please".
F24 0150 She held out her hand to show that she had money.   The American
F24 0160 newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office. But what
F24 0170 was the story? Had the Communist-led Pathet Lao finally come this
F24 0180 far? Or was it another revolt inside Vientiane?   "Let's
F24 0190 play hero", I said. "Let's go to the roof and see". #GUNFIRE
F24 0200 SAVES THE MOON# By 7:50 the answer was plain. There had
F24 0210 been an eclipse of the moon. A traditional Lao explanation is that
F24 0220 the moon was being swallowed by a toad, and the remedy was to make all
F24 0230 possible noise, ideally with firearms.   The din was successful,
F24 0240 too, for just before the moon disappeared, the frightened toad had
F24 0245 begun
F24 0250 to spit it out again, which meant good luck all around.   How
F24 0270 quaint it all seemed the next day. A restaurant posted a reminder to
F24 0280 patrons "who became excited and left without paying their checks".
F24 0290 But everyone I met had sought cover first and asked questions later.
F24 0300 And no wonder, for Vientiane, the old City of Sandalwood, had
F24 0310 become the City of Bullet Holes.   I saw holes in planes at the
F24 0320 airport and in cars in the streets. Along the main thoroughfares hardly
F24 0330 a house had not been peppered. In place of the police headquarters
F24 0340 was a new square filled with rubble. Mortars had demolished the
F24 0350 defense ministry and set fire to the American Embassy next door. What
F24 0360 had been the ambassador's suite was now jagged walls of blackened
F24 0370 brick.   This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane,
F24 0380 fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments
F24 0390 had ruled here in three days (December 9-11, 1960). And now, in March,
F24 0400 all Laos suffered a state of siege. The Pathet Lao forces held
F24 0410 two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more.
F24 0420 Throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush
F24 0430 and death.   "And it's all the more tragic because it's
F24 0440 so little deserved", said Mr& J& J& A& Frans, a Belgian
F24 0450 official of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
F24 0460 Organization. We talked after I hailed his Jeep marked with
F24 0470 the U& N& flag.   Practically all the people of Laos, he
F24 0480 explained- about two million of them- are rice farmers, and the means
F24 0490 and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel
F24 0500 plows. They look after their fields and children and water buffaloes
F24 0510 in ten or eleven thousand villages, with an average of 200 souls.
F24 0520 Nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are. They spread
F24 0530 over an area no larger than Oregon; yet they include peoples as different
F24 0540 from one another as Oregonians are from Patagonians. #LIFE
F24 0550 MUST BE KEPT IN HARMONY# "What matters here is family loyalty;
F24 0560 faith in the Buddha and staying at peace with the <phis>, the spirits;
F24 0570 and to live in harmony with nature".   Harmony in Laos?
F24 0580 "Precisely", said Mr& Frans. He spoke of the season of
F24 0590 dryness and dust, brought by the monsoon from the northeast, in harmony
F24 0600 with the season of rain and mud, brought by the monsoon from the southwest.
F24 0610 The slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering
F24 0620 Mekong River. Shy, slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with
F24 0630 the frangipani by the wayside. Even life in harmony with death. For
F24 0640 so long as death was not violent, it was natural and to be welcomed,
F24 0650 making a funeral a feast.   To many a Frenchman- they came
F24 0660 95 years ago, colonized, and stayed until Laos became independent in
F24 0670 1953- the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than Tahiti.
F24 0680 Yet Laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen
F24 0690 around the globe. The Pathet Lao, stiffened by Communist Veterans
F24 0700 from neighboring North Viet Nam, were supplied by Soviet aircraft.
F24 0710 The Royal Lao Army, on the other hand, was paid and equipped with
F24 0720 American funds. In six years, U& S& aid had amounted to more
F24 0730 than $1.60 for each American- a total of three hundred million dollars.
F24 0740    We were there at a moment when the situation in Laos threatened
F24 0750 to ignite another war among the world's giants. Even if it
F24 0760 did not, how would this little world of gentle people cope with its
F24 0770 new reality of grenades and submachine guns?   To find out, we
F24 0780 traveled throughout that part of Laos still nominally controlled, in
F24 0790 the daytime at least, by the Royal Lao Army: from Attopeu, the
F24 0795 City
F24 0800 of Buffalo Dung in the southeast, to Muong Sing, the City of
F24 0810 Lions in the northwest, close to Communist China (map, page 250).
F24 0820 We rode over roads so rough that our Jeep came to rest atop the soil
F24 0830 between ruts, all four wheels spinning uselessly. We flew in rickety
F24 0840 planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn't crash. In the
F24 0850 end we ran into Communist artillery fire.   "We" were Bill
F24 0860 Garrett of the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC Illustrations Staff, whose
F24 0870 three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any
F24 0880 fighting man we met; Boun My, our interpreter; and myself.
F24 0890    Boun My- the name means one who has a <boun>, a celebration, and
F24 0900 is therefore lucky- was born in Savannakhet, the Border of Paradise.
F24 0910 He had attended three universities in the United States. But
F24 0920 he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of Vientiane,
F24 0930 including the royal capital, Luang Prabang. Before the airplanes
F24 0940 came, he said, travel in Laos was just about impossible. #PRIME
F24 0950 MINISTER MOVES FAST# Alas, so it almost proved for us, too. To
F24 0960 go outside the few cities required permits. and getting them seemed
F24 0970 a life's work. Nobody wanted Americans to be hurt or captured, and
F24 0980 few soldiers could be spared as escorts.   We were told that to
F24 0990 the Pathet Lao, a kidnaped American was worth at least $750, a fortune
F24 1000 in Laos. Everyone had heard of the American contractor who had
F24 1010 spurned an escort. Now Pathet Lao propagandists were reported marching
F24 1020 him barefoot from village to village, as evidence of evil American
F24 1030 intervention.   Although we enjoyed our rounds of the government
F24 1040 offices in Vientiane, with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation
F24 1050 in French, we were getting nowhere. We had nearly decided
F24 1060 that all the tales of Lao lethargy must be true, when we were invited
F24 1070 to take a trip with the Prime Minister. Could we be ready in 15
F24 1080 minutes? His Highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of
F24 1090 town, and he was eager to be off. #PRINCE WEARS TEN-GALLON HAT# And
F24 1100 so, after a flight southeast to Savannakhet, we found ourselves bouncing
F24 1110 along in a Jeep right behind the Land-Rover of Prince Boun
F24 1120 Oum of Champassak, a tall man of Churchillian mien in a bush jacket
F24 1130 and a ten-gallon hat from Texas. From his shoulder bag peeked the
F24 1140 seven-inch barrel of a Luger.   The temperature rose to 105`.
F24 1150 With our company of soldiers, we made one long column of reddish dust.
F24 1160    In Keng Kok, the City of Silkworms, the Prime Minister
F24 1170 bought fried chickens and fried cicadas, and two notebooks for me.
F24 1180 Then we drove on, until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice
F24 1190 fields, bouncing across their squat earth walls.   It was a
F24 1200 spleen-crushing day. An hour of bouncing, a brief stop in a village to
F24 1210 inspect a new school or dispensary. More bouncing, another stop, a
F24 1220 new house for teachers, a new well. Then off again, rushing to keep up.
F24 1230 We were miserable.   But our two Jeep mates- Keo Viphakone
F24 1240 from Luang Prabang and John Cool from Beaver, Pennsylvania-
F24 1250 were beaming under their coatings of dust. Together they had probably
F24 1260 done more than any other men to help push Laos toward the 20th century-
F24 1270 constructively. Mr& Keo, once a diplomat in Paris and Washington,
F24 1280 was Commissioner of Rural Affairs. John, an engineer and anthropologist
F24 1290 with a doctorate from the London School of Economics,
F24 1300 headed the rural development division of ~USOM, the United States
F24 1310 Operations Mission administering U&S& aid.   "What
F24 1320 you see are self-help projects", John said. "We ask the people
F24 1330 what they want, and they supply the labor. We send shovels, cement,
F24 1335 nails,
F24 1340 and corrugated iron for roofs. That way they have an infirmary
F24 1350 for $400. We have 2,500 such projects, and they add up to a lot more
F24 1360 than just roads and wells and schools. Ask Mr& Keo".
F24 1370 Mr&
F24 1380 Keo agreed. "Our people have been used to accepting things as
F24 1390 they found them", he said. "Where there was no road, they lived
F24 1400 without one. Now they learn that men can change their surroundings,
F24 1410 through their traditional village elders, without violence. That's
F24 1420 a big step toward a modern state. You might say we are in the nation-building
F24 1430 business".   In the villages people lined up to give
F24 1440 us flowers. Then came coconuts, eggs, and rice wine. The Prime Minister
F24 1450 paid his respects to the Buddhist monks, strode rapidly among the
F24 1460 houses, joked with the local soldiery, and made a speech. The soldiers
F24 1470 are fighting and the Americans are helping, he said, but in the
F24 1480 fight against the Pathet Lao the key factor is the villager himself.
F24 1490    Then we were off again. We did it for three days.   But
F24 1500 our stumping tour of the south wasn't all misery. Crossing the 4,000-foot
F24 1510 width of the Mekong at Champassak, on a raft with an outboard
F24 1520 motor, we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean
F24 1530 breeze. Then we hung overboard in the water.   Briefly we rolled
F24 1540 over a paved road up to Pak Song, on the cool Bolovens Plateau.
F24 1550 The Prince visited the hospital of Operation Brotherhood, supported
F24 1560 by the Junior Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, and fed rice
F24 1570 to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at Pak Song. #STRINGS
F24 1580 KEEP SOULS IN PLACE# In the village of Soukhouma, which means
F24 1590 "Peaceful", we had a <baci>. This is the most endearing of Lao
F24 1600 ceremonies. It takes place in the household, a rite of well-wishing
F24 1610 for myriad occasions- for the traveler, a wedding, a newborn child,
F24 1620 the sick, the New Year, for any good purpose.   The preparations
F24 1630 were elaborate: flowers, candles, incense sticks, rice wine, dozens
F24 1640 of delicacies, and pieces of white cotton string. The strings were
F24 1650 draped around flowers in tall silver bowls (page 261).   The
F24 1660 candles were lighted, and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village
F24 1670 notables. I was careful to keep my feet, the seat of the least worthy
F24 1680 spirits, from pointing at anyone's head, where the worthiest spirits
F24 1690 reside. Now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to
F24 1700 come and join us.   Next he addressed himself to our souls. A
F24 1710 man has 32 souls, one for each part of the body. Those souls like to
F24 1720 wander off, and must be called back.   With the divinities present
F24 1730 and our souls in place, we were wished health, happiness, and power.
F24 1740 Then, one after another, the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings
F24 1750 around our wrists. These were to be kept on, to hold in the 32 souls.
F24 1760    As we stepped out into the sunlight, a man came up to John
F24 1770 Cool and silently showed him his hand. It had a festering hole as
F24 1780 big as a silver dollar. We could see maggots moving.   John said:
F24 1790 "I have some antiseptic salve with me, but it's too late for
F24 1800 that".
F25 0010    My interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening
F25 0020 of religious and ethnic bonds. Jewish identity was often confused
F25 0030 with social and economic strivings. "Being Jewish gives you tremendous
F25 0040 drive", a boy remarked. "It means that you have to get
F25 0050 ahead". When I pressed for a purely religious definition, I encountered
F25 0060 the familiar blend of liberal piety, interfaith good will, and
F25 0070 a small residue of ethnic loyalty.   "I like the tradition",
F25 0080 a girl said. "I like to follow the holidays when they come along.
F25 0090 But you don't have to worship in the traditional way. You can communicate
F25 0100 in your own way. As I see it, there's no real difference between
F25 0110 being Jewish, Catholic, or Protestant".   Another teen-ager
F25 0120 remarked: "Most Jews don't believe in God, but they believe
F25 0130 in people- in helping people". Still another boy asserted:
F25 0140 "To be a good Jew is to do no wrong; it's to be a good person".
F25 0150 When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant,
F25 0160 the boy answered, "It's the same thing".   This accords
F25 0170 with the study by Maier and Spinrad. They discovered that, although
F25 0180 42 per cent of a sample of Catholic students and 15 per cent of the
F25 0190 Protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings
F25 0200 of their religion, only 8 per cent of the Jewish students had this
F25 0210 conviction. The most important aims of the Jewish students were as
F25 0220 follows: to make the world a better place to live in- 30 per cent;
F25 0230 to get happiness for yourself- 28 per cent; and financial independence-
F25 0240 21 per cent.   Nevertheless, most of the teen-agers
F25 0250 I interviewed believed in maintaining their Jewish identity and even
F25 0260 envisioned joining a synagogue or temple. However, they were hostile
F25 0270 to Jewish Orthodoxy, professing to believe in Judaism "but in a
F25 0280 moderate way". One boy said querulously about Orthodox Jews: "It's
F25 0290 the twentieth century, and they don't have to wear beards".
F25 0300    The reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked
F25 0310 force and authority even in the teen-agers' minds. "We were brought
F25 0320 up that way" was one statement which won general assent. "I
F25 0330 want to show respect for my parents' religion" was the way in which
F25 0340 a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of Judaism. Still
F25 0350 another suggested that he would join a temple "for social reasons,
F25 0360 since I'll be living in a suburb".   Intermarriage, which
F25 0370 is generally regarded as a threat to Jewish survival, was regarded not
F25 0380 with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild, clinical disapproval.
F25 0390 Most of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on pragmatic
F25 0400 grounds. "When you marry, you want to have things in common", a
F25 0410 girl said, "and it's hard when you don't marry someone with your
F25 0420 own background".   A fourteen-year-old girl from the Middle
F25 0430 West observed wryly that, in her community, religion inconveniently interfered
F25 0440 with religious activities- at least with the peripheral activities
F25 0450 that many middle class Jews now regard as religious. It appears
F25 0460 that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing
F25 0470 sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because she would
F25 0480 not travel on Saturday and, in addition, required kosher food. Another
F25 0490 girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as "the
F25 0500 only Orthodox girl in town". This is, no doubt, inaccurate,
F25 0510 but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the
F25 0515 nonobservant.
F25 0520 #THE OLDER TEENS# One of the significant things about
F25 0530 Jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented.
F25 0550 Sixty-five per cent of the Jewish teen-agers of college
F25 0560 age attend institutions of higher learning. This is substantially higher
F25 0570 than the figures for the American population at large- 45.6 per
F25 0580 cent for males and 29.2 per cent for females. This may help explain
F25 0590 a phenomenon described by a small-town Jewish boy. In their first two
F25 0600 years in high school, Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions
F25 0610 to win positions on the school teams. However, in their junior and
F25 0620 senior years, they generally forego their athletic pursuits, presumably
F25 0630 in the interest of better academic achievement. It is significant,
F25 0640 too, that the older teen-agers I interviewed believed, unlike the
F25 0650 younger ones, that Jewish students tend to do better academically than
F25 0660 their gentile counterparts.   The percentage of Jewish girls
F25 0670 who attend college is almost as high as that of boys. The motivations
F25 0680 for both sexes, to be sure, are different. The vocational motive is
F25 0690 the dominant one for boys, while Jewish girls attend college for social
F25 0700 reasons and to become culturally developed. One of the significant
F25 0710 developments in American-Jewish life is that the cultural consumers
F25 0720 are largely the women. It is they who read- and make- Jewish
F25 0730 best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them.   In
F25 0740 upper teen Jewish life, the non-college group tends to have a sense
F25 0750 of marginality. "People automatically assume that I'm in college",
F25 0760 a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably. However, among
F25 0770 the girls, there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going
F25 0780 to college. The Jewish working girl almost invariably works in an
F25 0790 office- in contradistinction to gentile factory workers- and, buttressed
F25 0800 by a respectable income, she is likely to dress better and live
F25 0810 more expansively than the college student. She is even prone to regard
F25 0820 the college girl as immature. #THE LOWER-MIDDLE CLASS COLLEGE STUDENT#
F25 0830 One of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish teen-agers
F25 0840 in college is that a great many urban Jews are enabled to attend
F25 0850 local colleges at modest cost. This is particularly true in large centers
F25 0860 of Jewish population like New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia.
F25 0870    What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is
F25 0880 that, although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their
F25 0885 gentile counterparts,
F25 0890 they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed
F25 0900 Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-Jewish
F25 0910 world.   Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn College-
F25 0920 constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session- can
F25 0930 serve as a paradigm of the urban, lower-middle class Jewish student.
F25 0940    There is, to begin, an important sex difference. Typically, in
F25 0950 a lower-middle class Jewish family, a son will be sent to an out-of-town
F25 0960 school, if financial resources warrant it, while the daughter will
F25 0970 attend the local college. There are two reasons for this. First,
F25 0980 the girl's education has a lower priority than the son's. Second,
F25 0990 the attitude in Jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter
F25 1000 than toward the son. Most Jewish mothers are determined to exercise
F25 1010 vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by
F25 1020 keeping them home. The consequence of this is that the girls at Brooklyn
F25 1030 College outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically.
F25 1040 One can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town.
F25 1050    Brooklyn College students have an ambivalent attitude toward their
F25 1060 school. On the one hand, there is a sense of not having moved beyond
F25 1070 the ambiance of their high school. This is particularly acute for
F25 1080 those who attended Midwood High School directly across the street
F25 1090 from Brooklyn College. They have a sense of marginality at being denied
F25 1100 that special badge of status, the out-of-town school. At the same
F25 1110 time, there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good
F25 1120 college- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable
F25 1130 virtues- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling
F25 1140 that the college generates. "It's people of your own kind", a girl
F25 1150 remarked. "You don't have to watch what you say. Of course,
F25 1160 I would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds
F25 1170 of people, but I would want lots of Jewish kids there".   For
F25 1180 most Brooklyn College students, college is at once a perpetuation
F25 1190 of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood
F25 1200 and family. @rooklyn College is unequivocally Jewish in
F25 1210 tone, and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably
F25 1220 midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing. However, a
F25 1230 growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by
F25 1240 courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly
F25 1250 critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents. And
F25 1260 the rebellion of these third generation Jews is not the traditional
F25 1270 conflict of culture but, rather, a protest against a culture that they
F25 1280 view as softly and insidiously enveloping. "As long as I'm home,
F25 1290 I'll never grow up", a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly.
F25 1300 "They don't like it if I do anything away from home. It's so
F25 1310 much trouble, I don't usually bother".   For girls, the overprotection
F25 1320 is far more pervasive. Parents will drive on Friday night
F25 1330 to pick up their daughters after a sorority or House Plan meeting.
F25 1340 A freshman girl's father not too long ago called a dean at Brooklyn
F25 1350 College and demanded the "low-down" on a boy who was going out
F25 1360 with his daughter. The domestic tentacles even extend to the choice
F25 1370 of a major field. Under pressure from parents, the majority of Brooklyn
F25 1380 College girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with
F25 1390 marriage plans- limited graduate study requirement and convenient
F25 1400 working hours. This means that a great many academically talented girls
F25 1410 are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature.
F25 1420 A kind of double standard exists here for Jewish boys and girls
F25 1430 as it does in the realm of sex.   The breaking away from the prison
F25 1440 house of Brooklyn is gradual. First, the student trains on his
F25 1450 hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological
F25 1460 and sociological insights. Then, with the new affluence, there is
F25 1470 actually a sallying forth into the wide, wide world beyond the precincts
F25 1480 of New York. It is significant that the Catskills, which used to
F25 1490 be the summer playground for older teen-agers, a kind of summer suburb
F25 1500 of New York, no longer attracts them in great numbers- except for
F25 1510 those who work there as waiters, bus boys, or counselors in the day
F25 1520 camps. The great world beyond beckons. But it should be pointed out
F25 1530 that some of the new watering places- Fire Island, Nantucket, Westhampton,
F25 1540 Long Island, for example- tend to be homogeneously Jewish.
F25 1550 Although Brooklyn College does not yet have a junior-year-abroad
F25 1560 program, a good number of students spend summers in Europe. In
F25 1570 general, however, the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that
F25 1580 of the student at Harvard or Smith. And acculturation into the world
F25 1590 at large is likely to occur for the Brooklyn College student after
F25 1600 college rather than during the four school years.   Brooklyn
F25 1610 College is Marjorie Morningstar territory, as much as the Bronx or
F25 1620 Central Park West. There are hordes of nubile young women there
F25 1630 who, prodded by their impatient mothers, are determined to marry.
F25 1640 It is interesting that, although the percentage of married students
F25 1650 is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere- about 30 per
F25 1660 cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class-
F25 1670 the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate. "Almost
F25 1680 everybody in the senior class is married", students say dogmatically.
F25 1690 And the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities, sororities,
F25 1700 and houses (in the House Plan Association) that have good
F25 1710 news to impart. These announcements are, in effect, advertisements
F25 1720 for themselves as thriving marriage marts. There are boxed proclamations
F25 1730 in the newspaper of watchings, pinnings, ringings, engagements, and
F25 1740 marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity. "Witt House
F25 1750 happily announces the engagement of Fran Horowitz to Erwin Schwartz
F25 1760 of Fife House".   The Brooklyn College student shows
F25 1770 some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models. The Ivy
F25 1780 League enjoys no easy dominion here, and the boys are as likely to
F25 1790 dress in rather foppish Continental fashion, or even in nondescript
F25 1800 working class manner, as they are in the restrained, button-down Ivy
F25 1810 way. The girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts
F25 1820 out of town, and eye shadow, mascara, and elaborate <bouffant>
F25 1830 hairdos- despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel-
F25 1840 are not unknown even in early morning classes.   Among the
F25 1850 boys, there is very little bravado about drinking. Brooklyn College
F25 1860 is distinctive for not having an official drinking place. The Fort Lauderdale
F25 1870 encampment for drinking is foreign to most Brooklyn College
F25 1880 boys.
F26 0010 This should be used frequently (but shaken before using). For galled
F26 0020 breasts, the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard
F26 0030 enough white chalk to make a paste. This could also be used for any
F26 0040 other skin irritation. Or she might place cornstarch in the oven for
F26 0050 a short time and then apply this under her breasts.   "Female
F26 0060 troubles" of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the
F26 0070 frontier; at least I have only one remedy for anything of this kind
F26 0080 in my collection, one for hastening delayed menstruation. The sufferer
F26 0090 drinks tansy tea.   Bruises, burns, cuts, etc&, occurred frequently
F26 0100 on the frontier, and folk medicine gave the answers to these
F26 0110 problems too. Bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of
F26 0120 raw beefsteak. (Doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness
F26 0130 of the applications which relieved the pain.) Salted butter was
F26 0140 another
F26 0150 cure for bruises. Many people agreed that burns should be treated
F26 0160 with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard, but one informant
F26 0170 told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water; the burn oozed
F26 0180 watery fluid for many days, and finally the healing was completed by
F26 0190 bathing it with epsom salts. Another swore by vinegar baths for burns,
F26 0200 and still another recommended salted butter. "Butter salve" or
F26 0210 "butter ointment" was used for burns, and for bruises as well. This
F26 0220 was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil;
F26 0230 when it was cool, the fat was skimmed off and bottled. Cow's
F26 0240 milk was another cure for burns, and burns covered with gum arabic or
F26 0250 plain mucilage healed quickly. One man, badly burned about the face and
F26 0260 eyes by an arc welding torch, was blinded and could not find a doctor
F26 0270 at the time. A sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings,
F26 0280 which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the "heat".
F26 0290 Later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns. The results
F26 0300 were good, but which treatment helped is still not known.   To
F26 0310 stop bleeding, cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds. One old-timer
F26 0320 said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut, even when on a knuckle, if it
F26 0330 was made by a rusty tool; this would stop the flow and also prevent
F26 0340 infection. My lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy
F26 0350 for cuts and wounds; she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury
F26 0360 and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth, over which she poured
F26 0370 turpentine. He showed me one of his fingers which had been practically
F26 0380 amputated and which his mother had treated; there is scarcely a scar
F26 0390 showing. Tobacco was common first aid. A "chaw" of tobacco put
F26 0400 on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing. Or a thin slice
F26 0410 of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing. One
F26 0420 old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a
F26 0430 fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his
F26 0440 head. His brother ran a mile to get the father; when they reached
F26 0450 the boy, the father sliced a new plug of tobacco, put the scalp back
F26 0460 in place, and covered the raw edges with the slices. Then he put a rag
F26 0470 around the dressing to keep it in place. There was no cleaning or further
F26 0480 care, but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no
F26 0490 scar. Veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding,
F26 0500 and rue was an antiseptic. Until quite recently, "sterile" maggots
F26 0510 could be bought to apply to a wound; they would feed on its surface,
F26 0520 leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated.   Tetanus
F26 0530 could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound. One family
F26 0540 bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips, or, if these were not
F26 0550 handy, plain lard. Another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the
F26 0560 wounded foot or hand in the smoke. Rabies were cured or prevented
F26 0570 by "madstones" which the pioneer wore or carried. In 1872 there were
F26 0580 known to be twenty-two in Norton County, and one had been in the
F26 0590 family for 200 years. Another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds,
F26 0600 then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker.   While nowadays
F26 0610 we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at
F26 0620 the nose, not long ago a nosebleed was simply that, and treatment had
F26 0630 little
F26 0640 variation. Since a fall or blow might have caused it, a cold pack
F26 0650 was usually first aid. This might be applied to the top of the nose
F26 0660 or the back of the neck, pressed on the upper lip, or inserted into the
F26 0670 nostril (cotton was usually used in this last). Nosebleed could be
F26 0680 stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient's neck and
F26 0690 tying in it a knot for each year of his life. Or the victim could chew
F26 0700 hard on a piece of paper, meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in
F26 0710 his ears.   Old sores could be healed by the constant application
F26 0720 of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water. Blood blisters could
F26 0730 be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with
F26 0750 any hard nonpoisonous substance. Felons were cured by taking common
F26 0760 salt and drying it in the oven, pounding it fine, and mixing it with equal
F26 0770 parts of spirits of turpentine; this mixture was then spread on
F26 0780 a cloth and wrapped around the affected part. As the cloth dried, more
F26 0790 of the mixture was applied, and after twenty-four hours the felon was
F26 0800 supposed to be "killed".   Insect bites were cured in many
F26 0810 ways. Many an old-timer swore by the saliva method; "get a bite,
F26 0820 spit on it" was a proverb. This was used also for bruises. Yellow
F26 0830 clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings;
F26 0840 not long ago "Denver Mud" was most popular. Chiggers were a
F26 0850 common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived; so
F26 0860 small as to be scarcely visible to the eye, they buried themselves in
F26 0870 the victim's flesh. Bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief
F26 0880 and also killed the pests. Ant bites were eased by applying liquid
F26 0890 bluing. For mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half
F26 0900 a glass of soda was made. For wasp stings onion juice, obtained by
F26 0910 scraping an onion, gave quick relief. A handier remedy was to bathe the
F26 0920 painful part in strong soapy water; mud was sometimes used as well
F26 0930 as soap. Just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve
F26 0940 wasp or bee stings.   Bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days;
F26 0950 to keep them out of homes, even in the 1900's, was a chore. Bed
F26 0960 slats were washed in alum water, legs of beds were placed in cups
F26 0970 of kerosene, and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate,
F26 0980 applied with a feather. Kerosene was very effective in ridding
F26 0990 pioneer homes of the pests. At times pioneer children got lice in their
F26 1000 hair. A kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment, but it did the
F26 1010 job.   To remove an insect from one's ear warm water should
F26 1020 be inserted. A cinder or other small object could be removed from the
F26 1030 eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye. As the seed swelled its glutinous
F26 1040 covering protected the eyeball from irritation, and both the cinder
F26 1050 and the seed could soon be washed out. Another way to remove small
F26 1060 objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed; the particle
F26 1070 would then move toward the nose, where it could be wiped out with
F26 1080 a wisp of cotton.   Shingles were cured by gentian, an old drug,
F26 1090 used in combinations. For erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and
F26 1100 one
F26 1110 ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth. Itching
F26 1120 skin, considered "just nerves", was eased by treating with
F26 1130 whiskey and salt. Winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider
F26 1140 in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped. To cure fungus growths
F26 1150 on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of
F26 1160 sassafras bark in a quart of water. They drank half a cup of this morning
F26 1170 and night, and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same
F26 1180 solution. Six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and
F26 1190 had defied other remedies. Frostbite was treated by putting the feet
F26 1200 and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow. Now one hears that
F26 1210 heat and hot water are used instead. Another remedy was oil of eucalyptus,
F26 1220 used as well for chilblains. Chilblains were also treated with
F26 1230 tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves.   Boils have always been
F26 1240 a source of much trouble. A German informant gave me a sure cure
F26 1250 made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice. Another poultice
F26 1260 was made from the inner bark of the elm tree, steeped in water
F26 1270 until it formed a sticky, gummy solution. This was also used for sores.
F26 1280 Another frequent pioneer difficulty, caused by wearing rough and heavy
F26 1290 shoes and boots, was corns. One veracious woman tells me she has
F26 1300 used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they
F26 1310 remove the pain or "fire". Another common cure was to soak the
F26 1320 feet five or ten minutes in warm water, then to apply a solution of
F26 1330 equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight.
F26 1340 This softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed
F26 1350 the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on.
F26 1360    There were many cures for warts. One young girl told me how her
F26 1370 mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in
F26 1380 vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several
F26 1390 times. Another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a
F26 1400 bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the
F26 1410 house for seven days. Saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's
F26 1420 sleep was considered poisonous; wetting a wart with this saliva on
F26 1430 wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear
F26 1440 after only a few treatments, and strangely enough many warts did
F26 1450 just that. One wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy.
F26 1460 Another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours, tie
F26 1470 it on the wart, and wear it for a week. A simpler method was to tie
F26 1480 a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way. I
F26 1490 know this worked. One person recommended to me washing the wart with
F26 1500 sulphur water; another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato
F26 1510 three times daily. Another common method was to cut an onion in two and
F26 1520 place each half on the wart for a moment; the onion was then fastened
F26 1530 together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave. As the
F26 1540 onion decayed, so did the wart.   Sore muscles were relieved by
F26 1550 an arnica rub; sore feet by calf's-foot, an herb from the pioneer's
F26 1560 ubiquitous herb garden, or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water
F26 1570 in which two cups of salt had been dissolved. Leg cramps, one person
F26 1580 tells me, were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the
F26 1590 body on the heel and pressing down hard. This does give relief, as I
F26 1600 can testify. One doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy
F26 1610 before each meal for leg cramps. Pains in the back of the leg and in
F26 1620 the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope
F26 1630 about the patient's waist.   For sprains and swellings, one
F26 1640 pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added
F26 1650 to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief.
F27 0010    EXCEPT FOR the wine waiter in a restaurant- always an inscrutable
F27 0020 plenipotentiary unto himself, the genii with the keys to unlock
F27 0030 the gates of the wine world are one's dealer, and the foreign shipper
F27 0040 or <negociant> who in turn supplies him. In instances where
F27 0050 both of these are persons or firms with integrity, the situation is ideal.
F27 0060 It may, on occasion, be anything but that. However, by cultivating
F27 0070 a wine dealer and accepting his advice, one will soon enough ascertain
F27 0080 whether he has any knowledge of wines (as opposed to what he may
F27 0090 have been told by salesmen and promoters) and, better yet, whether he
F27 0100 has a taste for wine. Again, by spreading one's purchases over several
F27 0110 wine dealers, one becomes familiar with the names and specialties
F27 0120 of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad. This is important because,
F27 0130 despite all the efforts of the French government, an appreciable
F27 0140 segment of France's export trade in wines is still tainted with a
F27 0150 misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty, and there are many
F27 0160 too many <negociants> who would rather turn a <sou> than amass a
F27 0170 creditable reputation overseas.   A good <negociant> or shipper
F27 0180 will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from
F27 0190 the best vineyards, or the best parts of them; he may also be the
F27 0200 one who makes and bottles the best blends- sound wines from vineyards
F27 0210 generally in his own district. These are the wines the French themselves
F27 0220 use for everyday drinking, for even in France virtually no one
F27 0230 drinks the <Grands Crus> on a meal-to-meal basis. The <Grands
F27 0240 Crus> are expensive, and even doting palates tire of them. And certainly,
F27 0250 in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine
F27 0260 drinker, the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready
F27 0270 for the <Grands Crus> as a steady diet without frequent recourse
F27 0280 to <crus> of less renown. There is nothing <infra dig> about a
F27 0290 good blend from a good shipper. Some of them are very delicious indeed,
F27 0300 and there are many good ones exported- unfortunately, along with
F27 0310 others not so good, and worse. Consultation with a reputable wine dealer
F27 0320 and constant experimentation- "steering ever from the known to
F27 0330 the unknown"- are the requisites.   Wine waiters are something
F27 0340 else again; especially if one is travelling or dining out a great
F27 0350 deal, their importance mounts. Most of them, the world over, operate
F27 0360 on the same principle by which justice is administered in France and
F27 0370 some other Latin countries: the customer is to be considered guilty
F27 0380 of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise, with the burden of proof
F27 0390 on the customer himself. Now the drinking of wine (and happily so!)
F27 0400 is for the most part a recondite affair, for manifestly, if everyone
F27 0410 in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them, the
F27 0420 supply would dry up in no time at all. This is the only valid, and extenuating,
F27 0430 argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible
F27 0440 attitude of the common wine waiter. A really good wine waiter is,
F27 0450 paradoxically, the guardian (and not the purveyor) of his cellar against
F27 0460 the Visigoths. Faced, on the one hand, with an always exhaustible
F27 0470 supply of his best wines, and on the other by a clientele usually equipped
F27 0480 with inexhaustible pocketbooks, it is a wonder indeed that all wine
F27 0490 waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence. The one way to
F27 0500 get around them- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking
F27 0510 to it- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter
F27 0520 is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending
F27 0530 money. Only then, perhaps, will he reveal his jewels and his bargains.
F27 0540    Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest
F27 0550 for several weeks before it is served. This is especially true of
F27 0560 red wines, and a practice which, though not always practicable, is well
F27 0570 worth the effort. It does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter
F27 0580 of days, but in terms of months and years it is fatal. Wine stored
F27 0590 for a long time should be on its side; otherwise, the cork dries
F27 0600 and air enters to spoil it. When stacking wine on its side in a bin,
F27 0610 care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next
F27 0620 to the cork. Fat bottles, such as Burgundies, have a way of rolling
F27 0630 around in the bin and often need little props, such as a bit of cardboard
F27 0640 or a chip of wood, to hold them in the proper reclining posture.
F27 0650 Too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks, again with ill effects.
F27 0660 The best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine (provided the eye
F27 0670 has not already spotted it) is to smell the wet end of the cork after
F27 0680 pulling it: if it smells of wine, the bottle is probably all right;
F27 0690 if it smells of cork, one has grounds for suspicion.   Seasonal
F27 0700 rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine: they age it prematurely.
F27 0710 The ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five
F27 0720 degrees, with an allowable range of five degrees above or below
F27 0730 this, provided there are no sudden or frequent changes. Prolonged vibration
F27 0740 is also undesirable; consequently, one's wine closet or cellar
F27 0750 should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces. If
F27 0760 one lives near a subway or an express parkway, the solution is to have
F27 0770 one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time.
F27 0780 Light, especially daylight, is always bad for wine.   All in
F27 0790 all, though, there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations
F27 0800 thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking; many people go
F27 0810 to extreme lengths in decanting, chilling or warming, or banishing without
F27 0820 further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious
F27 0830 cork. No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure
F27 0840 they derive from all this, and to give fair warning where warning
F27 0850 is due, no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree
F27 0860 of purism! But the fact remains that in most restaurants, including
F27 0870 some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon, the bottle
F27 0880 is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered,
F27 0890 and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place
F27 0900 while the chef is preparing the meal. A white wine, already at cool
F27 0910 cellar temperature, may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and
F27 0920 water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator (the former is far
F27 0930 preferable) in about fifteen minutes; for those who live in a winter
F27 0940 climate, there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow. Though
F27 0950 by no means an ideal procedure, a red wine may similarly be brought
F27 0960 from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so
F27 0970 before serving time. It may be a bit cold when poured; but again,
F27 0980 as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt, wine should
F27 0990 be served in a large, tulip-shaped glass, which is never filled more
F27 1000 than half full. In this way, red wine warms of itself quite rapidly-
F27 1010 and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste
F27 1020 and fragrance until after the middle of the meal (or the course), in
F27 1030 the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting
F27 1040 stages. The only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming
F27 1050 a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an
F27 1060 open fire. This invariably effaces any wine's character, and drives
F27 1070 its fragrance underground.   It should not be forgotten that
F27 1080 wines mature fastest in half-bottles, less fast in full bottles, slowly
F27 1090 in Magnums- and slower yet in Tregnums, double Magnums, Jeroboams,
F27 1100 Methuselahs, and Imperiales, respectively. Very old red wines
F27 1110 often require several hours of aeration, and any red wine, brought from
F27 1120 the cellar within half an hour of mealtime, should be uncorked and allowed
F27 1130 some air. But white wines never! White wines should be opened
F27 1140 when served, having been previously chilled in proportion to their
F27 1150 sweetness. Thus, Sauternes or Barsacs should be very cold; a Pouilly-Fuisse
F27 1160 or a Chablis somewhat less cold. Over-chilling is an accepted
F27 1170 method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white
F27 1180 wine, especially a dry wine- and certainly less of a crime than serving
F27 1190 a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive.
F27 1200 The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death
F27 1210 when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air. To quote
F27 1220 Professor Saintsbury: "The last glass of claret or Burgundy
F27 1230 is as good as the first; but the first glass of Chateau d'Yquem
F27 1240 or Montrachet is a great deal better than the last"! This does not
F27 1250 mean, though, that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration: there
F27 1260 is a reasonable limit- and wines kept over to the next meal or
F27 1270 the next day, after they have once been opened, are never as good. If
F27 1280 this must be done, they should always be corked and kept in a cool place;
F27 1290 it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably
F27 1300 shorter than those of milk.   A few red wines, notably those
F27 1310 of the Beaujolais, are better consumed at cellar temperature. By
F27 1320 tradition, a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature-
F27 1330 if anything a little cooler- and be aged enough for the tannin
F27 1340 and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well. Thus,
F27 1350 red wine must, if possible, never be disturbed or shaken; very old
F27 1360 red wine is often decanted so that the puckering, bitter elements which
F27 1370 have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself.
F27 1380 A tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may
F27 1390 do as much harm as a week at sea. The cork should be pulled gradually
F27 1400 and smoothly, and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward.   Many
F27 1410 people use wicker cradles for old red wine, lifting the bottle carefully
F27 1420 from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table, without
F27 1430 disturbing the sediment. Another school frowns on such a shortcut, and
F27 1440 insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand
F27 1450 on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom,
F27 1460 after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position
F27 1470 on its side in the cradle.   In France, when one wishes to entertain
F27 1480 at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines, one visits the
F27 1490 restaurant well ahead of time, chooses the wines and, with the advice
F27 1500 of the manager and his chef, builds the menu around them. The wine
F27 1510 waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened
F27 1520 at least in time to warm and aerate, preferably allowed to stand on
F27 1530 end for as long as possible and, perhaps in the case of very old wines,
F27 1540 be decanted. Decanting old wine aerates it fully; it may also be-
F27 1550 practically speaking- a matter of good economy. For, in the process
F27 1560 of decanting, the bottle is only tilted once instead of several
F27 1570 or more times at the table: hence, a minimum of the undesirable mixture
F27 1580 of wine and dregs.   Though there are many exceptions, which
F27 1590 we have noted in preceding pages, white wine is as a rule best consumed
F27 1600 between two and six years old, and red wines, nowadays, between three
F27 1610 and ten. Red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep
F27 1620 longer; the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite
F27 1630 number, red Burgundy. Some clarets do not come into their own until
F27 1640 they are ten or fifteen years of age, or even more. If a red Bordeaux
F27 1650 of a good name and year is bitter or acid, or cloying and muddy-tasting,
F27 1660 leave it alone for a while. Most of the wines of Beaujolais, on
F27 1670 the other hand, <should> be drunk while very young; and Alsatians
F27 1680 <may> be.
F28 0010 Giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically: "Rest assured that
F28 0020 your accompanying Letter of Instructions shall be in the Letter
F28 0030 and Spirit strictly complied with **h and most particularly in regard
F28 0040 to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane
F28 0050 views".   Giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation.
F28 0060 The slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under John Palfrey's
F28 0070 overseer. An excellent crop was expected that year.
F28 0075 William,
F28 0080 who lived in neighboring St& Mary's parish, had taken charge and
F28 0090 decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated
F28 0100 for another year. Giffen advised acceptance of this plan, citing the
F28 0110 depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions
F28 0120 at the plantation. If sold then, the land and improvements might
F28 0130 bring only $5,000. Early in January, 1844 he had a conference with
F28 0140 Henry and William in New Orleans, and upon learning of Gorham's
F28 0150 intention, Henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother.
F28 0160 The emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs,
F28 0170 he contended, but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless
F28 0180 Negroes. They were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation,
F28 0190 and Louisiana law required their removal from the state. Gorham
F28 0200 refused to accept money for slave property, but did he realize how
F28 0210 much expense and trouble the transportation of his Negroes to the
F28 0220 North involved? The suggestion that Giffen hire out the slaves was
F28 0230 not realistic, since no planter would take the risk of having Negroes
F28 0240 who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves. Henry hid
F28 0250 his annoyance, although both he and William were furious with their
F28 0260 Yankee brother. William, who did not write to Gorham, told Giffen
F28 0270 that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year, he would
F28 0280 sue "amicably" to protect his interests.   Palfrey was
F28 0285 determined
F28 0290 that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers
F28 0300 during the transition period before emancipation. If William wished
F28 0310 to continue operations for a year, why not simply leave the Negroes
F28 0320 undisturbed and pay them "as high wages to remain there as are ever
F28 0330 paid the labor of persons of their sex + age. A disposition to exert
F28 0340 themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them
F28 0350 **h to come into the scheme. Their having family ties on our plantation
F28 0360 + the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement". When he heard
F28 0370 of his brothers' anger, Palfrey was still hopeful that they could
F28 0380 be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages. If not, he was willing
F28 0390 to accede to William's wishes in any way that did not block
F28 0400 his ultimate aim. William was adamant on one point: under no circumstances
F28 0410 would he allow the Negroes to remain on the plantation with his
F28 0420 and Henry's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom. Knowing
F28 0430 the antipathy that existed in Louisiana against increasing the
F28 0440 number of free Negroes, Giffen suggested that Palfrey bring them
F28 0450 to Boston at once, and then send them on to Liberia. Lacking specific
F28 0460 instructions, he agreed to William's condition.   In March
F28 0470 there was a division of the slaves, and Giffen carried out his instructions
F28 0480 as nearly as possible. Of the fifty-two slaves, Giffen succeeded
F28 0490 in getting a lot of twenty, twelve of whom were females. "I considered
F28 0500 that your views would be best carried out", he explained,
F28 0510 "by taking women whose progeny will of course be free + more fully extend
F28 0520 the philantrophy of Emancipation. I have also taken the old servants
F28 0530 of your father as a matter of Conscience + Justice". The ages
F28 0540 of the slaves ranged from sixty-five, for an old house servant, to
F28 0550 an unnamed newborn child. If Palfrey ever had any doubts about the
F28 0560 wickedness of slavery, they were put aside after he received an inventory
F28 0570 of the slave property he had inherited. This cold reckoning of human
F28 0580 worth in a legal paper, devoid of compassion or humanity, was all
F28 0590 he needed. Each human being, known only by a given name, had a cash value.
F28 0600 Old Sam's sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150;
F28 0610 Rose, a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential, was worth $400.
F28 0620 In rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property, Palfrey
F28 0630 was giving up close to $7,000.   Palfrey's brothers each received
F28 0640 lots of sixteen Negroes, and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed
F28 0650 that all lots were to be valued at $6,666.66. Thus twenty "black
F28 0660 souls" were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land
F28 0670 of free men. Giffen extracted one concession from William: the house
F28 0680 servants could be free at any time Gorham thought expedient.
F28 0690    Despite Giffen's warning, Palfrey still had plans for freeing
F28 0700 his slaves in Louisiana. Yet even if he could get the necessary approval,
F28 0710 fourteen of his Negroes could not be manumitted without special
F28 0720 permission. According to state law a slave had to be at least thirty
F28 0730 years old before he could be freed. Palfrey petitioned the state legislature
F28 0740 to waive the requirement. Otherwise, freedom would mean removal
F28 0750 from the state in which "as the place of their past residence from
F28 0760 birth, or for many years, it would **h be materially for their advantage
F28 0770 to be at liberty to remain". On March 11 the Louisiana legislature
F28 0780 voted unanimously to table the petition. News of the legislative
F28 0790 veto appeared in the New Orleans papers, and Henry and William
F28 0800 became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt
F28 0810 in advance. Henry stormed into Giffen's office waving a copy of
F28 0820 the New Orleans <Courier,> shouting that the emancipation scheme
F28 0830 had become a public affair, and that it would reach the "Ears of the
F28 0840 People on the Plantation, and make them restless + unhappy".
F28 0850    His brothers' anger caused Palfrey genuine concern, for he had
F28 0860 imposed a dual mission upon himself: to free his slaves, and to keep
F28 0870 the family from falling apart over the issue. When Giffen decided
F28 0880 to charge him interest on the loan from John Palfrey, Gorham readily
F28 0890 assented, vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents, his brothers
F28 0900 would never have any cause to complain of him.   in view of these
F28 0910 difficulties, Palfrey decided to go to Louisiana. Giffen had already
F28 0920 urged him to journey south, if only for a few days to clear up matters.
F28 0930 His duties as Massachusetts Secretary of State obliged him
F28 0940 to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-April. Palfrey
F28 0950 told his wife of his intentions for the first time, and left for New
F28 0960 Orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of Providence
F28 0970 that he might be allowed to see his family again.   During his journey
F28 0980 Palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists. In both cases he
F28 0990 desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived
F28 1000 in the North. In New York, Lydia Maria Child welcomed him
F28 1010 enthusiastically: "I have lately heard of you from the Legislature
F28 1020 of Louisiana, and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood
F28 1030 of man". Mrs& Child, who had once apologized for sending
F28 1040 editor Palfrey a book on slavery, now confided that she had helped one
F28 1050 of Henry Palfrey's slaves escape to Canada some years before,
F28 1060 but asked him not to advertise the fact in Louisiana. She agreed to
F28 1070 take charge of five or six of the Negroes should Palfrey decide to send
F28 1080 them north immediately. At Lexington, Kentucky, Palfrey consulted
F28 1090 with Cassius M& Clay on the same subject, but with no apparent
F28 1100 result.   Despite his apprehensions about his personal safety,
F28 1110 Palfrey's reception in New Orleans was more than cordial. Instead
F28 1120 of the expected "annoyances" due to the nature of his mission,
F28 1130 he received many calling cards and invitations from "gentlemen of mark,
F28 1140 on whom I had no sort of claim, + have had many more invitations
F28 1150 than I could accept". He later told abolitionist Edmund Quincy of
F28 1160 the "marked attention and civility" with which the New Orleans
F28 1170 gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him. The memory of this southern
F28 1180 hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years
F28 1190 and Civil War. Palfrey's autobiography contains a melodramatic
F28 1200 account of two perilous days spent among the planters of Attakapas,
F28 1210 "many of whom were coarse + passionate people, much excited by what
F28 1220 they heard of my plans". He proceeded with his task bravely- in
F28 1230 his memoirs, at least- before the "passions of my neighbors should
F28 1240 have time to boil too high".   Palfrey had already made up his
F28 1250 mind that he would allow the men, but not the women, to choose freely
F28 1260 whether or not to go North for freedom. The women by remaining behind
F28 1270 condemned their children, born and unborn, to bondage. He had a
F28 1280 short private talk with each adult slave. Only one objected, but Palfrey
F28 1290 soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others. All the
F28 1300 slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure
F28 1310 until the end of the planting season, so that they could get in "their
F28 1320 own little produce". Palfrey agreed; the slaves were to remain
F28 1330 as wage laborers for his account. William's threat that under
F28 1340 no conditions would he allow "freedom-conscious" slaves to mix with
F28 1350 his own was not carried out, for the plantation continued in operation
F28 1360 as before. Palfrey returned to Massachusetts greatly relieved to
F28 1370 have made an arrangement "so satisfactory to my judgment + my conscience".
F28 1380    From Cambridge, Palfrey maintained a close interest
F28 1390 in the welfare of his slaves. In fact, as the time for their departure
F28 1400 approached, his solicitousness increased. Should any slave change
F28 1410 his mind and request to leave earlier, Giffen was to provide passage
F28 1420 at once. When a sailing date of March, 1845 was finally
F28 1430 established,
F28 1440 Palfrey made sure that the Negroes would have comfortable quarters
F28 1450 in New Orleans and aboard ship. Giffen assured him that the captain
F28 1460 and his mate had personally promised to treat the Negroes with consideration.
F28 1470 Palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage
F28 1480 to pay for their labor throughout 1844. The plantation was sold in January,
F28 1490 1845, and Palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people
F28 1500 two months' wages. Giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation
F28 1510 for a year's work; the new owner at Attakapas declined to
F28 1520 enter into any philanthropic arrangement.   On March 21, 1845 the
F28 1530 bark <Bashaw> weighed anchor at New Orleans, while on the levee
F28 1540 Henry and William Palfrey waved farewell to their father's former
F28 1550 chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled
F28 1560 regret and jubilation.   Not all of Palfrey's slaves were
F28 1570 aboard the <Bashaw>. Giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult
F28 1580 to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants. Two of
F28 1590 these were included in Palfrey's lot. Giffen filed a petition for
F28 1600 permission to emancipate four slaves (all more than fifty years old)
F28 1610 with the St& Martin's Parish Police Jury. After an initial rejection,
F28 1620 which he attributed to a "general Excitement against Abolition
F28 1630 and Emancipation", Giffen bribed the right individuals on the
F28 1640 jury, and got the permission without further delay.   When the
F28 1650 Negroes landed at Boston a month later they were, of course, no longer
F28 1660 slaves. Slavery was prohibited in Massachusetts by the terms of
F28 1670 the constitution of 1780, which declared "all men are born free and
F28 1680 equal". Nevertheless, Palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at King's
F28 1690 Chapel to formalize the emancipation. An eyewitness recalled
F28 1700 how awkward the red-turbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed
F28 1710 in the church doorway, and the diffidence the former slaves displayed
F28 1720 while they listened to the few words that declared them free.
F28 1730    Once the question of emancipation was settled to Palfrey's satisfaction,
F28 1740 he faced a real problem in placing the freedmen in suitable homes
F28 1750 as servants. Palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a Negro boy in
F28 1760 the Hopedale Community, but he had better luck in his other attempts.
F28 1770 Mrs& Child, true to her word, helped place Anna and her four children
F28 1775 with a Quaker
F28 1780 family named Hathaway near Canandaigua, New York.
F28 1790 This group had been Palfrey's greatest worry since Anna was
F28 1800 in bad health, and her children were too young to work for their keep.
F29 0010    But certainly the New Frontier has brought to Washington a
F29 0020 group more varied in background and interest. Secretary of State Dean
F29 0030 Rusk, a former Rhodes Scholar and Mills College dean, has headed
F29 0040 the Rockefeller Foundation and in that role expended large sums for
F29 0050 international cultural exchange. One of his initial acts in office
F29 0060 was to appoint Philip Coombs of the Ford Foundation as the first
F29 0070 Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs.
F29 0080 ("In the late forties and fifties", Coombs has declared in defining
F29 0090 his role, "two strong new arms were added to reinforce United
F29 0100 States foreign policy **h economic assistance and military assistance.
F29 0110 As we embark upon the sixties we have an opportunity **h to build
F29 0120 a third strong arm, aimed at the development of people, at the fuller
F29 0130 realization of their creative human potential, and at better understanding
F29 0140 among them".)   Many of the new appointees are art collectors.
F29 0150 Ambassador-at-Large Averell Harriman has returned to the capital
F29 0160 with a collection of paintings that include Renoir, Cezanne, Gauguin,
F29 0170 Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas, Matisse, Picasso, and
F29 0180 Walt Kuhn. The Director of the Peace Corps, R& Sargent Shriver,
F29 0190 Jr&, a Kennedy brother-in-law, collects heavily among the moderns,
F29 0200 including Kenzo Okada and Josef Albers. Secretary of the Treasury
F29 0210 Douglas Dillon owns a prize Monet, <Femmes dans un jardin>.
F29 0220    Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, former President
F29 0230 of the Ford Motor Company, comes from a generation different from
F29 0240 that of Eisenhower's own first Secretary of Defense, Charles Wilson,
F29 0250 who had been head of General Motors. Unlike Wilson, who at
F29 0260 times seemed almost anti-intellectual in his earthy pragmatism. McNamara
F29 0270 is the scholar-businessman. An inveterate reader of books, he chose
F29 0280 while working in Detroit to live in the University community of
F29 0290 Ann Arbor, almost forty miles away. He selected as Comptroller of
F29 0300 Defense, not a veteran accountant, but a former Rhodes Scholar, Charles
F29 0310 Hitch, who is author of a study on <The Economics of Defense
F29 0320 in the Nuclear Age>.   One of the President's special assistants,
F29 0330 the Harvard dean McGeorge Bundy, was co-author with Henry
F29 0340 L& Stimson of the latter's classic memoir, <On Active Service>.
F29 0350 Another, Arthur M& Schlesinger, Jr&, has won a Pulitzer
F29 0360 Prize in history; his wife, Marion, is a portrait painter. The
F29 0370 Press Secretary, Pierre Salinger, was a child prodigy as a pianist.
F29 0380 ("It is always of sorrow to me when I find people who **h neither
F29 0390 know nor understand music", he declared not long ago in proposing
F29 0400 that White House prizes be awarded for music and art.) Mrs& Arthur
F29 0410 Goldberg, wife of the Secretary of Labor, paints professionally
F29 0420 and helps sponsor the Associated Artists' Gallery in the District
F29 0430 of Columbia. ("Artists are always at a new frontier", she claims.
F29 0440 "In fact, the search is almost more important than the find".)
F29 0450 Mrs& Henry Labouisse, wife of the new director of the foreign
F29 0460 aid program, is the writer and lecturer Eve Curie.   The list
F29 0470 goes on. At last count, sixteen former Rhodes Scholars (see box on
F29 0480 page 13) had been appointed to the Administration, second in number
F29 0490 only to its Harvard graduates. Besides Schlesinger, the Justice Department's
F29 0500 Information Director, Edwin Guthman, has won a Pulitzer
F29 0510 Prize (for national reporting). Postmaster General J& Edward
F29 0520 Day, who must deal with matters of postal censorship, is himself
F29 0530 author of a novel, <Bartholf Street,> albeit one he was obliged to
F29 0540 publish
F29 0550 at his own expense.   Two men show promise of playing prominent
F29 0560 roles:   William Walton, a writer-turned-painter, has
F29 0570 been a long-time friend of the President. They arrived in Washington
F29 0580 about the same time during the early postwar years: Kennedy as the
F29 0590 young Congressman from Massachusetts; Walton, after a wartime stint
F29 0600 with <Time-Life>, to become bureau chief for the <New Republic>.
F29 0610 Both lived in Georgetown, were unattached, and shared an active
F29 0620 social life. Walton, who soon made a break from journalism to become
F29 0630 one of the capital's leading semi-abstract painters, vows that he
F29 0640 and Kennedy never once discussed art in those days. Nonetheless, they
F29 0650 found common interests. During last year's campaign, Kennedy asked
F29 0660 Walton, an utter novice in organization politics, to assist him.
F29 0670 Walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the
F29 0680 hard-fought Wisconsin primary and proved so useful that he was promoted
F29 0690 to be liaison officer to critically important New York City.
F29 0700    Walton, who served as a correspondent with General James Gavin's
F29 0710 paratroopers during the invasion of France, combines the soul
F29 0720 of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy. He provoked outraged editorials
F29 0730 when, after a post-Inaugural inspection of the White House
F29 0740 with Mrs& Kennedy, he remarked to reporters, "We just cased the
F29 0750 joint to see what was there". But his credentials are impeccable.
F29 0760 Already the President and the First Lady have deputized him to advise
F29 0770 on matters ranging from the furnishing of the White House to the
F29 0780 renovation of Lafayette Square. A man of great talent, he will continue
F29 0790 to serve as a sort of Presidential trouble-shooter, strictly ex
F29 0800 officio, for culture.   A more official representative is the Secretary
F29 0810 of the Interior. Udall, who comes from one of the Mormon
F29 0820 first-families of Arizona, is a bluff, plain-spoken man with a lust
F29 0830 for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight.
F29 0840 But even while sparring furiously with Republican politicians, he displays
F29 0850 a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments.
F29 0860 His private dining room has become a way station for visiting intellectuals
F29 0870 such as C& P& Snow, Arnold Toynbee, and Aaron Copland.
F29 0880    Udall argues that Interior affairs should cover a great
F29 0890 deal more than dams and wildlife preserves. After promoting Frost's
F29 0900 appearance at the Inauguration, he persuaded the poet to return
F29 0910 several months later to give a reading to a select audience of Cabinet
F29 0920 members, members of Congress, and other Washington notables gathered
F29 0930 in the State Department auditorium. The event was so successful
F29 0940 that the Interior Secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar
F29 0950 ones from time to time, hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment
F29 0960 of the Administration.   His Ideas in this respect, however,
F29 0970 sometimes arouse critical response. One tempest was stirred up last
F29 0980 March when Udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue
F29 0990 of William Jennings Bryan, sculpted by the late Gutzon Borglum,
F29 1000 would be sent "on indefinite loan" to Salem, Illinois, Bryan's
F29 1010 birthplace. Spokesmen for the nation's tradition-minded sculptors
F29 1020 promptly claimed that Udall was exiling the statue because of his
F29 1030 own hostility to this art form. They dug up a speech he had made two
F29 1040 years earlier as a Congressman, decrying the more than two hundred
F29 1050 statues, monuments, and memorials which "dot the Washington landscape
F29 1060 **h as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching
F29 1070 new plans". Hoping to cut down on such works, Udall had proposed
F29 1080 that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized.
F29 1090    He is not likely to win this battle easily. In the
F29 1100 case of the Borglum statue an Interior aide was obliged to announce
F29 1110 that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Secretary had no
F29 1120 desire to "hustle" it out of Washington. The last Congress adopted
F29 1130 seven bills for memorials, including one to Taras Shevchenko,
F29 1140 the Ukrainian poet laureate; eleven others were introduced. Active
F29 1150 warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first
F29 1160 Roosevelt on Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac, and T&
F29 1170 R&'s own living children, who wish to preserve the island as
F29 1180 a wildlife sanctuary. The hotly debated plan for the capital's Franklin
F29 1190 D& Roosevelt Memorial, a circle of huge tablets engraved with
F29 1200 his speeches (and promptly dubbed by one of its critics, "Instant
F29 1210 Stonehenge"), is another of Udall's headaches, since as supervisor
F29 1220 of the National Parks Commission he will share in the responsibility
F29 1230 for building it.   "Washington", President Kennedy
F29 1240 has been heard to remark ironically, "is a city of southern efficiency
F29 1250 and northern charm". There have been indications that he hopes
F29 1260 to redress that situation, commencing with the White House. One of
F29 1270 Mrs& Kennedy's initial concerns as First Lady was the sad state
F29 1280 of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national
F29 1290 shrine. Ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture
F29 1300 assembled by President Thomas Jefferson, the White House has collected
F29 1310 a hodgepodge of period pieces, few of them authentic or aesthetic.
F29 1320    Mrs& Kennedy shows a determination to change all this.
F29 1330 Not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk, hewed from
F29 1340 the timbers of the British ship H&M&S& <Resolute> and
F29 1345 presented to
F29 1350 President Hayes by Queen Victoria. It now serves the President
F29 1360 in his oval office. Later, browsing in an old issue of the
F29 1370 <Gazette des Beaux-Arts,> she found a description of a handsome gilt
F29 1380 pier-table purchased in 1817 by President James Monroe. She traced
F29 1390 it to a storage room. With its coating of gold radiator paint removed-
F29 1400 a gaucherie of some earlier tenant- it will now occupy its
F29 1410 rightful place in the oval Blue Room on the first floor of the White
F29 1420 House.   But it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century
F29 1430 furniture (which Mrs& Kennedy feels is the proper period
F29 1440 for
F29 1450 the White House) must be pursued in places other than government storage
F29 1460 rooms.
F29 1470 The First Lady appointed a Fine Arts Advisory Committee
F29 1480 for the White House, to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange
F29 1490 ways to acquire them. Her effort to put the home of living Presidents
F29 1500 on the same basis as Mount Vernon and Monticello recognizes
F29 1510 no party lines. By rough estimate her Committee, headed by Henry
F29 1520 Francis Du Pont, contains three times as many Republicans as Democrats.
F29 1530    The press releases emanating from the White House give
F29 1540 a clue to the activity within. A curator has been appointed. A valuable
F29 1550 pencil-and-sepia allegorical drawing of Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Honore
F29 1560 Fragonard has been donated by the art dealer Georges Wildenstein
F29 1570 and now hangs in the Blue Room. The American Institute
F29 1580 of Interior Designers is redecorating the White House library. Secretary
F29 1590 and Mrs& Dillon have contributed enough pieces of Empire
F29 1600 furniture, including Dolley Madison's own sofa, to furnish a room
F29 1610 in that style. And part of a fabulous collection of <vermeil> hollowware,
F29 1620 bequeathed to the White House by the late Mrs& Margaret
F29 1630 Thompson Biddle, has been taken out of its locked cases and put on display
F29 1640 in the State dining room.   Woman's place is in the home:
F29 1650 man must attend to matters of the yard. One of the vexatious problems
F29 1660 to first confront President Kennedy was the property lying just
F29 1670 across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. Congress had
F29 1680 already appropriated money, and plans were well along to tear down the
F29 1690 buildings flanking Lafayette Square and replace them with what one
F29 1700 critic calls the "marble monumentality" of government office buildings.
F29 1710 While a Senator, Kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to
F29 1720 preserve the Belasco Theater, as well as the Dolley Madison and the
F29 1730 Benjamin Taylor houses, all scheduled for razing.   What to
F29 1740 do about it now that he was President? Only a few days after moving
F29 1750 into the White House. Kennedy made a midnight inspection of the Square.
F29 1760 Then he called in his friend Walton and turned over the problem
F29 1770 to him, with instructions to work out what was best- provided it
F29 1780 didn't pile unnecessary burdens on the President.   The situation
F29 1790 involved some political perils. One of the offices slated for reconstruction
F29 1800 is the aged Court of Claims, diagonally across the street
F29 1810 from the White House. Logically, it should be moved downtown. But
F29 1820 Judge Marvin Jones, senior member of the Court, is an elderly
F29 1830 gentleman who lives at the nearby Metropolitan Club and desires to walk
F29 1840 to work. More importantly, he also happens to be the brother-in-law
F29 1850 of Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House.   There were aesthetic
F29 1860 problems as well as political. On delving deeper, Walton discovered
F29 1870 that most of the buildings fronting the Square could be classified
F29 1880 as "early nondescript". The old Belasco Theater, over which many
F29 1890 people had grown sentimental, was only a shell of its former self
F29 1900 after arduous years as a ~USO Center. The Dolley Madison House,
F29 1910 Walton concluded, was scarcely worth preserving. "The attempt
F29 1920 to save the Square's historic value", he declares, "came half a
F29 1930 century too late".
F30 0010 Surrounded by ancient elms, the campus is spacious and beautiful. The
F30 0020 buildings are mostly Georgian. The Dartmouth student does not live
F30 0030 in monastic seclusion, as he once did. But his is still a simple life
F30 0040 relatively free of the female presence or influence, and he must go
F30 0050 far, even though he may go fast, for sophisticated pleasures. He is
F30 0060 still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence, if he chooses to be.
F30 0070    He is by no means the country boy he might have been in the
F30 0080 last century, down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal
F30 0090 for book learning in his heart. The men's shops on Hanover's
F30 0100 Main Street compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven.
F30 0110 And the automobiles that stream out of Hanover each weekend,
F30 0120 toward Smith and Wellesley and Mount Holyoke, are no less rakish than
F30 0130 those leaving Cambridge or West Philadelphia. But there has
F30 0140 always been an outdoor air to Dartmouth. The would-be sophisticate
F30 0150 and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment. No one
F30 0160 here pokes fun at manly virtues. And this gives rise to an easy camaraderie
F30 0170 probably unequaled elsewhere in the Ivy League. It even affects
F30 0180 the faculty.   Thus, when Dartmouth's Winter Carnival-
F30 0190 widely recognized as the greatest, wildest, roaringest college weekend
F30 0200 anywhere, any time- was broadcast over a national television hookup,
F30 0210 Prexy John Sloan Dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter
F30 0220 garb, topped off by a tam-o'-shanter which he confessed had been
F30 0230 acquired from a Smith girl. President Dickey's golden retriever,
F30 0240 frolicking in the snow at his feet, added to the picture of masculine
F30 0250 informality.   This carefree disdain for "side" cropped up
F30 0260 again in the same television broadcast. Dean Thaddeus Seymour, wearing
F30 0270 ski clothes, was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the Carnival.
F30 0280 She must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown
F30 0290 on her head. So he kissed her. No Dartmouth man was surprised.
F30 0300    Dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal
F30 0310 <sang-froid>. For example, groups regularly canoe down the Connecticut
F30 0330 River. This is in honor of John Ledyard, class of 1773, who scooped
F30 0340 a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in
F30 0350 his own student days. And these hardy travelers are not unappreciated
F30 0360 today. They are hailed by the nation's press, and Smith girls throng
F30 0370 the riverbanks at Northampton and refresh the <voyageurs> with
F30 0380 hot soup and kisses.   Dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic
F30 0390 recreation is skiing. Since the days when their two thousand
F30 0400 pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the United
F30 0410 States, the students have stopped regarding the Olympic Ski Team
F30 0420 as another name for their own. Yet Dartmouth still is the dominant
F30 0430 member of the Intercollegiate Ski Union, which includes the winter
F30 0440 sports colleges of Canada as well as those of this country.   Dartmouth
F30 0450 students ski everywhere in winter, starting with their own front
F30 0460 door. They can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him, or move
F30 0470 out to Oak Hill, where there's a lift. The Dartmouth Skiway,
F30 0480 at Holt's Ledge, ten miles north of the campus, has one of the best
F30 0490 terrains in the East, ranging from novice to expert.   Forty
F30 0500 miles farther north is Mount Moosilauke, Dartmouth's own mountain.
F30 0510 Here, at the Ravine Lodge, President Dickey acts as host every
F30 0520 year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the Dartmouth
F30 0530 Outing Club to life on the trails. The Lodge, built of hand-hewn
F30 0540 virgin spruce, can handle fifty people for dining, sleeping, or
F30 0550 lounging in its huge living room. The Outing Club also owns a chain
F30 0560 of fourteen cabins and several shelters, extending from the Vermont
F30 0570 hills, just across the river from the college, through Hanover to the
F30 0580 College Grant- 27,000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in
F30 0590 the logging country. The cabins are equipped with bunks, blankets,
F30 0600 and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips.
F30 0610 The club runs regular trips to the cabins, but many of the students
F30 0620 prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting,
F30 0630 fishing, climbing, or skiing.   Under the auspices of the Outing
F30 0640 Club, Dartmouth also has the Mountaineering Club, which takes
F30 0650 on tough climbs like Mount McKinley, and Bait + Bullet, whose interests
F30 0660 are self-evident, and even sports a Woodman's Team, which
F30 0670 competes with other New England colleges in wood sawing and
F30 0680 chopping,
F30 0690 canoe races, and the like.   There is much to be said for a college
F30 0700 that, while happily attuned to the sophisticated Ivies, still gives
F30 0710 its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along
F30 0720 back roads where a glimpse of small game, deer, or even bear is not
F30 0730 uncommon. City boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle
F30 0740 or in the sharp tang of a sawmill, come upon suddenly in a backwoods
F30 0750 logging camp. And on the summit of Mount Washington, where thirty-five
F30 0760 degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered
F30 0770 higher than anywhere else in the world, there is a kind of wisdom
F30 0780 to be found that other men often seek in the Himalayas "because
F30 0790 it is there".   There is much to be said for such a college-
F30 0800 and Dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too
F30 0810 loudly. Their affection for their college home has even caused President
F30 0820 Dickey to comment on this "place loyalty" as something rather
F30 0830 specially Hanoverian.   Probably a lawyer once said it best for
F30 0840 all time in the Supreme Court of the United States. Early in the
F30 0850 nineteenth century the State of New Hampshire was casting about
F30 0860 for a way to found its own state university. It fixed on Dartmouth College,
F30 0870 which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered. The
F30 0880 legislators decided to "liberate" Dartmouth and entered into a tug-o'-war
F30 0890 with the college trustees over the control of classrooms, faculty,
F30 0900 and chapel. For a time there were two factions on the campus
F30 0910 fighting for possession of the student body.   The struggle was
F30 0920 resolved in 1819 in the Supreme Court in one of the most intriguing
F30 0930 cases in our judicial history. In 1817 the lawyers were generally debating
F30 0940 the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters. A lawyer,
F30 0950 hired by the college, was arguing specifically for Dartmouth:
F30 0960 Daniel Webster, class of 1801, made her plight the dramatic focus
F30 0970 of his whole plea. In an age of oratory, he was the king of orators,
F30 0980 and both he himself and Chief Justice Marshall were bathed in manly
F30 0990 tears, as Uncle Dan'l reached his thundering climax:   "It
F30 1000 is, sir, as I have said, a small college, and yet there are those
F30 1010 who love it **h".   Dartmouth is today still a small college-
F30 1020 and still a private one, thanks to Webster's eloquence.   This
F30 1030 is not out of keeping with its origins, probably the most humble of
F30 1040 any in the Ivy group. Eleazar Wheelock, a Presbyterian minister,
F30 1050 founded the school in 1769, naming it after the second earl of Dartmouth,
F30 1060 its sponsor and benefactor. Eleazar, pausing on the Hanover plain,
F30 1070 found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands
F30 1080 built the first College Hall, a log hut dedicated "for the education
F30 1090 + instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading,
F30 1100 writing + all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and
F30 1110 expedient for civilizing + christianizing Children of Pagans as well
F30 1120 as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth
F30 1130 and any others".   It was a hardy undertaking, and Wheelock's
F30 1140 was indeed "a voice crying in the wilderness". A road had to
F30 1145 be
F30 1150 hacked through trackless forests between Hanover and Portsmouth to
F30 1160 permit Governor Wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first
F30 1170 Dartmouth commencement in 1771. The governor and his retinue thoughtfully
F30 1180 brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still
F30 1190 one of the cherished possessions of the college.   The exuberance
F30 1200 on this occasion set a standard for subsequent Dartmouth gatherings.
F30 1210 A student orator "produced tears from a great number of the learned"
F30 1220 even before the punch was served. Then from the branches of a
F30 1230 near-by tree an Indian underclassman, disdaining both the platform and
F30 1240 the English language, harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue.
F30 1250 Governor Wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green
F30 1260 beneath the three-hundred-foot pines, and a barrel of rum was broached.
F30 1270 The cook got drunk, and President Wheelock proved to be a man
F30 1280 of broad talents by carving the ox himself.   Future commencements
F30 1290 were more decorous perhaps, but the number of graduates increased
F30 1300 from the original four at a relatively slow pace. By the end of the
F30 1305 nineteenth
F30 1310 century, in 1893, when the Big Three, Columbia, and Penn
F30 1320 were populous centers of learning, Dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine.
F30 1330 The dormitories, including the beloved Dartmouth Hall, could barely
F30 1340 house two hundred students in Spartan fashion.   Then in 1893
F30 1350 Dr& William Jewett Tucker became president and the college's
F30 1360 great awakening began. He transformed Dartmouth from a small New
F30 1370 Hampshire institution into a national college. By 1907 the number of
F30 1380 undergraduates had risen to 1,107. And at his last commencement, in
F30 1390 that year, Dr& Tucker and Dartmouth were honored by the presence
F30 1400 of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the
F30 1410 college. The presidents of Cornell, Wisconsin, C&C&N&Y&,
F30 1420 Bowdoin, Vermont, Brown, Columbia, Princeton, Yale, and Harvard
F30 1430 and the presidents emeritus of Harvard and Michigan were there.
F30 1440    Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today, with approximately
F30 1450 twenty-nine hundred undergraduates. But it has achieved a
F30 1460 cross-section of students from almost all the states, and two-thirds of
F30 1470 its undergraduates come from outside New England. Over 450 different
F30 1480 schools are usually represented in each entering class. Only a dozen
F30 1490 or so schools send as many as six students, and there are seldom more
F30 1500 than fifteen men in any single delegation. About two-thirds of the
F30 1510 boys now come from public schools.   It is still a college only
F30 1520 and not a university; it is, in fact, the only college in the Ivy
F30 1530 group. However, three distinguished associated graduate schools offer
F30 1540 professional curriculums- the Dartmouth Medical School (third oldest
F30 1550 in the country and founded in 1797), the Thayer School of Engineering,
F30 1560 and the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration. All
F30 1570 three are purposely kept small, with a current total enrollment of
F30 1580 about two hundred.   All three schools coordinate their educational
F30 1590 programs with that of the undergraduate college and, like the college
F30 1595 proper,
F30 1600 place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation
F30 1610 for specialized study. Students of the college who are candidates
F30 1620 for the A&B& degree and can satisfy the academic requirements
F30 1630 of the medical and business schools, may enter either of these associated
F30 1640 schools at the beginning of senior year, thus completing the
F30 1650 two-year postgraduate course in one year. The Thayer School offers
F30 1660 a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way, after a boy wins
F30 1670 a B&S& in engineering.   So Dartmouth is moving closer
F30 1680 to the others in the Ivy group. It is still, however, the junior member
F30 1690 of the League, if not in years at least in the catching up it has
F30 1700 had to do. It has not been a well-known school for any part of the span
F30 1710 the other Ivies have enjoyed. However much football has been over-emphasized,
F30 1720 the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by
F30 1730 the scoreboard, so, while Yale need never give its record a thought again
F30 1740 since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888, Dartmouth
F30 1750 had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national
F30 1760 recognition.   It has come on with a rush in more significant areas.
F30 1770 Today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions
F30 1780 might consider somewhat breathtaking. But Dartmouth preserves
F30 1790 its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes, and, although
F30 1800 some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage, they
F30 1810 make for lively copy.   President Emeritus Hopkins once proposed
F30 1820 to corral an "aristocracy of brains" in Hanover.
F31 0010 The person who left the buggy there has never been identified. It was
F31 0020 a busy street, conveniently near the shopping center, and unattended
F31 0030 horses and wagons were often left at the curbside.   There are,
F31 0040 of course, many weaknesses in any case against Emma. She didn't like
F31 0050 her stepmother, but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before
F31 0060 the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage. She had no
F31 0070 way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed.
F31 0080 She would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized
F31 0090 during her travels. If she avoided the train and hired a buggy,
F31 0100 the stableman might have recognized her. If police had checked on
F31 0110 her more thoroughly than is indicated, she would be completely eliminated
F31 0120 as a suspect. ## Uncle John Vinnicum Morse was the immediate
F31 0130 popular suspect. His sudden unannounced appearance at the Borden
F31 0140 home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him,
F31 0150 although he clearly intended to stay overnight, if not longer.
F31 0160    Lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were
F31 0170 in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders, she had been
F31 0180 disturbed by their voices and had closed her door, even though it was
F31 0190 a very hot day.   It is evident that Lizzie did not tell everything
F31 0200 she overheard between her father and her Uncle Morse. At that
F31 0210 time Jennings had a young law associate named Arthur S& Phillips.
F31 0220 A few years ago, not too long before his death, Phillips revealed
F31 0230 in a newspaper story that he had always suspected Morse of the murders.
F31 0240 He said Morse and Borden had quarreled violently in the house that
F31 0250 day, information which must have come from Lizzie. It was obviously
F31 0260 the sound of this argument that caused Lizzie to close her door.
F31 0270    The New Bedford <Standard-Times> has reported Knowlton
F31 0280 as saying, long after the trial, that if he only knew what Borden said
F31 0290 during his conversation with Morse, he would have convicted "somebody".
F31 0300 Notice, Knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a
F31 0310 conviction in the trial of Lizzie Borden. He said he would have convicted
F31 0320 "somebody".   It is known that Morse did associate with
F31 0330 a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at
F31 0340 Westport, a town not far from Fall River. They were a vagabond lot
F31 0350 and considered to be shady and undesirable characters. Fall River police
F31 0360 did go to Westport to see if they could get any information against
F31 0370 Morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from
F31 0380 among these men. These officers found no incriminating information.
F31 0390    Morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed. He said he
F31 0400 returned from the visit to his niece on the 11:20 streetcar. The woman
F31 0410 in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said
F31 0420 she left when he did to shop for her dinner. Fall River is not a
F31 0430 fashionable town. The dinner hour there was twelve noon. If this woman
F31 0440 had delayed until after 11:20 to start her shopping, she would have
F31 0450 had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was
F31 0460 eaten at dinner in those days. It is possible that Morse told the woman
F31 0470 it was 11:20, but it could have been earlier, since she did serve
F31 0480 dinner on time. Police did make an attempt to check on Morse's alibi.
F31 0490 They interviewed the conductor of the streetcar Morse said he
F31 0500 had taken, but the man did not remember Morse as a passenger. Questioned
F31 0510 further, Morse said that there had been four or five priests riding
F31 0520 on the same car with him. The conductor did recall having priests
F31 0530 as passengers and this satisfied police, although the conductor also
F31 0540 pointed out that in heavily Catholic Fall River there were priests
F31 0550 riding on almost every trip the streetcar made, so Morse's statement
F31 0560 really proved nothing.   We do know that Morse left the house
F31 0570 before nine o'clock. Bridget testified she saw him leave through the
F31 0580 side door. Morse said Borden let him out and locked the screen door.
F31 0590 From that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked
F31 0600 leisurely to where his niece was staying, more than a mile away.
F31 0610 He met nobody he knew on this walk. There is no accounting of his movements
F31 0620 in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when Mrs&
F31 0630 Borden was killed.   Morse testified that while he was having
F31 0640 breakfast in the dining room, Mrs& Borden told the servant, "Bridget,
F31 0650 I want you to wash these windows today". Bridget's testimony
F31 0660 was in direct contradiction. She said it was after she returned
F31 0670 from her vomiting spell in the back yard that Mrs& Borden told
F31 0680 her to wash the windows. This was long after Morse had left the house.
F31 0690    Morse's knowledge of what Mrs& Borden told Bridget could
F31 0700 indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden
F31 0710 there. He knew the house fairly well, he had been there on two previous
F31 0720 visits during the past three or four months alone. And despite Knowlton's
F31 0730 attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than
F31 0740 a drum, this was not true. The screen door was unlocked for some ten
F31 0750 or fifteen minutes while Bridget was sick in the back. It was unlocked
F31 0760 all the time she was washing windows. Morse could have returned
F31 0770 openly while Bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room
F31 0780 he had occupied. Mrs& Borden would not have been alarmed if she
F31 0790 saw Morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand. He had been to the farm
F31 0800 the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet
F31 0810 at the farm. Mrs& Borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him
F31 0820 and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she
F31 0830 could cry out. He could have left for Weybosset Street after her
F31 0840 murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar.   If
F31 0850 he took an earlier streetcar than the 11:20 on his return, he could
F31 0860 have arrived at the Borden house shortly after Mr& Borden came
F31 0870 home. With Lizzie in the barn, the screen door unlocked and Bridget
F31 0880 upstairs in her attic room, he would have had free and easy access to
F31 0890 the house. With the second murder over, he could have left, hidden the
F31 0900 weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood.
F31 0910 His unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree,
F31 0920 with crowds already gathering in front of the building and Sawyer guarding
F31 0930 the side door, was odd. There was no close examination of his
F31 0940 clothes for bloodstains, and certainly no scientific test was made of
F31 0950 them. And for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing,
F31 0960 a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed.
F31 0970    The motive may have been the mysterious quarrel; there was
F31 0980 no financial gain for Morse in the murders.   On the other side
F31 0990 of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with
F31 1000 whom she was staying. The time would have been shortly after the
F31 1010 murder of Mrs& Borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior.
F31 1020 He said he had promised Mrs& Borden to return in time for dinner
F31 1030 and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the Borden
F31 1040 house. ## What did Pearson say about Bridget Sullivan as a possible
F31 1050 suspect in his trial-book essay? He wrote:   "The
F31 1060 police soon ceased to look upon either Bridget or Mr& Morse as in
F31 1070 possession of guilty knowledge. Neither had any interest in the deaths;
F31 1080 indeed, it was probably to Mr& Morse's advantage to have
F31 1090 Mr& and Mrs& Borden alive. Both he and Bridget were exonerated
F31 1100 by Lizzie herself". That was his complete discussion of Bridget
F31 1110 Sullivan as a possible suspect.   Although Pearson disbelieved
F31 1120 almost everything Lizzie said, and read a sinister purpose into almost
F31 1130 everything she did, he happily accepted her statement about Bridget
F31 1140 as the whole truth. He felt nothing further need be said about the
F31 1150 servant girl.   The exoneration Pearson speaks of is not an exoneration,
F31 1160 but Lizzie's expression of her opinion, as reported in the
F31 1170 testimony of Assistant Marshal Fleet. This officer had asked Lizzie
F31 1180 if she suspected her Uncle Morse, and she replied she didn't
F31 1190 think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned
F31 1200 after them. Fleet asked the same question about Bridget, and Lizzie
F31 1210 pointed out that as far as she knew Bridget had gone up to her
F31 1220 room
F31 1230 before her father's murder and came down when she called her.
F31 1240    Lizzie, actually, never named any suspect. She told police about
F31 1250 the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some
F31 1260 weeks before the murders, but she said she thought he was from out of
F31 1270 town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner.
F31 1280 And, much as she detested Hiram Harrington, she also did not
F31 1290 accuse him. At the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew
F31 1300 anybody her father had bad feelings toward, or who had bad feelings
F31 1305 toward
F31 1310 her father. She replied, "I know of one man that has not been
F31 1320 friendly with him. They have not been friendly for years". Asked
F31 1330 who this was, she named Harrington. Her statement certainly was true;
F31 1340 the press reported the same facts in using Harrington's interview,
F31 1350 but Lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that Harrington was the
F31 1360 killer.   When I interviewed Kirby, who as a boy picked up pears
F31 1370 in the Borden yard, I asked if anybody else in the household besides
F31 1380 Lizzie and Morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the
F31 1390 murders. He said he had not heard of anybody else. "How about Bridget
F31 1400 Sullivan"? I inquired. "Oh, she was just the maid there",
F31 1410 he replied, waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant
F31 1420 she was. Kirby was, of course, reflecting the opinion that existed
F31 1430 at the time of the murders.   Everyone somehow manages to overlook
F31 1440 completely the fact that, as far as we know, there were exactly two
F31 1450 people in and about the house at the time of both murders: Lizzie
F31 1460 Borden and Bridget Sullivan.   All the officials on the case
F31 1470 seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as Bridget was
F31 1480 concerned, although records in police files contain many reports of
F31 1490 servants who have murdered their employers. True, it is no longer cricket
F31 1500 for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction, but we are dealing
F31 1510 here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters
F31 1520 and situations.   The actions of Bridget should be examined,
F31 1530 since she was there and opportunity did exist, if only to establish her
F31 1540 innocence. There are also other factors that require closer examination.
F31 1550    The legend as it exists in Fall River today always includes
F31 1560 the solemn assurance that Bridget returned to Ireland after the
F31 1570 trial with a "big bundle" of cash which Lizzie gave her for keeping
F31 1580 her mouth shut. The people who believe and retell the legend have
F31 1590 apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know
F31 1600 that the maid changed her testimony on several key points, always to
F31 1610 the detriment of Lizzie. If Bridget did get any bundles of cash,
F31 1620 the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would
F31 1630 have been Lizzie Borden.   Bridget was born in Ireland, one
F31 1640 of fourteen children. She was apparently the pioneer in her family because
F31 1650 she had no close relatives in this country at that time. She worked
F31 1660 as a domestic, first in Newport for a year, and then in South
F31 1670 Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for another year. She finally settled in Fall
F31 1680 River and, after being employed for a time by a Mrs& Reed, was
F31 1690 hired by the Bordens.   I have previously described how, during
F31 1700 the week of the murder, Bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing
F31 1710 and ironing clothes.
F32 0010 Her father, James Upton, was the Upton mentioned by Hawthorne in
F32 0020 the famous introduction to the <Scarlet Letter> as one of those who
F32 0030 came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor
F32 0040 of the port. A gentleman of the old school, Mr& Upton possessed
F32 0050 intellectual power, ample means, and withal, was a devoted Christian.
F32 0060 The daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical
F32 0070 subjects. Her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad
F32 0080 interests.   There is clear evidence that Lucy from childhood
F32 0090 had an unusual mind. She possessed an observant eye, a retentive memory,
F32 0100 and a critical faculty. When she was nine years old, she wrote
F32 0110 a description of a store she had visited. She named 48 items, and said
F32 0120 there were "many more things which it would take too long to write".
F32 0130 An essay on "Freedom" written at 10 years of age quoted the
F32 0140 Declaration of Independence, the freedom given to slaves in Canada,
F32 0150 and the views of George Washington.   Lucy Upton was graduated
F32 0160 from the Salem High School when few colleges, only Oberlin and
F32 0170 Elmira, were open to women; and she had an appetite for learning
F32 0180 that could not be denied.   A picture of her in high school comes
F32 0190 from a younger schoolmate, Albert S& Flint, friend of her brother
F32 0200 Winslow, and later, like Winslow, a noted astronomer. He recalled
F32 0210 Lucy, as "a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly
F32 0220 through the boys' study hall to join the class in Greek in the little
F32 0230 recitation room beyond". The study of Greek was the distinctive
F32 0240 mark of boys destined to go to college, and Lucy Upton too expected
F32 0250 to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men.
F32 0260 The death of her mother in 1865 prevented this. With four younger
F32 0270 children at home, Lucy stepped into her mother's role, and even after
F32 0280 the brothers and sisters were grown, she was her father's comfort
F32 0290 and stay until he died in 1879. But even so Lucy could not give up
F32 0300 her intellectual pursuits. When her brother Winslow became a student
F32 0310 at Brown University in 1874, she wrote him about a course in history
F32 0320 he was taking under Professor Diman: "What is Prof& Diman's
F32 0330 definition of civilization, and take the world through, is its progress
F32 0340 ever onward, or does it retrograde at times? Do you think I
F32 0350 might profitably study some of the history you do, perhaps two weeks
F32 0360 behind you **h". And that she proceeded to do.   Many years later
F32 0370 (on August 3, 1915), Lucy Upton wrote Winslow's daughter soon
F32 0380 to be graduated from Smith College: "While I love botany which,
F32 0390 after dabbling in for years, I studied according to the methods
F32 0400 of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school, it must be fascinating
F32 0410 to take up zoology in the way you are doing. Whatever was the
F32 0420 science in the high school course for the time being, that was my favorite
F32 0430 study. Mathematics came next".   Her study of history
F32 0440 was persistently pursued. She read Maitland's <Dark Ages>, "which
F32 0450 I enjoyed very much"; La Croix on the <Customs of the Middle
F32 0460 Ages>; 16 chapters of Bryce "and liked it more and more";
F32 0470 more chapters of Guizot; Lecky and Stanley's <Eastern Church>.
F32 0480 She discussed in her letters to Winslow some of the questions
F32 0490 that came to her as she studied alone.   Lucy's correspondence
F32 0500 with brother Winslow during his college days was not entirely taken
F32 0510 up with academic studies. She played chess with him by postcard.
F32 0520 Also Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which one could
F32 0530 make the most words from the letters in "importunately". Who won
F32 0540 is not revealed, but Winslow's daughter Eleanor says they got up to
F32 0550 1,212 words.   There was another family interest also. Winslow
F32 0560 had musical talents, as had his father before him. At different times
F32 0570 he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist. And it was
F32 0580 Lucy Upton who first started the idea of a regular course in Music
F32 0590 at Spelman College.   Winslow Upton after graduation from Brown
F32 0600 University and two years of graduate study, accepted a position
F32 0610 at the Harvard Observatory. For three years he was connected with
F32 0620 the U&S& Naval Observatory and with the U&S& Signal Corps;
F32 0630 and after 1883, was professor of astronomy at Brown University.
F32 0640 The six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun, of which he was
F32 0650 a member, took him to Colorado, Virginia, and California as well as
F32 0660 to the South Pacific and to Russia. After her father's death, Lucy
F32 0670 and her youngest sister lived for a few years with Winslow in Washington,
F32 0680 D&C&. "Their house", writes Albert S& Flint,
F32 0690 "was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer, especially grateful
F32 0700 to one like myself far from home". Lucy was a lively part of the
F32 0710 household. Moreover, she had physical as well as mental vigor. Winslow,
F32 0720 as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret recall, used to characterize
F32 0730 her as "our iron sister". There is reason to suppose that Lucy
F32 0740 would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother
F32 0750 had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about
F32 0760 to enter college. As a matter of fact, Albert S& Flint expressed
F32 0770 his conviction that "her physical strength, her mental power, her
F32 0780 lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve
F32 0790 her fellow beings" would have led her "to a distinguished career
F32 0800 amongst the noted women of this country".   While in Washington,
F32 0810 D&C&, Lucy Upton held positions in the U&S& Census
F32 0820 Office, and in the Pension Bureau. They were not sufficiently challenging
F32 0830 however, and she resigned in 1887, to go to Germany with her
F32 0840 brother Winslow and his family while he was there on study. After the
F32 0850 months in Europe, she returned to Boston and became active in church
F32 0860 and community life.   What was called an "accidental meeting"
F32 0870 with Miss Packard in Washington turned her attention to Spelman.
F32 0880 Here was a cause she believed in. After correspondence with Miss
F32 0890 Packard and to the joy of Miss Packard and Miss Giles, she came
F32 0900 to Atlanta, in the fall of 1888, to help wherever needed, although
F32 0910 there was then no money available to pay her a salary. She served for
F32 0920 a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance.
F32 0930    Her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship
F32 0940 and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students;
F32 0950 of her "great power of discernment"; of "her exquisiteness
F32 0960 of dress", "her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts
F32 0970 of the hearers"; her great love of flowers and plants and birds;
F32 0980 and her close knowledge of individual students.   She drew
F32 0990 on all her resources of mind and heart to help them- to make them
F32 1000 at home in the world; and as graduates gratefully recall, she drew on
F32 1010 her purse as well. Many a student was able to remain at Spelman, only
F32 1020 because of her unobtrusive help.   Under Miss Upton, the work
F32 1030 of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption. After all,
F32 1040 she had come to Spelman Seminary in 1888, and had been since 1891 except
F32 1050 for one year, Associate Principal or Dean. She had taught classes
F32 1060 in botany, astronomy (with the aid of a telescope), geometry,
F32 1070 and
F32 1080 psychology.   Miss Upton and Miss Packard, as a matter of fact,
F32 1090 had many tastes in common. Both had eager and inquiring minds; and
F32 1100 both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the
F32 1110 development of sturdy character and Christian zeal. Both loved the
F32 1120 out-of-doors, including mountain climbing and horseback riding. In 1890
F32 1130 when the trip to Europe and the Holy Land was arranged for Miss
F32 1140 Packard, it was Miss Upton who planned the trip, and "with rare
F32 1150 executive ability" bore the brunt of "the entire pilgrimage from
F32 1160 beginning to end". So strenuous it was physically, with its days of
F32 1170 horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance
F32 1180 for both Miss Packard and Miss Upton. Yet they thrived on
F32 1190 it.   At the Fifteenth
F32 1200 Anniversary (1896) as already quoted, Miss
F32 1210 Upton projected with force and eloquence the Spelman of the Future
F32 1220 as a college of first rank, with expanding and unlimited horizons.
F32 1230 When Dr& Wallace Buttrick, wise in his judgment of people, declined
F32 1240 to have the Science Building named for him, he wrote Miss Tapley
F32 1250 (April 7, 1923) "**h If you had asked me, I think I would have
F32 1260 suggested that you name the building for Miss Upton. Her services
F32 1270 to the School for many years were of a very high character, and I
F32 1280 have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her".
F32 1290    Such were the qualities of the Acting-President of the Seminary
F32 1310 after the death of Miss Giles.   At the meeting of the
F32 1320 Board of Trustees, on March 3, 1910, Miss Upton presented the annual
F32 1330 report of the President. She noted that no student had been withdrawn
F32 1340 through loss of confidence; that the enrollment showed an increase
F32 1350 of boarding students as was desired; and that the year's work
F32 1360 had gone forward smoothly. She urged the importance of more thorough
F32 1370 preparation for admission. The raising of the $25,000 Improvement
F32 1380 Fund two days before the time limit expired, and the spontaneous "praise
F32 1390 demonstration" held afterward on the campus, were reported as
F32 1400 events which had brought happiness to Miss Giles. With the Fund in
F32 1410 hand, the debt on the boilers had been paid; Rockefeller and Packard
F32 1420 Halls had been renovated; walks laid; and ground had been broken
F32 1430 for the superintendent's home. Miss Upton spoke gratefully of
F32 1440 the response of Spelman graduates and Negro friends in helping to raise
F32 1450 the Fund, and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly
F32 1460 needed current expenses. She spoke also with deep thankfulness of the
F32 1470 many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the
F32 1480 years had made the work so fruitful in results.   Two bequests
F32 1490 were recorded: one of $200 under the will of Mrs& Harriet A&
F32 1500 Copp of Los Angeles; and one of $2,000 under the will of Miss Celia
F32 1510 L& Brett of Hamilton, New York, a friend from the early days.
F32 1520    Miss Upton told the Trustees that the death of Miss Giles
F32 1530 was "the sorest grief" the Seminary had ever been called upon
F32 1550 to bear. The daughters of Spelman, she said, had never known or thought
F32 1560 of Spelman without her. The removal of Miss Packard 18 years earlier
F32 1570 had caused them great sorrow, but they still had Miss Giles.
F32 1580 Now the school was indeed bereft. "Yet Spelman has strong, deep roots,
F32 1590 and will live for the blessing of generations to come". #@#
F32 1600 Miss Mary Jane Packard, Sophia's half-sister, became ill in
F32 1610 March, 1910; and when school closed, she was unable to travel to Massachusetts.
F32 1620 She remained in Atlanta through June and July; she
F32 1630 died on August sixth.   Before coming on a visit to Spelman
F32 1640 in 1885, Miss Mary had been a successful teacher in Worcester, and
F32 1650 her position there was held open for her for a considerable period. But
F32 1660 she decided to stay at Spelman. She helped with teaching as well
F32 1670 as office work for a few years- the catalogues show that she had classes
F32 1680 in geography, rhetoric and bookkeeping. Soon the office work claimed
F32 1690 all her time. She was closely associated with the Founders in all
F32 1700 their trials and hardships. Quiet and energetic, cheerful and calm,
F32 1710 she too was a power in the development of the seminary. Miss Giles
F32 1720 always used to refer to her as "Sister". She served as secretary
F32 1730 in the Seminary office for 25 years, and was in charge of correspondence,
F32 1740 records, and bookkeeping. The books of the school hold a memorial
F32 1750 to her; and so do the hearts of students and of teachers.
F32 1760    Mary J& Packard, states a <Messenger> editorial, was "efficient,
F32 1770 pains-taking, self-effacing, loving, radiating the spirit of her
F32 1780 Master. With infinite patience she responded to every call, no matter
F32 1790 at what cost to herself, and to her all went, for she was sure to
F32 1800 have the needed information or word of cheer.
F33 0010    In a few school districts one finds a link between school and
F33 0020 job. In those vocational programs organized with Smith-Hughes money,
F33 0030 there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer
F33 0040 on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other. In these cases
F33 0050 a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program, saving
F33 0060 a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12. The apprentice
F33 0070 program will involve further education on a part-time basis, usually
F33 0080 at night, perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high
F33 0090 school. These opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such
F33 0100 crafts as auto mechanics, carpentry, drafting, electrical work, tool-and-die
F33 0110 work, and sheet-metal work.   Formally organized vocational
F33 0120 programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to
F33 0130 gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time
F33 0140 job on graduation. The "diversified occupations" program is a
F33 0150 part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on
F33 0160 a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business
F33 0170 employers. The "distributive education" program operates in
F33 0180 a similar way, with arrangements between the school and employers in
F33 0185 merchandising
F33 0190 fields. In both cases the student attends school half-time
F33 0200 and works in a regular job the other half. He receives remuneration
F33 0210 for his work. In a few places cooperative programs between schools
F33 0220 and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing
F33 0230 the student, while still in school, to develop skills which are
F33 0240 immediately marketable upon graduation.   Adult education courses,
F33 0250 work-study programs of various sorts- these are all evidence of
F33 0260 a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities
F33 0270 for out-of-school youth. In general, however, it may be said
F33 0280 that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school, the school authorities
F33 0290 play little or no part in the decision of what happens next. If the
F33 0300 student drops out of high school, the break with the school is even
F33 0310 more complete. When there is employment opportunity for youth, this
F33 0320 arrangement- or lack of arrangement- works out quite well. Indeed,
F33 0330 in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities
F33 0340 have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were
F33 0350 potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and
F33 0360 went to work. Statistically this has represented a loss to the nation,
F33 0370 although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in
F33 0380 retrospect may have been a wise one. I make no attempt to measure the
F33 0390 enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work
F33 0400 on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business
F33 0410 which he entered. He may or may not be "better off" than his
F33 0420 classmate who went on to a college and professional school. But in
F33 0430 the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all
F33 0440 the potential professional talent.   In a later chapter dealing
F33 0450 with the suburban school, I shall discuss the importance of arranging
F33 0460 a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any
F33 0470 high school where he is found. In the Negro neighborhoods and also
F33 0480 to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of
F33 0490 identification and motivation. High motivation towards higher education
F33 0500 must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches
F33 0510 grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are
F33 0520 essential for academic work. Undoubtedly far more can be done in the
F33 0530 lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools. However, the teacher
F33 0540 can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family
F33 0550 is anti-intellectual. And the fact remains that there are today few
F33 0560 shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership.
F33 0570 This is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the Northern
F33 0580 universities. Quite the contrary, as I can testify from personal
F33 0590 experience as a former university president. Rather we see here
F33 0600 another vicious circle. The absence of successful Negroes in the world
F33 0610 of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among
F33 0620 Negro youth for academic careers. I believe the situation is improving,
F33 0630 but the success stories need to be heavily publicized. Here again
F33 0640 we run into the roadblock that Negroes do not like to be designated
F33 0650 as Negroes in the press. How can the vicious circle be broken? This
F33 0660 is a problem to which leaders of opinion, both Negro and white,
F33 0670 should devote far more attention. It is at least as important as the
F33 0680 more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the South.
F33 0690 #VOCATIONAL EDUCATION# I should like to underline four points
F33 0700 I made in my first report with respect to vocational education. First
F33 0710 and foremost, vocational courses should not replace courses which
F33 0720 are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation. Second,
F33 0730 vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and
F33 0740 not require more than half the student's time in those years; however,
F33 0750 for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to
F33 0760 begin earlier. Third, the significance of the vocational courses is
F33 0770 that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work; they realize
F33 0780 the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers, and this
F33 0790 sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they
F33 0800 are studying at the same time. Fourth, the type of vocational training
F33 0810 programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the
F33 0820 general locality. This last point is important because if high school
F33 0830 pupils are aware that few, if any, graduates who have chosen a certain
F33 0840 vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training,
F33 0850 the whole idea of relevance disappears. Vocational training which
F33 0860 holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable
F33 0870 skill becomes just another school "chore" for those whose interest
F33 0880 in their studies has begun to falter. Those who, because of population
F33 0890 mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees,
F33 0900 would limit vocational education to general rather than specific
F33 0910 skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind
F33 0920 of school experience.   I have been using the word "vocational"
F33 0930 as a layman would at first sight think it should be used. I intend
F33 0940 to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys
F33 0950 and girls. These courses develop skills other than those we think of
F33 0960 when we use the adjective "academic". Practically all of these practical
F33 0970 skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained
F33 0980 in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at
F33 0990 once on the basis of the skill. They are in this sense skills marketable
F33 1000 immediately on graduation from high school. To be sure, in tool-and-die
F33 1010 work and in the building trades, the first job must be often
F33 1020 on an apprentice basis, but two years of half-time vocational training
F33 1030 enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status.
F33 1040 Similarly, a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography
F33 1050 and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job
F33 1060 at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two
F33 1070 of further study in a community college or secretarial school. Of course,
F33 1080 it can be argued that an ability to write English correctly and
F33 1090 with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill. So, too, is the
F33 1095 mathematical
F33 1100 competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics.
F33 1110 In a sense almost all high school and college courses could be
F33 1120 considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student
F33 1130 in his vocation (which may be a profession) will be called upon to use
F33 1140 some of the skills developed and the competence obtained. In spite
F33 1150 of the shading of one type of course into another, I believe it is useful
F33 1160 to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses.
F33 1170 Perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which
F33 1180 proves the rule. Today many college bound students try to take a
F33 1190 course in personal typing, as they feel a certain degree of mastery of
F33 1200 this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work
F33 1210 in college and a professional school.   Most of our largest
F33 1220 cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools.
F33 1230 In this respect, public education in the large cities differs from education
F33 1240 in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts. The
F33 1250 neighborhood high schools are not, strictly speaking, comprehensive schools,
F33 1260 because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational
F33 1270 or technical high school instead of the local school. Indeed, one
F33 1280 school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term
F33 1285 comprehensive
F33 1290 high school for the senior high schools in his city, because
F33 1300 these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs. He prefers
F33 1310 to designate such schools as "general" high schools. The suburban
F33 1320 high school, it is worth noting, also is not a widely comprehensive
F33 1330 high school because of the absence of vocational programs. The reason
F33 1350 is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community. Therefore
F33 1360 employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan
F33 1370 area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic
F33 1380 of the comprehensive high school described in my first report.
F33 1390    The separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities
F33 1400 must be reckoned as permanent institutions. By and large their programs
F33 1410 are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and
F33 1420 to the realities of the apprentice system. It is not often realized
F33 1430 to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of
F33 1440 employment, except for a lucky few. One has to talk confidentially with
F33 1450 some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a
F33 1460 boy cannot just say, "I want to be a plumber", and then, by doing
F33 1470 good work, find a job. It is far more difficult in many communities
F33 1480 to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval
F33 1490 than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation.
F33 1500 Two stories will illustrate what I have in mind. One vocational instructor
F33 1510 in a city vocational school, speaking of his course in a certain
F33 1520 field, said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs <outside>
F33 1530 of the city. In the city, he said, the waiting list for those
F33 1540 who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside
F33 1550 track he can't get in. In a far distant part of the United States,
F33 1560 I was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade
F33 1570 was doing special work. "What does he have in mind to do when he
F33 1580 graduates"? "Oh, he'll be a plumber", came the answer. "But
F33 1590 isn't it almost impossible to get into the union"? I asked.
F33 1600 "He'll have no difficulty", I was told. "He has very good
F33 1610 connections".   In my view, there should be a school which offers
F33 1620 significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every
F33 1630 family in a city. Ideally these schools should be so located that
F33 1640 one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is
F33 1650 at the highest.   An excellent example of a successful location
F33 1660 of a new vocational high school is the Dunbar Vocational High School
F33 1670 in Chicago. Located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment,
F33 1680 this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational
F33 1690 aims of its students. Hardly a window has been broken since
F33 1700 Dunbar
F33 1710 first was opened (and vandalism in schools is a major problem in many
F33 1720 slum areas). I discovered in the course of a visit there that almost
F33 1730 all the pupils were Negroes. They were learning trades as diverse
F33 1740 as shoe repairing, bricklaying, carpentry, cabinet making, auto mechanics,
F33 1750 and airplane mechanics. The physical facilities at Dunbar are
F33 1760 impressive, but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils.
F34 0010    The soybean seed is the most important leguminous food in the
F34 0020 world. In the United States, where half of the world crop is grown,
F34 0030 soybeans are processed for their edible oil. The residue from soybean
F34 0040 processing goes mainly into animal feeds.   Soybeans are extensively
F34 0050 processed into a remarkable number of food products in the Orient.
F34 0060 American chemists, seeking to increase exports of soybeans, have
F34 0070 adapted modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve their
F34 0080 use in such traditional Japanese foods as tofu and miso and in tempeh
F34 0090 of Indonesia. Soybean flour, grits, flakes, "milk", and curd can
F34 0100 be bought in the United States.   Peanuts are the world's
F34 0110 second most important legume. They are used mainly for their oil. We
F34 0120 produce peanut oil, but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed.
F34 0130 Blanched peanuts, as prepared for making peanut butter or for eating
F34 0140 as nuts, are roasted seeds whose seedcoats have been rubbed off.
F34 0150    Cereal grains, supplemented with soybeans or dry edible peas or beans,
F34 0160 comprise about two-thirds or three-fourths of the diet in parts of
F34 0170 Asia and Africa.   In western Europe and North America, where
F34 0180 the level of economic development is higher, grains and other seed
F34 0190 products furnish less than one-third of the food consumed. Rather,
F34 0200 meat and potatoes, sugar, and dairy products are the main sources of
F34 0205 carbohydrate,
F34 0210 protein, oils, and fats. People depend less on seeds for
F34 0220 foods in Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina, where extensive grazing
F34 0230 lands support sheep or cattle, and the consumption of meat is high.
F34 0240    Feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the world's
F34 0250 cereal crop in 1957-1958. Most of the grain is fed to swine and dairy
F34 0260 cows and lesser amounts to beef cattle and poultry. About 90 percent
F34 0270 of the corn used in the United States is fed to animals. The rest
F34 0280 is used for human food and industrial products. More than half of the
F34 0290 sorghum and barley seeds we produce and most of the byproducts of the
F34 0300 milling of cereals and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock.
F34 0310    More than 200 million tons of seeds and seed products are fed
F34 0320 to livestock annually in the United States.   The efficiency
F34 0330 with which animals convert grains and forages to meat has risen steadily
F34 0340 in the United States since the 1930's and has paralleled the increased
F34 0350 feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when seeds
F34 0360 are processed for oil. ## THE DEMAND for food is so great in
F34 0370 the world that little arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood
F34 0380 crops. Seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively minor
F34 0390 position.   Chief among the seed crops grown primarily for industrial
F34 0400 uses are the oil-bearing seeds- flax, castor, tung (nuts from
F34 0410 the China wood-oil tree), perilla (from an Oriental mint), and oiticica
F34 0420 (from a Brazilian tree).   Oils, or liquid fats, from the
F34 0430 seeds of flax and tung have long been the principal constituents of paints
F34 0440 and varnishes for protecting and beautifying the surfaces of wood
F34 0450 and metal. These oils develop hard, smooth films when they dry and form
F34 0460 resinlike substances.   The artist who paints in oil uses drying
F34 0470 oils to carry the pigments and to protect his finished work for the
F34 0480 ages. One of the finest of artists' oils comes from poppy seeds.
F34 0490    Seeds of soybean, cotton, corn, sesame, and rape yield semidrying
F34 0500 oils. Some are used in paints along with drying oils. Palm oil
F34 0510 protects the surfaces of steel sheets before they are plated with tin.
F34 0520    Castor oil, made from castorbeans, has gone out of style as a
F34 0530 medicine. This nondrying oil, however, is now more in demand than ever
F34 0540 before as a fine lubricant, as a constituent of fluids for hydraulically
F34 0550 operated equipment, and as a source of chemicals to make plastics.
F34 0560    Almond oil, another nondrying oil, was once used extensively
F34 0570 in perfumery to extract flower fragrances. It is still used in drugs
F34 0580 and cosmetics, but it is rather scarce and sometimes is adulterated with
F34 0590 oils from peach and plum seeds.   Liquid fats from all these
F34 0600 oilseeds enter into the manufacture of soaps for industry and the household
F34 0610 and of glycerin for such industrial uses as making explosives.
F34 0620    Sizable amounts of soybean, coconut, and palm kernel oil- seed
F34 0630 oils that are produced primarily for food purposes- also are used
F34 0640 to make soaps, detergents, and paint resins.   Solid fats from
F34 0650 the seeds of the mahua tree, the shea tree, and the coconut palm are used
F34 0660 to make candles in tropical countries.   Seeds are a main source
F34 0670 of starch for industrial and food use in many parts of the world.
F34 0680 Corn and wheat supply most of the starch in the United States, Canada,
F34 0690 and Australia. In other countries where cereal grains are not
F34 0700 among the principal crops of a region, starchy tubers or roots are processed
F34 0710 for starch. Starch is used in the paper, textile, and food-processing
F34 0720 industries and in a multitude of other manufacturing operations.
F34 0730    Gums were extracted from quince, psyllium (fleawort), flax,
F34 0740 and locust (carob) seeds in ancient times. Today the yearly import
F34 0750 into the United States of locust bean gum is more than 15 million pounds;
F34 0760 of psyllium seed, more than 2.6 million. The discovery during
F34 0770 the Second World War that guar gum was similar to imported locust
F34 0780 gum increased its cultivation in western Asia and initiated it in the
F34 0790 United States.   Water-soluble gums are used in foods and drugs
F34 0800 and in the manufacture of pulp and paper as thickeners, stabilizers,
F34 0810 or dispersing agents. Guar gum thickens salad dressings and stabilizes
F34 0820 ice cream. Quince seed gum is the main ingredient in wave-setting
F34 0830 lotions. Once regarded as an agricultural nuisance, psyllium was sold
F34 0840 in the 1930's as a mechanical laxative under 117 different brands.
F34 0850 Locust gum is added to pulp slurries to break up the lumps of fibers
F34 0860 in making paper. ## THE SEEDS of hard, fibrous, stony fruits,
F34 0870 called nuts, provide highly concentrated foods, oils, and other materials
F34 0880 of value. Most nuts consist of the richly packaged storage kernel
F34 0890 and its thick, adherent, brown covering- the seedcoat.   The
F34 0900 kernels of brazil nuts, cashews, coconuts, filberts, hazelnuts, hickory
F34 0910 nuts, pecans, walnuts, and pine nuts are predominantly oily. Almonds
F34 0920 and pistachio nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein.
F34 0930 Chestnuts are starchy. All nut kernels are rich in protein.
F34 0940 The world production of familiar seed nuts- almonds, brazil nuts,
F34 0950 filberts, and the English walnuts- totals about 300 thousand tons annually.
F34 0960    Coconuts, the fruit of the coconut palm, have the largest
F34 0970 of all known seeds and are grown in South Pacific islands as a
F34 0980 crop for domestic and export markets. The oil palm of West Africa yields
F34 0990 edible oil from both the flesh and the seed or kernel of its fruit.
F34 1000 World production of copra, the oil-bearing flesh of the coconut,
F34 1010 was a little more than 3 million tons in 1959. Exports from producing
F34 1020 countries in terms of equivalent oil were a little more than 1 million
F34 1030 tons, about half of which was palm kernels or oil from them and about
F34 1040 half was palm oil.   Other nuts consumed in lesser quantity include
F34 1050 the spicy nutmeg; the soap nut, which owes its sudsing power
F34 1060 to natural saponins; the marking nut, used for ink and varnish; the
F34 1070 aromatic sassafras nut of South America; and the sweet-smelling
F34 1080 cumara nut, which is suited for perfumes.   A forest crop that has
F34 1090 not been extensively cultivated is ivory nuts from the tagua palm.
F34 1100 The so-called vegetable ivory is the hard endosperm of the egg-sized
F34 1110 seed. It is used for making buttons and other small, hard objects of
F34 1120 turnery. Seeds of the sago palm are used in Bermuda to make heads and
F34 1130 faces of dolls sold to tourists. ## THE COLOR AND SHAPE of
F34 1140 seeds have long made them attractive for ornaments and decorations.
F34 1150    Since Biblical times, rosaries have been made from jobs-tears-
F34 1160 the seeds of an Asiatic grass. Bead tree seeds are the necklaces
F34 1170 of South Pacific islanders and the eyes of Buddha dolls in Cuba.
F34 1180 Victorian ladies had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry.
F34 1190    Handmade Christmas wreaths and trees often contain a variety
F34 1200 of seeds collected during the year.   Tradition has assigned
F34 1210 medicinal values to seeds because of their alkaloids, aromatic oils,
F34 1220 and highly flavored components. Although science has given us more effective
F34 1230 materials, preparations from anise, castorbean, colchicum, nux
F34 1240 vomica, mustard, fennel, and stramonium are familiar to many for the
F34 1250 relief of human ailments. Flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters still
F34 1260 are used by some persons.   Peanut and sesame oils often are
F34 1270 used as carriers or diluents for medicines administered by injection.
F34 1280    Still another
F34 1290 group of seeds (sometimes tiny, dry, seed-bearing
F34 1300 fruits) provide distinctive flavors and odors to foods, although the
F34 1310 nutrients they supply are quite negligible. The common spices, flavorings,
F34 1320 and condiments make up this group.   Each year millions of
F34 1330 pounds of anise, caraway, mustard, celery, and coriander and the oils
F34 1340 extracted from them are imported.   Single-seeded dry fruits used
F34 1350 for flavoring include several of the carrot family, such as cumin,
F34 1360 dill, fennel, and angelica. Less common seeds used in cooking and beverages
F34 1370 include fenugreek (artificial maple flavor) and cardamom. White
F34 1380 pepper is the ground seed of the common black pepper fruit.   Sesame
F34 1390 seed, which comes from the tall pods of a plant grown in Egypt,
F34 1400 Brazil, and Central America, has a toasted-nut flavor and can be
F34 1410 used in almost any dish calling for almonds. It is a main flavoring for
F34 1420 halvah, the candy of the Middle East. Sesame sticks, a snack dip,
F34 1430 originated in the Southwest.   Beverages are made from seeds
F34 1440 the world over.   Coffee is made from the roasted and ground seeds
F34 1450 of the coffee tree. World production of coffee broke all previous
F34 1460 records in 1959 and 1960 at more than 5 million tons. Per capita consumption
F34 1470 remains around 16 pounds in the United States.   Cocoa,
F34 1480 chocolate, and cocoa butter come from the ground seeds of the cacao
F34 1490 tree. World production of about 1 million tons is divided primarily between
F34 1500 Africa (63 percent) and South America (27 percent).   Several
F34 1510 soft drinks contain extracts from kola nuts, the seed of the kola
F34 1520 tree cultivated in the West Indies and South America.   Cereal
F34 1530 grains have been used for centuries to prepare fermented beverages.
F34 1540 The Japanese sake is wine fermented from rice grain. Arrack is
F34 1550 distilled from fermented rice in India.   Beer, generally fermented
F34 1560 from barley, is an old alcoholic beverage. Beer was brewed by the
F34 1570 Babylonians and Egyptians more than 6 thousand years ago. Brewers
F34 1580 today use corn, rice, and malted barley.   Distillers use corn,
F34 1590 malt, wheat, grain sorghum, and rye in making beverage alcohol. ##
F34 1600 SEED CROPS hold a prominent place in the agricultural economy
F34 1610 of the United States.   The farm value of seeds produced in this
F34 1620 country for all purposes, including the cereals, is nearly 10 billion
F34 1630 dollars a year. Cereal grains, oilseeds, and dry beans and peas account
F34 1640 for about 57 percent of the farm value of all crops raised.
F34 1650    The economic importance of seed crops actually is even greater, because
F34 1660 additional returns are obtained from most of the corn, oats, barley,
F34 1670 and sorghum- as well as the cake and meal from the processing
F34 1680 of flaxseed, cottonseed, and soybeans- through conversion to poultry,
F34 1690 meat, and dairy products.   Seeds furnish about 40 percent of
F34 1700 the total nutrients consumed by all livestock. Hay and pasture are the
F34 1710 other chief sources of livestock feed.   Seeds are the essential
F34 1720 raw materials for milling grain, baking, crushing oilseed, refining
F34 1730 edible oil, brewing, distilling, and mixing feed.   More than 11
F34 1740 thousand business establishments in the United States were based on
F34 1750 cereals and oilseeds in 1954. The value of products from these industries
F34 1760 was 15.8 billion dollars, of which about one-third was created
F34 1770 by manufacturing processes. Not included was the value of seed oil in
F34 1780 paints and varnishes or the value of the coffee and chocolate industries
F34 1790 that are based on imported seed or seed products.   Cereal grains
F34 1800 furnish about one-fourth of the total food calories in the American
F34 1810 diet and about one-third of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock
F34 1820 and poultry.
F35 0010    To hold a herd of cattle on a new range till they felt at home
F35 0020 was called "locatin'" 'em. To keep 'em scattered somewhat
F35 0030 and yet herd 'em was called "loose herdin'". To hold 'em in
F35 0040 a compact mass was "close herdin'". Cattle were inclined to remain
F35 0050 in a territory with which they were acquainted. That became their
F35 0060 "home range". Yet there were always some that moved farther and
F35 0070 farther out, seekin' grass and water. These became "strays",
F35 0080 the term bein' restricted to cattle, however, as hosses, under like
F35 0090 circumstances, were spoken of as "stray hosses", not merely "strays".
F35 0100    Cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till it
F35 0110 was over. You couldn't stop 'em; you had to go with 'em or wait
F35 0120 till the storm was over, and follow. Such marchin' in wholesale
F35 0130 numbers was called a "drift", or "winter drift", and if the storm
F35 0140 was prolonged it usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the
F35 0150 range. The cowboy made a technical distinction in reference to the number
F35 0160 of them animals. The single animal or a small bunch were referred
F35 0170 to as "strays"; but when a large number were "bunched up"
F35 0180 or "banded up", and marched away from their home range, as long as
F35 0190 they stayed together the group was said to be a "drift". Drifts
F35 0200 usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape the severe cold winds,
F35 0210 but it could also occur in summer as the result of lack of water or
F35 0220 grass because of a drought, or as an aftermath of a stampede. Drifts
F35 0230 usually happened only with cattle, for hosses had 'nough sense to avoid
F35 0240 'em, and to find shelter for 'emselves.   The wholesale
F35 0250 death of cattle as a result of blizzards, and sometimes droughts, over
F35 0260 a wide range of territory was called a "die-up". Followin' such
F35 0270 an event there was usually a harvest of "fallen hides", and the
F35 0280 ranchers needed skinnin' knives instead of brandin' irons. Cattle
F35 0290 were said to be "potted" when "blizzard choked", that is, caught
F35 0300 in a corner or a draw, or against a "drift fence" durin' a
F35 0310 storm. Cattle which died from them winter storms were referred to as
F35 0320 the "winter kill". When cattle in winter stopped and humped their
F35 0330 backs up they were said to "bow up". This term was also used by
F35 0340 the cowboy in the sense of a human showin' fight, as one cowhand was
F35 0350 heard to say, "He arches his back like a mule in a hailstorm". Cattle
F35 0360 drove to the northern ranges and held for two winters to mature
F35 0370 'em into prime beef were said to be "double wintered".   Cattle
F35 0380 brought into a range from a distance were called "immigrants".
F35 0390 Them new to the country were referred to as "pilgrims". This
F35 0400 word was first applied to the imported hot-blooded cattle, but later
F35 0410 was more commonly used as reference to a human tenderfoot. Hereford cattle
F35 0420 were often called "white faces", or "open-face cattle",
F35 0430 and the old-time cowman gave the name of "hothouse stock" to them
F35 0440 newly introduced cattle. Because Holstein cattle weren't a beef breed,
F35 0450 they were rarely seen on a ranch, though one might be found now and
F35 0460 then for the milk supply. The cowboy called this breed of cattle "magpies".
F35 0470 A "cattaloe" was a hybrid offspring of buffalo and
F35 0480 cattle.
F35 0490 "Dry stock" denoted, regardless of age or sex, such bovines
F35 0500 as were givin' no milk. A "wet herd" was a herd of cattle made
F35 0510 up entirely of cows, while "wet stuff" referred to cows givin'
F35 0520 milk. The cowboy's humorous name for a cow givin' milk was a "milk
F35 0530 pitcher". Cows givin' no milk were knowed as "strippers".
F35 0540 The terminology of the range, in speakin' of "dry stock" and
F35 0550 "wet stock", was confusin' to the tenderfoot. The most common reference
F35 0560 to "wet stock" was with the meanin' that such animals had
F35 0570 been smuggled across the Rio Grande after bein' stolen from their
F35 0580 rightful owners. The term soon became used and applied to all stolen
F35 0590 animals. "Mixed herd" meant a herd of mixed sexes, while a "straight
F35 0600 steer herd" was one composed entirely of steers, and when the
F35 0610 cowman spoke of "mixed cattle", he meant cattle of various grades,
F35 0620 ages, and sexes.   In the spring when penned cattle were turned
F35 0630 out to grass, this was spoken of as "turn-out time", or "put
F35 0640 to grass". "Shootin' 'em out" was gettin' cattle out of
F35 0650 a corral onto the range. When a cow came out of a corral in a crouchin'
F35 0660 run she was said to "come out a-stoopin'". To stir cattle
F35 0670 up and get 'em heated and excited was to "mustard the cattle", and
F35 0680 the act was called "ginnin' 'em 'round", or "chousin'
F35 0690 'em". After a roundup the pushin' of stray cattle of outside brands
F35 0700 toward their home range was called "throwin' over".
F35 0720 A cow rose from the ground rear end first. By the time her hindquarters
F35 0730 were in a standin' position, her knees were on the ground in a prayin'
F35 0740 attitude. It was when she was in this position that the name
F35 0750 "prayin' cow" was suggested to the cowboy. They were said to be
F35 0760 "on their heads" when grazin'. "On the hoof" was a reference
F35 0770 to live cattle and was also used in referrin' to cattle travelin'
F35 0780 by trail under their own power as against goin' by rail. Shippin'
F35 0790 cattle by train was called a "stock run". A general classification
F35 0800 given grass-fed cattle was "grassers".   When a cowboy
F35 0810 spoke of "dustin'" a cow, he meant that he throwed dust into her
F35 0820 eyes. The cow, unlike a bull or steer, kept her eyes open and her
F35 0830 mind on her business when chargin', and a cow "on the prod" or "on
F35 0840 the peck" was feared by the cowhand more than any of his other
F35 0850 charges.   The Injun's name for beef was "wohaw", and many
F35 0860 of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association with the Injun
F35 0870 on the trails. The first cattle the Injuns saw under the white
F35 0880 man's control were the ox teams of the early freighters. Listenin'
F35 0890 with wonder at the strange words of the bullwhackers as they shouted
F35 0900 "Whoa", "Haw", and "Gee", they thought them words the
F35 0910 names of the animals, and began callin' cattle "wohaws". Rarely
F35 0920 did a trail herd pass through the Injun country on its march north
F35 0930 that it wasn't stopped to receive demand for "wohaw".   "Tailin'"
F35 0940 was the throwin' of an animal by the tail in lieu of a
F35 0950 rope. Any animal could when travelin' fast, be sent heels over head
F35 0960 by the simple process of overtakin' the brute, seizin' its tail,
F35 0970 and givin' the latter a pull to one side. This throwed the animal
F35 0980 off balance, and over it'd crash onto its head and shoulders. Though
F35 0990 the slightest yank was frequently capable of producin' results, many
F35 1000 men assured success through a turn of the tail 'bout the saddle
F35 1010 horn, supplemented sometimes, in the case of cattle, by a downward heave
F35 1020 of the rider's leg upon the strainin' tail. Such tactics were
F35 1030 resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns, and a thorough
F35 1040 "tailin'" usually knocked the breath out of a steer, and so dazed
F35 1050 'im that he'd behave for the rest of the day. It required both
F35 1060 a quick and swift hoss and a darin' rider. When cattle became more
F35 1070 valuable, ranch owners frowned upon this practice and it was discontinued,
F35 1080 at least when the boss was 'round. When the cowboy used the word
F35 1090 "tailin's", he meant stragglers.   "Bull tailin'"
F35 1100 was a game once pop'lar with the Mexican cowboys of Texas. From
F35 1110 a pen of wild bulls one would be released, and with much yellin' a
F35 1120 cowhand'd take after 'im. Seizin' the bull by the tail, he rushed
F35 1130 his hoss forward and a little to one side, throwin' the bull off
F35 1140 balance, and "bustin'" 'im with terrific force. Rammin' one
F35 1150 horn of a downed steer into the ground to hold 'im down was called
F35 1160 "peggin'".   Colors of cattle came in for their special names.
F35 1170 An animal covered with splotches or spots of different colors was
F35 1180 called a "brindle" or "brockle". A "lineback" was an animal
F35 1190 with a stripe of different color from the rest of its body runnin'
F35 1200 down its back, while a "lobo stripe" was the white, yeller, or
F35 1210 brown stripe runnin' down the back, from neck to tail, a characteristic
F35 1220 of many Spanish cattle. A "mealynose" was a cow or steer of
F35 1230 the longhorn type, with lines and dots of a color lighter'n the rest
F35 1240 of its body 'round the eyes, face, and nose. Such an animal was
F35 1250 said to be "mealynosed". "Sabinas" was a Spanish word used to
F35 1260 describe cattle of red and white peppered and splotched colorin'.
F35 1270 The northern cowboy called all the red Mexican cattle which went up
F35 1280 the trail "Sonora reds", while they called all cattle drove up from
F35 1290 Mexico "yaks", because they came from the Yaqui Injun country,
F35 1300 or gave 'em the name of "Mexican buckskins". Near the southern
F35 1310 border, cattle of the early longhorn breed whose coloration was black
F35 1320 with a lineback, with white speckles frequently appearin' on the
F35 1330 sides and belly, were called "zorrillas". This word was from the
F35 1340 Spanish, meanin' "polecat". "Yeller bellies" were cattle
F35 1350 of Mexican breed splotched on flank and belly with yellerish color. An
F35 1360 animal with distinct coloration, or other marks easily distinguished
F35 1370 and remembered by the owner and his riders, was sometimes used as a
F35 1380 "marker". Such an animal has frequently been the downfall of the
F35 1390 rustler.   Countin' each grazin' bunch of cattle where it was
F35 1400 found on the range and driftin' it back so that it didn't mix with
F35 1410 the uncounted cattle was called a "range count". The countin'
F35 1420 of cattle in a pasture without throwin' 'em together for the purpose
F35 1430 was called a "pasture count". The counters rode through the
F35 1440 pasture countin' each bunch of grazin' cattle, and drifted it back
F35 1450 so that it didn't get mixed with the uncounted cattle ahead. This
F35 1460 method of countin' was usually done at the request, and in the presence,
F35 1470 of a representative of the bank that held the papers against the
F35 1480 herd. Them notes and mortgages were spoken of as "cattle paper".
F35 1490    A "book count" was the sellin' of cattle by the books,
F35 1500 commonly resorted to in the early days, sometimes much to the profit of
F35 1510 the seller. This led to the famous sayin' in the Northwest of the
F35 1520 "books won't freeze". This became a common byword durin' the
F35 1530 boom days when Eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle
F35 1540 interests. The origin of this sayin' was credited to a saloonkeeper
F35 1550 by the name of Luke Murrin. His saloon was a meetin' place for
F35 1560 influential Wyoming cattlemen, and one year durin' a severe blizzard,
F35 1570 when his herd-owner customers were wearin' long faces, he said,
F35 1580 "Cheer up boys, whatever happens, the books won't freeze". In
F35 1590 this carefree sentence he summed up the essence of the prevailin'
F35 1600 custom of buyin' by book count, and created a sayin' which has survived
F35 1610 through the years. "Range delivery" meant that the buyer, after
F35 1620 examinin' the seller's ranch records and considerin' his rep'tation
F35 1630 for truthfulness, paid for what the seller claimed to own,
F35 1640 then rode out and tried to find it.   When a cowhand said that a
F35 1650 man had "good cow sense", he meant to pay 'im a high compliment.
F35 1660 No matter by what name cattle were called, there was no denyin' that
F35 1670 they not only saved Texas from financial ruin, but went far toward
F35 1680 redeemin' from a wilderness vast territories of the Northwest. #@
F35 1690 21 @ SWINGIN' A WIDE LOOP# THE first use of the word
F35 1700 "rustler" was as a synonym for "hustler", becomin' an established
F35 1710 term for any person who was active, pushin', and bustlin' in
F35 1720 any enterprise. Again it was used as the title for the hoss wrangler,
F35 1730 and when the order was given to go out and "rustle the hosses",
F35 1740 it meant for 'im to go out and herd 'em in. Eventually herdin'
F35 1750 the hosses was spoken of as "hoss rustlin'", and the wrangler was
F35 1760 called the "hoss rustler". Later, the word became almost exclusively
F35 1770 applied to a cow thief, startin' from the days of the maverick
F35 1780 when cowhands were paid by their employers to "get out and rustle
F35 1790 a few mavericks".
F36 0010 IT WAS JOHN who found the lion tracks. He found them near the carcass
F36 0020 of a zebra that had been killed the night before, and he circled
F36 0030 once, nose to the ground, hair shooting up along his back, as it did
F36 0040 when he was after lion or bear, and then he lifted his head and bayed,
F36 0050 and the pack joined in, all heads high, and Jones knew it was a hot
F36 0060 trail.   He stifled the Comanche yell and let John lead him
F36 0070 straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain. This mountain was
F36 0080 known as The Black Reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about
F36 0090 two hundred feet, honeycombed with caves, top covered with dense scrub
F36 0100 and creepers and tall grass. On the south it ended sharply as though
F36 0110 the lava had been cut off there suddenly.   Kearton and Ulyate
F36 0120 had started the day together while Jones followed the dogs, and Means
F36 0130 and Loveless had taken another route, and now, with the discovery
F36 0140 of the fresh trail still unknown to him, Ulyate reined in, in the
F36 0150 shadow of the Reef and pointed. Kearton focussed his field glasses.
F36 0160    "That's the Colonel", he said, "But I can't see the
F36 0170 dogs".   As they watched, Jones rode straight for the Reef.
F36 0180 Then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front
F36 0190 of him. The dogs were working a trail- lion? hyena? The pack
F36 0200 had made a bend to the north, swinging back toward the Reef, and Kearton
F36 0210 and Ulyate could hear them faintly.   Kearton got off and
F36 0220 tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled
F36 0230 it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring Loveless
F36 0240 and Means and the rest of the party.   "Not yet", cautioned
F36 0250 Ulyate.   Jones came toward them fast, now, along the southern
F36 0260 toe of the Reef, and the dogs could be heard plainly, Old John
F36 0270 with his Grand Canyon voice outstanding above the others. There
F36 0280 was Sounder, too, also a veteran of the North Rim, and Rastus and
F36 0290 the Rake from a pack of English fox-hounds, and a collie from a London
F36 0300 pound, and Simba, a terrier **h. A motley pack, chosen for effectiveness,
F36 0310 not beauty. Jones was galloping close behind them leaning
F36 0320 down, cheering them on.   "Light it"! Ulyate said, and Kearton
F36 0330 touched a match to the pile of grass, blew on it and flame licked
F36 0340 out. He threw green stuff on it, and a thin blue column of smoke rose.
F36 0350    "That will fetch the gang and tell the Colonel where we
F36 0360 are".   Two quick shots sounded. Then there was a chorus of
F36 0370 wild barking and baying. Then the heavy roar of a lion.   Kearton
F36 0380 and Ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound.
F36 0390 It came from the top of the Reef not half a mile away. At the
F36 0400 base of the rocky hillside, they left their horses and climbed on foot.
F36 0410 The route was choked with rugged lava-rocks, creepers and bushes, so
F36 0420 thickly overgrown that when Kearton lost sight of Ulyate and called,
F36 0430 Ulyate answered from ten feet away. Nice country to meet a lion in
F36 0440 face to face. Ulyate and Kearton climbed on toward the sound of the
F36 0450 barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring of the lion, till they
F36 0460 came, out of breath, to the crest, and peering through the branches of
F36 0470 a bush, this is what Ulyate saw: Jones who had apparently (and actually
F36 0480 had) ridden up the nearly impassable hillside, sitting calmly on
F36 0490 his horse within forty feet of a full-grown young lioness, who was crouched
F36 0500 on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him, while the
F36 0510 dogs whirled around her.   Ulyate drew back with a start, and put
F36 0520 finger to lips, almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her
F36 0530 off, "The dogs have got her bayed **h. She's just the other side
F36 0540 of that bush"! And when they had drawn back a step he added:
F36 0550 "Jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her. Why she doesn't
F36 0570 charge him, I don't know. And he hasn't even got a knife on
F36 0580 him. He couldn't get away from her in this kind of ground **h. Careful,
F36 0590 don't disturb her". ## Jones had been about a hundred
F36 0600 and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the
F36 0610 Reef. She was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when
F36 0620 she saw him she rose to full height and roared, opening her mouth wide,
F36 0630 lashing her tail, and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in
F36 0640 irritation, as much as to say: "How dare you disturb me in my sacred
F36 0650 precinct"?   Intuition told him, however, that she was tired
F36 0660 and winded from the run up the Reef and would not charge, yet. He
F36 0670 moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her, being careful, because
F36 0680 he knew the female is less predictable than the male. (In the graveyard
F36 0690 at Nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game
F36 0700 hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso.
F36 0710 Of the thirty-four, seventeen had been killed by lions, and eleven out
F36 0720 of the seventeen by lionesses.) She snarled terribly but intuition
F36 0730 told
F36 0740 him, again, that she was bluffing, and he could see that half her
F36 0750 attention was distracted by the dogs. He threw the lasso. It was falling
F36 0760 over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front
F36 0770 of her on the rock. Even then, if she took one step forward he could
F36 0780 catch her. But John nipped her rear end- one lion's rear end
F36 0790 was as good as another to John, Africa, Arizona no matter- and she
F36 0800 changed ends and took a swipe at John, but he ducked back.   Jones
F36 0810 then recoiled his rope and threw again, this time hitting her on
F36 0820 the back but failing to encircle her. She whirled and faced him, roaring
F36 0830 terribly, and Ulyate, watching through the leaves, could not understand
F36 0840 why she did not charge and obliterate him, because he wouldn't
F36 0850 have much of a chance of getting away, in that thick growth, but she
F36 0860 seemed just a trace uncertain; while Jones, on the other hand, appeared
F36 0870 perfectly confident and Ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer.
F36 0880    From the lioness' point of view, this strange creature
F36 0890 on the back of another creature, lashing out with its long thin paw,
F36 0900 very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with. But
F36 0910 now she sank lower to the rock. Her roar changed to a growl. Her
F36 0920 tail
F36 0930 no longer lashed. Although she appeared more subdued and defeated,
F36 0940 Jones knew she was growing more dangerous. She was rested and could
F36 0950 mount a charge. Just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched,
F36 0960 and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet.
F36 0970 At this moment, Loveless and Means arrived, crashing through the undergrowth
F36 0980 with their horses, and distracted her, and she ran off a short
F36 0990 distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks. The dogs followed
F36 1000 her and she killed three and badly wounded Old John.   "We've
F36 1010 got to get her out of there"! Jones yelled, "or she'll
F36 1020 kill 'em all. Bring me the firecrackers".   For such an
F36 1030 emergency he had included Fourth-of-July cannon crackers as part of
F36 1040 their equipment. Lighting one he pitched it into the crevice, and the
F36 1050 lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed.   "Ain't she
F36 1060 a beauty, though"? called out Means as she ran.   "Don't
F36 1070 you go a step nearer her than I do", Jones warned, "and if
F36 1080 you do, go at a run so you'll have momentum"!   For two hours
F36 1090 they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of
F36 1100 the Reef, trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get
F36 1110 a good throw. But she clung to the rocks and brush, and the day wore
F36 1120 away. It was hot. The dogs were tired. The men were tired too. It
F36 1130 was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again. And the sun was
F36 1140 beginning to go down. If dark came they would lose her.   "I'll
F36 1150 get a pole", Jones said finally, "and I'll poke a noose
F36 1160 over her
F36 1170 head"!   At this moment she was crouched in a cave-like
F36 1180 aperture halfway down the Reef. Ulyate made no comment but his face
F36 1190 showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions' heads with poles,
F36 1200 and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago, not the gentler
F36 1210 ones of today, and this one was angry, with good reason. Loveless,
F36 1220 too, objected. "It won't work, Colonel".   "Just the
F36 1230 same we'll try it".   But without waiting for them to try it,
F36 1240 she scattered the dogs and shot down the Reef and out across the plain.
F36 1250    John led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out
F36 1260 behind, many of them trailing blood. John himself was bruised and
F36 1270 clawed from head to tail, but he was in this fight to the finish, running
F36 1280 almost as strongly now as in the morning.   She took refuge
F36 1290 on a tongue of land extending into a gully, crouched at the base of a
F36 1300 thorn tree, and waited for them to come up. She had chosen the spot well.
F36 1310 With the gully on three sides, she could be approached only along
F36 1320 the tongue of land. "Careful, now", Jones warned.   Means
F36 1330 tried her first. Very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding,
F36 1340 edging closer, watching for a chance to throw, but ready to spin and
F36 1350 run, rope whining about his head, horse edging tensely under him, but
F36 1360 the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close
F36 1370 proximity of the lion. They tell you horses go crazy at the sight
F36 1380 or smell of a bear or a lion, but these didn't.   Means edged
F36 1390 closer. She snarled warningly. Means spit and edged on. Again she
F36 1400 snarled, and again he edged. The pony was sidewise to her. With a whirling
F36 1410 jump, it could get into gear **h. However nothing on four legs
F36 1420 was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance, unless
F36 1430 it was a cheetah.   She charged. Means spun and spurred. For thirty
F36 1440 yards she gained rapidly. She was closing and within one more bound
F36 1450 would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay, but- and
F36 1460 here Jones and Loveless and Ulyate were holding breath for all they
F36 1470 were worth- she never quite caught up that last bound. Means held
F36 1480 steady one jump ahead of her. Then gradually he began to pull away.
F36 1490 A Western cowpony had outrun an African lion, from a standing start.
F36 1500 Photos showed later that she'd been about six feet from Means **h.
F36 1510 Of course the factor of head start made all the difference. How much
F36 1520 head start? No one knew exactly. That was the whole question.
F36 1530 Enough, was the answer.   The lioness quickly changed front, when
F36 1550 she saw she couldn't catch Means, and made for Jones. As she had
F36 1560 done with Means, she gained rapidly at first, but then Baldy began
F36 1570 to draw away. Somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the
F36 1580 determining point.   When Jones too drew away, she returned to
F36 1590 a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully, crouched low
F36 1600 and waited as before. This new position, however, gave the ropers a
F36 1610 better chance. There was room to make a quick dash past the bush and
F36 1620 throw as you went. So: Means edged around on the north side of her,
F36 1630 Jones moved in from the south. Tossing his rope and shouting he attracted
F36 1640 her attention. He succeeded almost too well, because once she
F36 1650 rose as if to charge, and he half wheeled his horse- he was within
F36 1660 fifty feet- but she sank back.   From behind her Means shot
F36 1670 forward at a run. Kearton began shouting, "Wait, wait- the camera's
F36 1680 jammed"! But Means kept on. He raced by within twenty feet
F36 1690 of her, roped her around the neck, but a lioness' neck is short and
F36 1700 thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off.
F37 0010 The missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was
F37 0020 once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies. But the time
F37 0030 came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was
F37 0040 looked upon as deficient in its essential life. The Christian education
F37 0050 of children, too, was once hardly more than a sideshow, but the day
F37 0060 came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church
F37 0070 school was thought of as failing in its duty.   The most serious
F37 0080 weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally
F37 0090 regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination
F37 0100 and a few interdenominational executives. Most pastors and laymen,
F37 0110 even though they believe it to be important, assume that the ecumenical
F37 0120 movement lies outside the province of their parishes. They may
F37 0130 even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the
F37 0140 "ecclesiastical Rover Boys", as someone has dubbed them, who like
F37 0150 to go to national and international assemblies, and have expense accounts
F37 0160 that permit them to do so.   As long as this point of view
F37 0170 prevails, the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt. The next
F37 0180 stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community.
F37 0190 Progress will take place far less through what is done in any
F37 0200 "summit conference" of the National Council or the World Council,
F37 0210 or even in offices of the denominational boards, than through what
F37 0220 happens in the communities where Christian people live together as neighbors.
F37 0230 The front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping
F37 0250 congregations of different traditions exist side by side. Until they
F37 0260 see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their
F37 0270 own attitudes, programs, and relationships, it will have an inevitable
F37 0280 aspect of unreality. As things now stand, there is a grievous disparity
F37 0290 between the unity in Christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings
F37 0300 and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any Main
F37 0310 Street in the nation. #THE ECUMENICAL CONGREGATION# The crux
F37 0320 of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation
F37 0330 between congregations in the same community. The decisive question
F37 0340 is what happens <within> each congregation and, finally, in the
F37 0350 minds and hearts of the individual members. It is here that the local
F37 0360 and ecumenical must meet. It is here that the ecumenical must become
F37 0370 local and the local become ecumenical.   It has become almost
F37 0380 trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be "carried down to the
F37 0390 grass roots". This way of describing the matter is unfortunate.
F37 0400 It implies two misconceptions. One is that whatever is ecumenical has
F37 0410 to do with some over-all organization at "the top" and needs only
F37 0420 to be understood at the so-called "lower levels". The truth, however,
F37 0430 is that the ecumenical church <is> just the local church in its
F37 0440 own true character as an integral unit of the whole People of God
F37 0450 throughout the world. The other misconception is that our ecumenical
F37 0460 problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide
F37 0470 extension and its interdenominational connections, now comprehended
F37 0480 by many national leaders, can be communicated to all congregations.
F37 0490 However needed this may be, the fundamental problem is not information
F37 0500 but active commitment to the total mission of the church of Christ
F37 0510 in the world.   The basic unit in the church, of whatever denominational
F37 0520 polity, is always the congregation. It is hardly possible
F37 0530 to emphasize this too much. Most people do not realize that the congregation,
F37 0540 as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face, personally
F37 0550 sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience
F37 0560 in daily relationships with one another, is unique. The idea that it
F37 0570 is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken. The Jewish synagogue
F37 0580 affords a parallel to the Christian congregation, but Hinduism,
F37 0590 Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism, Taoism, Shintoism, although they
F37 0600 have sacred scriptures, priests, spiritual disciplines, and places of
F37 0610 prayer, do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and
F37 0620 love. Their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an
F37 0630 altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with
F37 0640 a distinctive kind of fellowship.   How far the fellowship in most
F37 0650 local churches falls below what the New Testament means by <koinonia!>
F37 0660 What is now called Christian fellowship is often little more
F37 0670 than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind
F37 0680 of people one likes. The <koinonia> of Acts and of the Epistles
F37 0690 means sharing in a common relation to Christ. It is an experience of
F37 0700 a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate
F37 0710 indwelling of Christ in His people. As Dietrich Bonho^ffer puts
F37 0720 it, "Our community with one another consists solely in what Christ
F37 0730 has done to both of us". This may mean having fellowship in the church
F37 0740 with people with whom, on the level of merely human agreeableness,
F37 0750 we might prefer not to have any association at all. There is a vast
F37 0760 difference between the community of reconciliation which the New Testament
F37 0770 describes and the community of congeniality found in the average
F37 0780 church building.   Whenever a congregation really sees itself
F37 0790 as a unit in the universal Church, in vital relation with the whole
F37 0800 Body of Christ and participating in His mission to the world, a necessary
F37 0810 foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid. The
F37 0820 antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists. The
F37 0830 local and the ecumenical are one.   Of course, the perspective
F37 0840 of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the
F37 0850 People of God will always be different from the perspective of those
F37 0860 who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a
F37 0870 particular place. Each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related
F37 0880 to the other. Neither is adequate if it stands alone. Our difficulty
F37 0890 arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other. And this is what
F37 0900 all too often happens. #DIVERGENT PERSPECTIVES# A little parable
F37 0910 illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by Professor
F37 0920 Bela Vasady at the end of the Second World War. With great
F37 0930 difficulty he made his way from his native Hungary to Geneva to renew
F37 0940 his contacts as a member of the Provisional Committee for the World
F37 0950 Council of Churches. When he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles,
F37 0960 his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new
F37 0970 ones. They were bifocals. He often spoke of them as his "ecumenical"
F37 0980 glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is
F37 0990 required in the church. It is, he said, a bifocal vision, which can
F37 1000 see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a Christian in right
F37 1010 relation to both.   As things stand now, the local and the ecumenical
F37 1020 tend to compete with each other. On the one hand, there are
F37 1030 ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter
F37 1040 with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church
F37 1050 is doing in their own town. They do not escape the pitfall into which
F37 1060 Charles Dickens pictured Mrs& Jellyby as falling. Her concern
F37 1070 for the natives of Borrioboola-Gha was so intense that she quite
F37 1080 forgot and neglected her son Peepy! Likewise, the ecumenist may become
F37 1090 so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian
F37 1100 state in East Germany, the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary
F37 1110 China, and the anguish of the church over apartheid in South
F37 1120 Africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its
F37 1130 unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship, pastoral service
F37 1140 and counseling, and Christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals.
F37 1150    On the other hand, many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering
F37 1160 to the intimate, personal needs of individuals in his congregation
F37 1170 that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social
F37 1180 responsibility and world mission. As a result, they go on thinking
F37 1190 of the church, with introverted and self-centered satisfaction, only
F37 1200 in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families.
F37 1210 It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of
F37 1220 the energy of most churches- whether in terms of finance or spiritual
F37 1230 concern- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the
F37 1240 members. The parish lives for itself rather than for the community or
F37 1250 the world.   The gap between the ecumenical perspective and the
F37 1260 parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable
F37 1270 suburbs. It is eminently successful according to all conventional
F37 1280 standards. It is growing in numbers. Its people are agreeable
F37 1290 friends. It has a beautiful edifice. Its preaching and its music give
F37 1300 refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain. It
F37 1310 provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled. It helps children
F37 1320 grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the Bible. It draws
F37 1330 young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the
F37 1340 church from generation to generation. And it is easy for the ecumenical
F37 1350 enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is.   But what
F37 1360 is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as Christians
F37 1370 in the world? All too often its conception of parish ministry
F37 1380 and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation
F37 1390 to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind.
F37 1400 It is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with
F37 1410 the mind of Christ. It is not helping them face the moral crisis
F37 1420 involved in the use of nuclear energy. It is not making them sensitive
F37 1430 to the sub-Christian level of much of our economic and industrial
F37 1440 life. It is raising no disturbing question as to what Christian stewardship
F37 1450 means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world
F37 1460 to economically underdeveloped peoples. It is not developing an awareness
F37 1470 of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young
F37 1480 churches emerge in Asia and Africa.   To put it bluntly, many
F37 1490 a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want.
F37 1500 It is not disturbing them by thoughts of their Christian responsibility
F37 1510 in relation to the world. We shall not make a decisive advance
F37 1520 in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not
F37 1530 merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of Christian witness
F37 1540 and mission to the world.   There is a humorous but revealing
F37 1550 story about a rancher who owned a large slice of Texas and who wanted
F37 1560 to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant
F37 1570 community. He built a school and a library, then a recreation center
F37 1580 and an inn. Desiring to fill the only remaining lack, he selected
F37 1590 the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting
F37 1600 it. A visitor to the beautiful little building inquired, "Do
F37 1610 you belong to this church, Mr& Rancher"? "Why, no, ma'am",
F37 1620 he replied, "this church belongs to me"! The story reflects
F37 1630 the way too many people feel. As long as the congregation regards
F37 1640 the church as "our" church, or the minister thinks of it as "my"
F37 1650 church, just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant
F37 1660 advance. There must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs
F37 1670 not to us but to Christ, and that it is His purpose, not our own interests
F37 1680 and preferences, that determines what it is to be and do. #LOCAL
F37 1690 EMBODIMENT OF THE WHOLE# A local church which conceives its function
F37 1700 to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and
F37 1710 concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an
F37 1720 extra, not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church. It would
F37 1730 doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical
F37 1740 it is really failing to be the Church of Christ.   Yet the
F37 1750 truth, according to the New Testament, is that every local church
F37 1760 has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in
F37 1770 that particular place.
F38 0010 Yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match
F38 0020 the boys from the neighboring farms; and buggies and wagons and chugging
F38 0030 Fords kept gathering all morning, until the edges of the field
F38 0040 were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field
F38 0050 to make fun of the visitors- whose pitcher was a formidable looking
F38 0060 young man with the only baseball cap.   This was a bitterly
F38 0070 fought game, carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight, with no
F38 0080 friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness
F38 0090 that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls
F38 0100 that went into the crowd. Every pitch in the game brought forth
F38 0110 a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors
F38 0120 dropped (and because their right fielder was still a little fuzzy from
F38 0130 drink, they dropped many) called forth yelps of derision.   At
F38 0140 one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting
F38 0150 as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in
F38 0160 the kidneys, he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled
F38 0170 over whether the ball was "dead" or the base runners were
F38 0180 free to score.   This was typical of such games, which were earnestly
F38 0190 played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of
F38 0200 good fellowship. When the visitors, after losing this game, rode along
F38 0210 the village streets toward home, the youngsters who could keep abreast
F38 0220 of them for a moment or two screamed triumphantly, "You bunch of
F38 0230 hay-shakers! G'ahn back home! You hay-shakers"!   Baseball
F38 0240 was surely the national game in those days, even though professional
F38 0250 baseball may have been merely a business. Radio broadcasts had
F38 0260 not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home,
F38 0270 in the town park or a pasture, with perhaps two or three trips to the
F38 0280 city each season to see the Cubs or the Pirates or the Indians or
F38 0290 the Red Sox.   Young men in school could look forward to playing
F38 0300 ball for money in a dozen different places, even if they failed to
F38 0310 make the major leagues. Nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might
F38 0320 find a payday awaiting him in the Three ~I League, or the Pony
F38 0330 League, or the Coastal Plains League, or the fast Eastern League,
F38 0340 if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere.
F38 0350 Even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams,
F38 0360 sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores,
F38 0370 that played two or three times a week throughout the summer, usually in
F38 0380 the cool of the evening, before an earnest and partisan audience who
F38 0390 did not begrudge a quarter each, or even more, to be dropped into a hat
F38 0400 when the game was half over.   Babe Ruth, of course, was everyone's
F38 0410 hero, and everyone knew him, even though relatively few ever
F38 0420 saw him play ball. His face was always in the newspapers, sometimes
F38 0430 in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life. As the twenties grew
F38 0440 older, and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more
F38 0450 and more people daily in the doings of the professionals, the great
F38 0460 hitters (always led by Babe Ruth) overshadowed the game so that pitchers
F38 0470 were nearly of no account. Boys no longer bothered learning to
F38 0480 bunt and even school kids scorned to "choke up" on a bat as Willie
F38 0490 Keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done.   Other
F38 0500 hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared
F38 0510 to dream of matching Ruth, who was still called Jidge by all his
F38 0520 friends, or Leo or Two-Head by those who dared to taunt him (Leo
F38 0530 was the name of the ball player he liked the least) and who called most
F38 0540 of the world "Kid". Lou Gehrig was given the nickname Buster,
F38 0550 and he ran Ruth a close race in home runs. But the nickname never
F38 0560 stuck and Gehrig was no match for Ruth in "color"- which is sometimes
F38 0570 a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field. Ruth
F38 0580 was a delinquent boy still, but he was in every way a great ball
F38 0590 player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone
F38 0600 to do it.   A few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities,
F38 0610 with the encouragement of the press, so that they might
F38 0620 see their names in big black print, along with Daddy Browning's,
F38 0630 Al Capone's, Earl Sande's, and the Prince of Wales'. One
F38 0635 who, for a time, succeeded
F38 0640 best and was still the sorriest of all was Charles
F38 0650 Arthur Shires, who called himself, in the newspapers, Art the
F38 0660 Great, or The Great Shires. It was his brag that he could beat
F38 0670 everybody at anything, but especially at fighting, and he once took on
F38 0680 the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists.
F38 0690 he was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond;
F38 0700 and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles
F38 0710 in Art's pocket once when he had occasion to collar the Great First
F38 0720 Baseman for some forgotten reason. (This made a sportswriter named
F38 0730 Pegler wonder in print if Art had worn this armament when he defeated
F38 0740 his manager.) The sorry fact about this young man, who was barely
F38 0750 of age when he broke into major-league baseball, was that he really
F38 0760 was a better ball player than he was given credit for being- never so
F38 0770 good as he claimed, and always an irritant to his associates, but a
F38 0780 good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate
F38 0790 on his skills or cut up in public.   In his minor way Charles
F38 0800 Arthur Shires was perhaps more typical of his era than Ruth was, for
F38 0810 he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these
F38 0820 Scott Fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers.
F38 0830 There were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down;
F38 0840 or who ingested strange objects, like live fish; or who undertook
F38 0850 to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor, with or without
F38 0860 a partner; or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without
F38 0870 pausing for breath. One young man, exhilarated to the point of insanity
F38 0880 by liquor and the excitement of the moment, performed a perfect
F38 0890 swan dive out of the stands at the Yale Bowl during the Yale-Army
F38 0900 football game, landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below,
F38 0910 and died at once.   But the twenties were not all insanity and
F38 0920 a striving after recognition. The business of baseball began to prosper
F38 0930 along with other entertainments, and performers- thanks partly to
F38 0940 George Herman Ruth's spectacular efforts each season to run his
F38 0950 salary higher and higher- prospered too. While fifty years before,
F38 0960 Albert Goodwill Spalding, secretary of the Chicago Ball Club of
F38 0970 the National League, could write earnestly to the manager of the Buffalo
F38 0980 club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball
F38 0990 game in August, in this Golden Era a game at the Yankee Stadium
F38 1000 might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate. And
F38 1010 while less than ten years earlier the wayward Black Sox- all of them
F38 1020 top performers in their positions- had toiled for stingy Charles
F38 1030 Comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five
F38 1040 hundred dollars a year, stars now were asking ten thousand dollars,
F38 1050 twenty thousand dollars, yes, even fifty thousand dollars a season.
F38 1060    The greatest team of this period was unquestionably the New
F38 1070 York Yankees, bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club
F38 1080 by men named Ed Barrow and Miller Huggins. Boston fans sometimes
F38 1090 liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the
F38 1100 great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the Red Sox- sold to millionaires
F38 1110 Huston and Ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most
F38 1120 trifling desire. Ruth himself, still owning his farm in Massachusetts
F38 1130 and an interest in the Massachusetts cigar business that printed
F38 1140 his round boyish face on the wrappers, had led the parade down from Fenway
F38 1150 Park, followed by pitchers Carl Mays, Leslie "Joe" Bush,
F38 1160 Waite Hoyt, Herb Pennock, and Sam Jones, catcher Wally Schang,
F38 1170 third baseman Joe Dugan (who completed the "playboy trio" of
F38 1180 Ruth, Dugan, and Hoyt), and shortstop Everett Scott. By 1926, when
F38 1190 the mighty Yanks were at their mightiest, only a few of these were
F38 1200 left but they still shone brightest, even beside able and agile rookies
F38 1210 like Tony Lazzeri (who managed never to have one of his epileptic
F38 1220 fits on the field), Mark Koenig, Lou Gehrig, George Pipgras, and
F38 1230 gray-thatched Earl Combs. The deeds of this team, through two seasons
F38 1240 and in the two World's Series that followed, have been written
F38 1250 and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said. But there
F38 1260 is one small episode that a few New York fans who happened to sit in
F38 1270 the cheap seats for one World's Series game in 1926 like best to
F38 1280 recall. Babe Ruth, as he always did in the Stadium, played right field
F38 1290 to avoid having the sun in his eyes, and Tommy Thevenow, a rather
F38 1300 mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the St& Louis Cardinals,
F38 1310 knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the
F38 1320 permanent stands and the wooden bleachers, where Ruth could not reach
F38 1330 it. The ball lay there, shining white on the grass in view of nearly
F38 1340 every fan in the park while Ruth, red-necked with frustration, charged
F38 1350 about the small patch of ground screaming, "Where's the -ing
F38 1360 ball"? But, as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over,
F38 1370 "not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me", so little Tommy
F38 1380 ran all the way home.   The ordinary man and woman, however, saw
F38 1390 little of the great professional games of those Golden Days, or of
F38 1400 any other sporting event for that matter. Promoters always hastened
F38 1410 to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators,
F38 1420 and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in
F38 1430 with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest
F38 1440 of any importance. Radio broadcasts, however- now that even plain
F38 1450 people could afford "loud speakers" on their sets- held old
F38 1460 fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones, chiefly women,
F38 1470 who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition,
F38 1480 became first inured, then attracted, then addicted to the long
F38 1490 afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park.
F38 1500    In some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on
F38 1510 weekends the announcer was silenced, and fans must needs drive to the
F38 1520 city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring.
F38 1530 This had a pleasant effect upon the Sunday gate receipts as well
F38 1540 as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies, some of which began
F38 1550 to offer special excursion rates, including seats at the park, just
F38 1560 as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new.
F38 1570 While women had always attended ball games in small numbers (it was the
F38 1580 part of a "dead game sport" in the early years of the twentieth
F38 1590 century to be taken out to the ball park and to root, root, root for
F38 1600 the home team), they had often sat in patient martyrdom, unable even to
F38 1610 read the scoreboard, which sometimes seemed to indicate that one
F38 1620 team
F38 1630 led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and
F38 1640 fifty-one. The questions women asked at baseball games were standard
F38 1650 grist for amateur comedy, as were the doings of women automobile drivers;
F38 1660 for every grown man (except a few who were always suspected of
F38 1670 being shy on virility) knew at least the fundamentals of baseball, just
F38 1680 as every male American in this era liked to imagine (or pretend) that
F38 1690 he could fight with his fists. And women were not expected to know
F38 1700 that the pitcher was trying <not> to let the batter hit the ball.
F38 1710    Radio, however, so increased the interest of women in the game
F38 1720 that it was hardly necessary even to have "Ladies' Days" any longer
F38 1730 to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home.
F38 1740 Women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands, where
F38 1750 they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice
F38 1760 stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears.
F38 1770    The radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative,
F38 1780 despite the baseball jargon, that girls and women could begin to
F38 1790 store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics
F38 1800 that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their
F38 1810 lessons in school.
F39 0010 This conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores
F39 0020 will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the "ideal",
F39 0030 and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for
F39 0040 preserving the ideal.   Our discussion of this involves using
F39 0050 Erik Erikson's schema of "identity <vs&> identity diffusion"
F39 0060 as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto
F39 0070 the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers
F39 0080 from whose case histories we quoted earlier. Our discussion does not
F39 0090 utilize all the identity crises postulated by Erikson, but is intended
F39 0100 to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying
F39 0110 unwed mothers. We hope thereby to emphasize that, from a psychological
F39 0120 standpoint, the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous
F39 0130 long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy
F39 0140 through adolescence.   Hypothesizing a series of developmental
F39 0150 stages that begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old
F39 0160 age, Erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series
F39 0170 of identity crises. The successful and positive resolution of these
F39 0180 crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle- during
F39 0190 adolescence, the individual's positive resolutions in each area of identity
F39 0200 crisis depend, to a considerable degree, on his already having
F39 0210 resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy,
F39 0220 childhood, and early adolescence. Within Erikson's schema, the
F39 0230 adolescent's delinquent behavior- in this case, her unwed motherhood-
F39 0240 reflects her "identity diffusion", or her inability to resolve
F39 0250 these various identity crises positively.   <The adolescent
F39 0260 experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs& time diffusion>.
F39 0270 Time perspective- the ability to plan for the future and
F39 0280 to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range
F39 0290 objectives- is more easily developed if, from infancy on, the individual
F39 0300 has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which
F39 0310 she lives. Erikson has noted that, unless this trust developed early,
F39 0320 the time ambivalence experienced, in varying degree and temporarily,
F39 0330 by all adolescents (as a result of their remembering the more immediate
F39 0340 gratification of wants during childhood, while not yet having fully
F39 0350 accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood) may develop
F39 0360 into a more permanent sense of time diffusion. Experience of this time
F39 0370 diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate
F39 0380 urgency to act immediately.   These polar extremes in time
F39 0390 diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported
F39 0400 in earlier chapters. Some of these mothers, apparently feeling a
F39 0410 desperate urgency, made, on the spur of the moment, commitments, in love
F39 0420 and sex, that would have life-long consequences. Others displayed
F39 0430 utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future.
F39 0440 For many of these unwed mothers, the data on their family life
F39 0450 and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources
F39 0455 of their
F39 0460 basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in
F39 0470 general.   However, as Erickson has noted, the individual's
F39 0480 failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood
F39 0490 need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of
F39 0500 identity diffusion in his (or her) adolescence. And, as shown in Chapter
F39 0510 /6,, some ~SNP females originally developed such trust only
F39 0520 during their adolescence, through the aid of, and their identification
F39 0530 with, alter-parents. In the specific case of time diffusion, we
F39 0540 must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust
F39 0560 <when it is combined with> the inevitable time crisis experienced by
F39 0570 most (if not all) adolescents in our society, and with the failure of
F39 0580 the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust.
F39 0590    <The adolescent experiences two closely related crises: self-certainty
F39 0600 vs& an identity consciousness; and role-experimentation
F39 0610 vs& negative identity>. A sense of self-certainty and the freedom
F39 0620 to experiment with different roles, or confidence in one's own unique
F39 0630 behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity, is more easily
F39 0640 developed during adolescence if, during early childhood, the individual
F39 0650 was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some
F39 0660 autonomy.   However, if the child has been constantly surrounded,
F39 0670 during nursery and early school age, by peer groups; inculcated
F39 0680 with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards; and allowed
F39 0690 little initiative in early play and work patterns- then in adolescence
F39 0700 her normal degree of vanity, sensitivity, and preoccupation with
F39 0710 whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable, will be compounded.
F39 0720 Her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions
F39 0730 and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence
F39 0740 are the manifestations, in her adolescence, of her having been indoctrinated
F39 0750 in childhood to feel shame, if not guilt, for failing to behave
F39 0760 in a manner acceptable to, and judged by, the performance of her nursery-
F39 0770 and elementary-school peer friends. To be different is to invite
F39 0780 shame and doubt; and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one's
F39 0790 parents, who already consider one different and difficult to understand,
F39 0800 than by one's peers, who are also experiencing a similar groping
F39 0810 for and denial of adult status.   The attitudes of some unwed
F39 0820 mothers quoted in Chapter /2,, revealed both considerable preoccupation
F39 0830 with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty.
F39 0840 Many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable
F39 0850 means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others; but
F39 0860 very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need
F39 0870 to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and
F39 0880 with one's self.   <Another identity crisis confronting the
F39 0890 adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs& work-paralysis>.
F39 0900 The adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise
F39 0910 the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends
F39 0920 on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy, initiative, and
F39 0930 self-discipline during childhood. The developmental process involves
F39 0940 the individual's progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement
F39 0950 resulting from having completed tasks, having kept commitments,
F39 0960 and having created something (however small or simple- even a doll
F39 0970 dress of one's own design rather than in the design "it ought
F39 0980 to be"). These childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty
F39 0990 that the adolescent needs, for experimenting with many roles, and
F39 1000 for the <freedom to fail sometimes> in the process of exploring and
F39 1010 discovering her skills and abilities.   If she has not had such
F39 1020 experiences, the female's normal adolescent degree of indecision will
F39 1030 be compounded. She may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted
F39 1040 with present and future alternatives- e&g&, whether to prepare
F39 1050 primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker; whether
F39 1060 to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself
F39 1070 while attending school; whether to pursue a college education or a
F39 1080 job after high school; and whether to attend this or that college and
F39 1090 to follow this or that course of study. Erikson has noted that, as
F39 1100 this indecision mounts, it may result in a "paralysis of workmanship".
F39 1110 This paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting- and
F39 1120 never completing- many jobs, tasks, and courses of study; and in
F39 1130 the fact that she bases her decisions about work, college, carreer, and
F39 1140 studies on what others are doing, rather than on her own sense of identity
F39 1150 with given skills, abilities, likes, and dislikes. The absence,
F39 1170 during her childhood and early adolescence, of experiences in developing
F39 1180 the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability- experiences
F39 1190 that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement-
F39 1200 and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy
F39 1210 and initiative in play and expression, both tend in her adolescence
F39 1220 to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally
F39 1230 in experimenting.   The comments made by some unwed mothers
F39 1240 (quoted in Chapter /2,) reflect this paralysis of workmanship. They
F39 1250 attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions
F39 1260 others made; they accepted a job primarily because it was available,
F39 1270 convenient, and paid reasonably. These things both express and,
F39 1280 at the same time, continue contributing to, their identity diffusion
F39 1290 in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and
F39 1300 self-certainty. As their identity diffusion increased, they became more
F39 1310 susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs. These
F39 1320 affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities
F39 1330 containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship,
F39 1340 no sense of dignity derived from a job well done.   Childhood
F39 1350 experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context
F39 1360 of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance
F39 1370 for the prevention of illegitimacy. The excerpts from case histories
F39 1380 presented above confirm this significance, though through different
F39 1390 facets of experience. For example, some unwed mothers had had no work
F39 1400 experiences, household chores, and responsibilities during childhood
F39 1410 and early adolescence; they subsequently occupied their leisure hours
F39 1420 in searching for something exciting and diverting. Sex was both. On
F39 1430 the other hand, some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility
F39 1440 imposed on them at an early age, and had thus had so little freedom
F39 1450 or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative, that their work
F39 1460 and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens- to be escaped
F39 1470 and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden
F39 1480 sexual behavior.   <The adolescent also faces the identity
F39 1490 crisis that Erikson has termed ideological polarization vs& diffusion
F39 1500 of ideals>. In discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations
F39 1510 for the prevention of illegitimacy, we shall again superimpose
F39 1520 Erikson's concept on our data.   Adolescents have a much-discussed
F39 1530 tendency to polarize ideas and values, to perceive things as
F39 1540 "either-or", black or white- nuances of meaning are relatively
F39 1550 unimportant. This tendency is, perhaps, most clearly revealed in the
F39 1560 literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents. Erikson
F39 1570 has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily
F39 1580 resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly
F39 1590 changing and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and adulthood.
F39 1600 It provides identification- with an idea, a value, a cause that
F39 1610 cuts through, or even transcends, the multiple and ambivalent identities
F39 1620 of their passage from child to adult, and permits their forceful
F39 1630 and overt expression of emotion.   The positive development, during
F39 1640 adolescence, of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with
F39 1650 increasing independence, and to identify overtly either with or against
F39 1660 given ideas, values, and practices, depends to a considerable degree
F39 1670 on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy,
F39 1680 initiative, and self-certainty. Most adolescents have some ideological
F39 1690 diffusion at various developmental stages, as they experience a proliferation
F39 1700 of ideas and values. The diffusion is most pronounced and
F39 1710 most likely to become fixed, however, in those who have had no or very
F39 1720 minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could
F39 1730 have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources
F39 1740 of developing self-certainty.   A pronounced ideological
F39 1750 diffusion- i&e&, inability to <identify independently> with given
F39 1760 ideas and value systems- is reflected in many ways. For example,
F39 1770 it is evinced by the adolescent (or adult) whose beliefs and actions
F39 1780 represent primarily his rebellion and reaction again the ideas and behavior
F39 1790 patterns of others, rather than his inner conviction and choice.
F39 1800 It is mirrored by the individual Willie Lohmans, whose ideas and
F39 1810 behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide
F39 1820 with those of the individual or group present and most important
F39 1830 at the moment. In another sense, it is represented in the arguments
F39 1840 of the "true believers" who seek to disprove the validity of all
F39 1850 other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs.
F39 1860    The case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological
F39 1870 diffusion, embodied in the unwed mother's inability to <identify
F39 1880 independently> with a given value system or behavior pattern, and
F39 1890 her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility
F39 1900 for her sexual behavior. For example, the unwed mothers expressed
F39 1910 their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly "what
F39 1920 it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly".
F39 1930 They were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital
F39 1940 sexual intercourse. They condemned the movie script writers for implying
F39 1950 that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating. They criticized parents
F39 1960 for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong;
F39 1970 and they censured parents who "never disciplined and were too permissive"
F39 1980 or who "never explained how easy it was to get pregnant".
F39 1990    In the adult world, there are a number of rather general and
F39 2000 diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the
F39 2010 adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis.
F39 2020 For example, some contemporary writing tends to fuse the "good
F39 2030 guys" and the "bad guys", to portray the weak people as heroes and
F39 2040 weakness as a virtue, and to explain (or even justify) asocial behavior
F39 2050 by attributing it to deterministic psychological, familial, and social
F39 2060 experiences.
F40 0010 In the final accounting, these would have augmented the bill for both
F40 0020 sides. An estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive.
F40 0030    Yet the huge amount of money consumed by the Selden litigation,
F40 0040 which many regarded as wasteful, indirectly contributed to constructive
F40 0050 changes in legal procedure. The duration and other circumstances
F40 0060 of the Selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of
F40 0070 patent infringement actions. The suit, as we have seen, came before
F40 0080 the courts when patent attorneys, inventors, and laymen were making mounting
F40 0090 demands for reforms in the American patent system. Chief among
F40 0100 the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures
F40 0110 in equity.   In a long and angry footnote to his opinion,
F40 0120 Judge Hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism.
F40 0130 "It is a duty", said Hough, "not to let pass this opportunity
F40 0140 of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony
F40 0150 in Equity, current in this circuit (and probably others), excused
F40 0160 if not justified by the rules of the Supreme Court, especially to
F40 0170 be found in patent causes, and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation.
F40 0180 As long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition,
F40 0190 rather than <viva voce> before an authoritative judicial officer,
F40 0200 I fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged, and expensive
F40 0210 prolixity remain the best known characteristic of Equity". Observing
F40 0220 that "reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible
F40 0230 examples", Hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing
F40 0240 procedures. He cited the elephantine dimensions of the Selden case
F40 0250 record; the duplication of testimony and exhibits; the numerous
F40 0260 squabbles over minor matters; the "objections stated at outrageous
F40 0270 length"; and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts, "uncalled
F40 0280 for and
F40 0290 unjustifiable, from the retort discourteous to the lie direct".
F40 0300    The fundamental difficulty of which the Selden case was
F40 0310 "a striking (though not singular) example", concluded Hough, "will
F40 0320 remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial
F40 0330 officer present, and responsible for the maintenance of discipline,
F40 0340 and the reception or exclusion of testimony".   Not least
F40 0350 among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment
F40 0360 were those who had participated in the Selden suit. William A&
F40 0370 Redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under
F40 0380 rules of evidence, the testimony would have been completed in sixty
F40 0390 days instead of five years. Inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for
F40 0400 reform, inevitably centering upon the Selden litigation as a "horrible
F40 0410 example". Its costive deliberations were likened to those of
F40 0420 the British courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by Dickens in
F40 0430 <Bleak House>.   Parker, who agreed with much of this criticism,
F40 0440 did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects. But
F40 0450 he felt that the Selden case was being unfairly pilloried. In a detailed
F40 0460 letter published in the <Scientific American> in 1912, he
F40 0470 remarked that "loose statements" about the case showed scant understanding
F40 0480 of the facts. The suit, although commonly designated as a single
F40 0490 action, actually embraced five cases. Parker insisted that the size
F40 0500 of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable
F40 0510 duplication of testimony.   In a private communication written
F40 0520 in 1911, Parker had been more to the point. Noting the complaints
F40 0530 of inventors and members of the patent bar, he admitted that some
F40 0540 of the strictures "were fairly well founded", but he added that under
F40 0550 existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group
F40 0560 of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent. The
F40 0570 vast industrial interests caught up in the Selden suit, as well as the
F40 0580 complex character of the automotive art, encouraged both sides to exploit
F40 0590 "every possible chance" for or against the patent, said Parker.
F40 0600 "This very seldom happens in this class or in other cases, and
F40 0610 of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the
F40 0620 record beyond what ordinarily would occur".   Parker listed the
F40 0630 remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony.
F40 0640 The most important of these found him in agreement with Hough's
F40 0650 plea for reform. Parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate
F40 0660 or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court
F40 0670 who had no authority to limit testimony. The taking of depositions,
F40 0680 he suggested, should be placed under a special court examiner empowered
F40 0690 to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial
F40 0700 testimony. "I am satisfied that in the Selden case had this power
F40 0710 existed and this course [been] pursued, it would have shortened
F40 0720 the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of
F40 0730 the other witnesses thereto more than that".   In the end Hough's
F40 0740 acidulous protest, which Parker called the "now somewhat famous
F40 0750 note on this 'Selden' case", did not go unheeded. In 1912
F40 0760 the United States Supreme Court adopted a new set of rules of equity
F40 0770 which became effective on February 1, 1913. The revised procedure
F40 0780 was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform. Under the new rules, testimony
F40 0790 is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary
F40 0800 character. Other expeditious methods are designed to prevent
F40 0810 prolixity, limit delays, and reduce the expense of infringement suits.
F40 0820 One of the A&L&A&M& lawyers observed that if the Selden
F40 0830 case had been tried under this simplified procedure, the testimony
F40 0840 which filled more than a score of volumes, "at a minimum cost of $1
F40 0850 a page for publication alone, could have been contained in one volume".
F40 0860 While patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive
F40 0870 forms of litigation, these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums
F40 0880 of money. There is little doubt that they were promulgated by the Supreme
F40 0890 Court as a direct result of the Selden patent suit. #3# Even
F40 0900 before it was formally dissolved in 1912, the A&L&A&M&
F40 0910 was succeeded by the Automobile Board of Trade, the direct lineal
F40 0920 ancestor of the present-day Automobile Manufacturers Association.
F40 0930 The trade bodies which came in the wake of the A&L&A&M&
F40 0940 were more representative, for they never adopted a policy of exclusion.
F40 0950 Nevertheless, it is from the Selden organization that the industry
F40 0960 inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests
F40 0970 of the trade. One of the chief features of this community of interest
F40 0980 is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement, a milestone
F40 0990 in the development of American industrial cooperation. Its origin
F40 1000 lies in the Selden patent controversy and its aftermath.   From
F40 1010 the earliest days of the motor car industry, before the A&L&A&M&
F40 1020 was established, patent infringement loomed as a serious and
F40 1030 vexing problem. Many patent contests were waged over automobile components
F40 1040 and accessories, among them tires, detachable rims, ball bearings,
F40 1050 license brackets, and electric horns. The fluidity and momentum of
F40 1060 the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims. As
F40 1070 early as 1900 a Wall Street combination acquired detail patents with
F40 1080 the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers.
F40 1090 This scheme failed, and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement
F40 1100 suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest
F40 1110 in 1912.   In this tangle of conflicting claims, the patent-sharing
F40 1120 scheme adopted by the A&L&A&M& at its founding proved
F40 1130 to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant
F40 1140 litigation. The interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty
F40 1150 eliminated infringement suits among the members of the A&L&A&M&
F40 1160 patent pool (although it did not protect them against outside
F40 1170 actions) and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive
F40 1180 technology. One of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition
F40 1190 upon the withholding of patent rights among A&L&A&M& members.
F40 1200 Within its limits, this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics
F40 1210 of a cross-licensing agreement. Its positive features
F40 1220 outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly.
F40 1230 Since the A&L&A&M& holdings embraced only about twenty-five
F40 1240 per cent of motor vehicle patents, the denial of rights to independent
F40 1250 companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors
F40 1260 of the industry. The highly important Dyer patents on the sliding
F40 1270 gear transmission were held by the A&L&A&M& pool. But Henry
F40 1280 Ford used the planetary transmission in his Model ~T and earlier
F40 1290 cars and, in 1905, as a precautionary measure, took out a license
F40 1300 from the man who claimed to be its inventor.   For those affiliated
F40 1310 with it, the A&L&A&M& pool was a haven from the infringement
F40 1320 actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting
F40 1330 intensity after 1900. By 1910 the courts were crowded with cases,
F40 1340 many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions.
F40 1350 It was commonplace for auto makers, parts-suppliers, and dealers
F40 1360 to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their
F40 1370 daily mail. "Purely from the business man's standpoint and without
F40 1380 regard to the lawyer's view", commented a trade journal, "the
F40 1390 matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing
F40 1400 some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents
F40 1410 are to become weapons of warfare in business, instead of simple beneficient
F40 1420 protection devices for encouraging inventive creation".
F40 1430    Occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain
F40 1440 prospect of legal complications. One manufacturer who held an allegedly
F40 1450 basic patent said: "I would readily put over $50,000 into the
F40 1460 manufacture of the device, but it is so easy to make that we would enter
F40 1470 immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would
F40 1480 eat up all our profits". The prevailing view in the industry was
F40 1490 summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a Senate committee:
F40 1500 "The exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions,
F40 1510 including delays surrounding legal disputes, particularly in patent
F40 1520 litigation, are items of industrial burden which must be written
F40 1530 large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste".
F40 1540    By that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping
F40 1550 constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical
F40 1560 information. At this point Charles C& Hanch, long an advocate
F40 1570 of patent peace in the industry, became chairman of the patents committee
F40 1580 of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce, successor
F40 1590 to the Automobile Board of Trade. Hanch was treasurer of the Nordyke
F40 1600 + Marmon Company, an Indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling
F40 1610 machinery before producing the Marmon car in 1904. He had
F40 1620 first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety
F40 1630 per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890's.
F40 1640 Anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry,
F40 1650 Hanch went to Detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading
F40 1660 A&L&A&M& members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan.
F40 1670 The breach created by the Selden patent doomed his proposal, but Hanch
F40 1680 did not abandon his scheme.   After the demise of the A&L&A&M&,
F40 1690 the time was propitious for establishing such a pool.
F40 1700 Most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal
F40 1710 interchange of patents. "It is a much easier course to agree to
F40 1720 let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned", said
F40 1730 a trade authority, "than to continue the costly effort of straightening
F40 1740 the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system,
F40 1750 which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day".
F40 1760    With the other members of the patents committee- Wilfred C& Leland,
F40 1770 Howard E& Coffin, Windsor T& White, and W& H&
F40 1780 Vandervoort- Hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential
F40 1790 feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution. The
F40 1800 plan was supported by Frederick P& Fish, counsel for the National
F40 1810 Automobile Chamber of Commerce. It will be recalled that in his
F40 1820 summation for the A&L&A&M& before Judge Hough, Fish had
F40 1830 condemned patent litigation as the curse of the American industrial
F40 1840 community. He was well aware that some inventors and their allies used
F40 1850 their patents solely for nuisance value. "My personal view is that
F40 1860 not one patented invention in ten is worth making", he later told
F40 1870 a Congressional committee. The eloquent persuasions of Fish guaranteed
F40 1880 the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association.
F40 1890    Drawn up in 1914, the cross-licensing agreement became
F40 1900 effective in 1915. It remained in force for ten years and has been
F40 1910 renewed at five-year intervals since 1925.
F41 0010 A little farther along the road you come to the {Church of Santa
F41 0020 Sabina,} called the "Pearl of the Aventine". Continue another
F41 0030 hundred yards to the {Piazza of the Knights of Malta.} On the
F41 0040 wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments.
F41 0050 The massive {gate} of the Maltese villa affords one of
F41 0060 the most extraordinary views in Rome. If you look through the keyhole,
F41 0070 you will see an artistically landscaped garden with the white dome
F41 0080 of St& Peter's framed in a long avenue of cropped laurel trees.
F41 0090    Retrace your steps a few yards on the Via di Santa Sabina and
F41 0100 turn right on the {Via di S& Alessio,} a street lined with
F41 0110 stately homes. Oleanders, cypress, and palms in the spacious gardens
F41 0120 add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section. Turn
F41 0130 left a block or so before the street ends, and then turn right down
F41 0140 the Via di Santa Prisca to the {Viale Aventino.} Here you can
F41 0150 pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city.
F41 0160 #THE RENAISSANCE CITY# _TO THE PIAZZA NAVONA AND PANTHEON_
F41 0170 These two walks take you through the {heart of Rome.} You will
F41 0180 walk some of the narrow, old streets, hemmed in by massive <palazzi>.
F41 0190 You will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed,
F41 0200 a magnificent square, the main shopping district, the Spanish
F41 0210 Steps, and the lovely Pincian Gardens. By seeing such varied places,
F41 0220 both interesting and beautiful, you will become aware of the many
F41 0230 different civilizations Rome has lived through, and in particular, get
F41 0240 a feel of Renaissance Rome. You will realize why Rome is indeed
F41 0250 the Eternal City.   Start on the Via d& Teatro di Marcello
F41 0260 at the foot of the {Capitoline Hill.} The majestic circular
F41 0270 tiers of stone of the {Theatre of Marcellus} give you some idea
F41 0280 of the huge edifice that the Emperor Augustus erected in 13 B&C&.
F41 0290 Twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in Roman days.
F41 0300 Andrea Palladio, an Italian architect of the sixteenth century, modeled
F41 0310 his designs on its Doric and Ionic columns.   Wander past
F41 0320 the three superb {Columns of Apollo} by the arches of the theatre.
F41 0330 The remains of the {Portico of Octavia} are now in front of
F41 0340 you. Climb the steps from the theatre to the Via della Tribuna di
F41 0350 Campitelli for an even better view of the Columns of Apollo.
F41 0360 Turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny Piazza Campitelli,
F41 0370 then proceed along the Via dei Funari to the Piazza Mattei. Here
F41 0380 is one of the loveliest fountains in Rome, the {Fontana delle
F41 0390 Tartarughe} or {"Fountain of the Tortoises".} It's typical
F41 0400 of Rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find
F41 0410 such an artistic work in the center of a little square. Stand here
F41 0420 for a few moments and look at this gem of a fountain with its four youths,
F41 0430 each holding a tortoise and each with a foot resting on the head
F41 0440 of a dolphin. The figures have been executed so skillfully that one
F41 0450 senses a great feeling of life and movement.   Opposite is the
F41 0460 {Palazzo Mattei,} one of Rome's oldest palaces, now the headquarters
F41 0470 of the {Italo-American Association.} Go inside for a closer
F41 0480 look at a Renaissance palace. In the first courtyard there are
F41 0490 some fine bas-reliefs and friezes, and in the second a series of delightful
F41 0500 terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered wall. The {Palazzo
F41 0510 Caetani,} still inhabited by the Caetani family, adjoins the Palazzo
F41 0520 Mattei.   Keep straight ahead on the Via Falegnami, cross
F41 0530 the wide Via Arenula, and you will come to the {Piazza B&
F41 0540 Cairoli,} where you should look in at the {Church of San Carlo
F41 0550 ai Catinari} to see the frescoes on the ceiling. Follow the colorful
F41 0560 and busy Via d& Giubbonari for a hundred yards or so. Now turn
F41 0570 left at the Via dell' Arco del Monte to the Piazza dei Pellegrini.
F41 0580 Just a few yards to the right on the Via Capo di Ferro will
F41 0590 bring you to the {Palazzo Spada,} built in 1540 and now occupied
F41 0600 by the {Council of State.} Paintings by Titian, Caravaggio,
F41 0610 and Rubens are on display (open 9:30-4:00).   Before you enter
F41 0620 the palazzo, note Francesco Borromini's facade. The great architect
F41 0630 also designed the fine interior staircase and colonnade which
F41 0640 connects the two courts. The large statue on the first floor is believed
F41 0650 to be the {statue of Pompey} at the base of which Julius Caesar
F41 0660 was stabbed to death (if so, the statue once stood in the senate
F41 0670 house). (This is shown in the afternoon and on Sunday morning.)
F41 0680    By tipping the porter, you can see in the courtyard Borromini's
F41 0690 unusual and fascinating trick in perspective. When you stand before
F41 0700 the barrel-vaulted {colonnade} you have the impression that the statue
F41 0705 at
F41 0710 the end is at a considerable distance, yet it is actually only a few
F41 0720 feet away. The sense of perspective has been created by designing the
F41 0730 length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade
F41 0740 are much shorter than those in front. The gardens of the <palazzo,>
F41 0750 shaded by a huge magnolia tree, are most attractive. The courtyard
F41 0760 is magnificently decorated.   From the Palazzo Spada you continue
F41 0770 another block along the Via Capo di Ferro and Vicolo de Venti
F41 0780 to the imposing {Palazzo Farnese,} begun in 1514 and considered
F41 0790 by many to be the finest palace of all. Michelangelo was the most distinguished
F41 0800 of several noted architects who helped design it. Today it
F41 0810 is occupied by the {French Embassy.} Its lovely seventeenth-century
F41 0820 ceiling frescoes, as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously
F41 0830 high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling, can be seen Sundays
F41 0840 (11:00-12:00 noon). Ask to see the modern tapestries of Paris
F41 0850 and Rome designed by Lurcat.   Directly in front of the palace
F41 0860 along the Via d& Baullari you will come to the {Campo di Fiori,}
F41 0870 the famous site of executions during the turbulent days of Renaissance
F41 0880 Rome. Today, by contrast it is a lively and colorful fruit,
F41 0890 vegetable, and flower market. Continue on the Via d& Baullari to
F41 0900 the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, then turn right for a couple of hundred
F41 0910 yards to the {Church of Sant' Andrea della Valle.} As you
F41 0920 approach the church on the Via d& Baullari you are passing within
F41 0930 yards of the remains of the {Roman Theatre of Pompey,} near which
F41 0940 is believed to have been the place where Julius Caesar was assassinated.
F41 0950 The dome of the church is, outside of {St& Peter's,}
F41 0960 one of the largest in Rome. Opera lovers will be interested to learn
F41 0970 that this church was the scene for the first act of <Tosca>.
F41 0980    At this point you cross the wide Corso Vittorio Emanuele /2,,
F41 0990 walk along the Corso del Rinascimento a couple of hundred yards,
F41 1000 then turn left on the Via dei Canestrani to enter the splendid {Piazza
F41 1010 Navona,} one of the truly glorious sights in Rome.   Your
F41 1020 first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains,
F41 1030 its two churches that almost face each other, and its russet-colored
F41 1040 buildings, is a sense of restful spaciousness- particularly
F41 1050 welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have
F41 1060 followed since starting this walk.   The site of the oblong
F41 1070 piazza is {Domitian's ancient stadium,} which was probably used
F41 1080 for horse and chariot races. For centuries it was the location of historic
F41 1090 festivals and open-air sports events. From the seventeenth to
F41 1100 the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in
F41 1110 the summer, and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated
F41 1120 square in their carriages.   Giovanni Bernini's {"Fountain
F41 1130 of the Rivers",} in the center of the piazza, is built around
F41 1140 a Roman obelisk from the Circus of Maxentius which rests on grottoes
F41 1150 and rocks, with four huge figures, one at each corner, denoting four
F41 1160 great rivers from different continents- the Danube, the Ganges, the
F41 1170 Nile, and the Plate. The eyes of the figure of the Nile are covered,
F41 1180 perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure
F41 1190 from her sight the baroque facade of the {Church of Sant' Agnese
F41 1200 in Agone}, the work of Bernini's rival, Borromini.
F41 1210 In the Piazza Navona there are many delightful cafes where you can
F41 1220 sit, have a drink or lunch, and watch the fountains in the square. The
F41 1230 scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about
F41 1240 Rome. Perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch.
F41 1250    Take the Via di S& Agnese in Agone, next to the church
F41 1260 and opposite the center of the square, then turn right after about
F41 1270 two hundred yards to reach the beautiful {Church of Santa Maria della
F41 1280 Pace.} Inside you will find the lovely Sibyls painted by Raphael
F41 1290 and a chapel designed by Michelangelo. The church's cloisters
F41 1300 are among Donato Bramante's most beautiful creations.   Now
F41 1310 return to the Piazza Navona and leave it on the opposite side by the
F41 1320 Corsia Agonale; in a moment cross the Corso del Rinascimento.
F41 1330 In front of you is the {Palazzo Madama,} once belonging to the
F41 1340 Medici and now the {Italian Senate.} Walk by the side of the
F41 1350 palazzo and after two blocks along the Via Giustiniani you will come
F41 1360 to the {Piazza della Rotonda.} You are now facing the {Pantheon,}
F41 1370 the largest and best-preserved building still standing from the
F41 1380 days of ancient Rome.   This circular edifice, constructed by
F41 1390 Agrippa in B&C& 27, was rebuilt in its present shape by the Emperor
F41 1400 Hadrian. It was dedicated as a church in the seventh century.
F41 1410 As you pause in the piazza by the Egyptian obelisk brought from the
F41 1420 Temple of Isis, you will admire the Pantheon's impressive Corinthian
F41 1430 columns.   The Pantheon's interior, still in its original
F41 1440 form, is truly majestic and an architectural triumph. Its {rotunda}
F41 1450 forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from
F41 1460 the floor to the ceiling. The only means of interior light is the
F41 1470 twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous {dome.} Standing
F41 1480 before the tomb of Raphael, the great genius of the Renaissance, when
F41 1490 shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great Roman temple, you are
F41 1500 once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of
F41 1510 Rome.   As you leave the Pantheon, take the narrow street to
F41 1520 the right, the Via del Seminario, a block to {Sant' Ignazio,}
F41 1530 one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city. (Along the way
F41 1540 there, about one hundred yards on your right, you pass a simple restaurant,
F41 1550 {La Sacrestia,} where you can have the best pizza in Rome.)
F41 1560 The curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church
F41 1570 seems like a stage set. This is one of the most charming little
F41 1580 squares in this part of Rome. One block along the Via de Burro (in
F41 1590 front of the church) will bring you to the {Stock Exchange} in
F41 1600 the old {Temple of Neptune.} A few yards farther, on the Via
F41 1610 dei Bergamaschi, is the {Piazza Colonna.} The great column from
F41 1620 which the square takes its name was erected by the Emperor Marcus
F41 1630 Aurelius.   You are now at the {Corso,} though narrow, one
F41 1640 of Rome's busiest streets. Horse races took place here in the Middle
F41 1650 Ages.   If you have taken this stroll in the morning, and you have
F41 1660 the time and inclination, walk to the right along the crowded Corso
F41 1670 for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings-
F41 1680 mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries- in the
F41 1690 {Palazzo Doria} (open Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, 10:00-1:00).
F41 1700 Here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where
F41 1710 the family still lives.   Otherwise, cross over the Corso and
F41 1720 walk a block or so to the left. You will come to {Alemagna,} a
F41 1730 delightful, though moderately expensive restaurant, which is particularly
F41 1740 noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries.
F41 1750 Either here, or in one of the modest restaurants nearby, is just the
F41 1760 place to end this first walk through the heart of Rome. _TO THE SPANISH
F41 1770 STEPS_ The second walk through the heart of Rome should be taken
F41 1780 after lunch, so that you will reach the {Pincian Hill} when
F41 1790 the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best.
F42 0010 Rare, indeed, is the Harlem citizen, from the most circumspect church
F42 0020 member to the most shiftless adolescent, who does not have a long tale
F42 0030 to tell of police incompetence, injustice, or brutality. I myself
F42 0040 have witnessed and endured it more than once. The businessmen and racketeers
F42 0050 also have a story. And so do the prostitutes. (And this is not,
F42 0060 perhaps, the place to discuss Harlem's very complex attitude toward
F42 0070 black policemen, nor the reasons, according to Harlem, that they
F42 0080 are nearly all downtown.)   It is hard, on the other hand, to blame
F42 0090 the policeman, blank, good-natured, thoughtless, and insuperably
F42 0100 innocent, for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves.
F42 0110 He, too, believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended
F42 0120 when they are not taken for the deed. He has never, himself, done
F42 0130 anything for which to be hated- which of us has?- and yet he is
F42 0140 facing, daily and nightly, people who would gladly see him dead, and he
F42 0150 knows it. There is no way for him not to know it: there are few things
F42 0160 under heaven more unnerving than the silent, accumulating contempt
F42 0170 and hatred of a people. He moves through Harlem, therefore, like
F42 0180 an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country; which is precisely
F42 0190 what, and where, he is, and is the reason he walks in twos and threes.
F42 0200 And he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company:
F42 0210 the people who are watching him know why, too. Any street meeting,
F42 0220 sacred or secular, which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as
F42 0230 its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white
F42 0240 domination. And these days, of course, in terms increasingly vivid and
F42 0250 jubilant, it speaks of the end of that domination. The white policeman
F42 0260 standing on a Harlem street corner finds himself at the very center
F42 0270 of the revolution now occurring in the world. He is not prepared
F42 0280 for it- naturally, nobody is- and, what is possibly much more to the
F42 0290 point, he is exposed, as few white people are, to the anguish of the
F42 0300 black people around him. Even if he is gifted with the merest mustard
F42 0310 grain of imagination, something must seep in. He cannot avoid observing
F42 0320 that some of the children, in spite of their color, remind him of
F42 0330 children he has known and loved, perhaps even of his own children. He
F42 0340 knows that he certainly does not want <his> children living this
F42 0350 way. He can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction: into
F42 0360 a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature. He becomes more
F42 0370 callous, the population becomes more hostile, the situation grows
F42 0380 more tense, and the police force is increased. One day, to everyone's
F42 0390 astonishment, someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything
F42 0400 blows up. Before the dust has settled or the blood congealed, editorials,
F42 0410 speeches, and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land, demanding
F42 0420 to know what happened. What happened is that Negroes want to
F42 0430 be treated like men.   <Negroes want to be treated like men:>
F42 0440 a perfectly straightforward statement, containing only seven words.
F42 0450 People who have mastered Kant, Hegel, Shakespeare, Marx, Freud,
F42 0460 and the Bible find this statement utterly impenetrable. The idea seems
F42 0470 to threaten profound, barely conscious assumptions. A kind of panic
F42 0480 paralyzes their features, as though they found themselves trapped on
F42 0490 the edge of a steep place. I once tried to describe to a very well-known
F42 0500 American intellectual the conditions among Negroes in the South.
F42 0510 My recital disturbed him and made him indignant; and he asked me
F42 0520 in perfect innocence, "Why don't all the Negroes in the South
F42 0530 move North"? I tried to explain what <has> happened, unfailingly,
F42 0540 whenever a significant body of Negroes move North. They do not
F42 0550 escape Jim Crow: they merely encounter another, not-less-deadly
F42 0560 variety. They do not move to Chicago, they move to the South Side;
F42 0570 they do not move to New York, they move to Harlem. The pressure
F42 0580 within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand, and this expansion
F42 0590 is always violent. White people hold the line as long as they can,
F42 0600 and in as many ways as they can, from verbal intimidation to physical
F42 0610 violence. But inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from
F42 0620 the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto. The white
F42 0630 people fall back bitterly before the black horde; the landlords make
F42 0640 a tidy profit by raising the rent, chopping up the rooms, and all but
F42 0650 dispensing with the upkeep; and what has once been a neighborhood
F42 0660 turns into a "turf". This is precisely what happened when the Puerto
F42 0670 Ricans arrived in their thousands- and the bitterness thus caused
F42 0680 is, as I write, being fought out all up and down those streets.
F42 0690    Northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury. They seem
F42 0700 to feel that because they fought on the right side during the Civil
F42 0710 War, and won, they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going
F42 0720 on in the South, without taking any responsibility for it; and
F42 0730 that they can ignore what is happening in Northern cities because what
F42 0740 is happening in Little Rock or Birmingham is worse. Well, in the
F42 0750 first place, it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both
F42 0760 to know which is "worse". I know Negroes who prefer the South and
F42 0770 white Southerners, because "At least there, you haven't got to
F42 0780 play any guessing games"! The guessing games referred to have driven
F42 0790 more than one Negro into the narcotics ward, the madhouse, or the
F42 0800 river. I know another Negro, a man very dear to me, who says, with
F42 0810 conviction and with truth, "The spirit of the South is the spirit
F42 0820 of America". He was born in the North and did his military training
F42 0830 in the South. He did not, as far as I can gather, find the South
F42 0840 "worse"; he found it, if anything, all too familiar. In the
F42 0850 second place, though, even if Birmingham <is> worse, no doubt
F42 0860 Johannesburg, South Africa, beats it by several miles, and Buchenwald
F42 0870 was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history
F42 0880 of the world. The world has never lacked for horrifying examples;
F42 0890 but I do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification
F42 0900 for our own crimes. This perpetual justification empties
F42 0910 the heart of all human feeling. The emptier our hearts become, the greater
F42 0920 will be our crimes. Thirdly, the South is not merely an embarrassingly
F42 0930 backward region, but a part of this country, and what happens
F42 0940 there concerns every one of us.   As far as the color problem
F42 0950 is concerned, there is but one great difference between the Southern
F42 0960 white and the Northerner: the Southerner remembers, historically and
F42 0970 in his own psyche, a kind of Eden in which he loved black people and
F42 0980 they loved him. Historically, the flaming sword laid across this Eden
F42 0990 is the Civil War. Personally, it is the Southerner's sexual
F42 1000 coming of age, when, without any warning, unbreakable taboos are set
F42 1010 up between himself and his past. Everything, thereafter, is permitted
F42 1020 him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need. The resulting,
F42 1030 indescribable torment affects every Southern mind and is the
F42 1040 basis of the Southern hysteria.   None of this is true for the
F42 1050 Northerner. Negroes represent nothing to him personally, except, perhaps,
F42 1060 the dangers of carnality. He never sees Negroes. Southerners
F42 1070 see them all the time. Northerners never think about them whereas Southerners
F42 1080 are never really thinking of anything else. Negroes are,
F42 1090 therefore, ignored in the North and are under surveillance in the South,
F42 1100 and suffer hideously in both places. Neither the Southerner nor
F42 1110 the Northerner is able to look on the Negro simply as a man. It seems
F42 1120 to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the Negro be
F42 1130 considered either as a kind of ward (in which case we are told how many
F42 1140 Negroes, comparatively, bought Cadillacs last year and how few,
F42 1150 comparatively,
F42 1160 were lynched), or as a victim (in which case we are promised
F42 1170 that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our
F42 1180 kids). They are two sides of the same coin and the South will not change-
F42 1190 <cannot> change- until the North changes. The country will
F42 1200 not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really
F42 1210 means by freedom. In the meantime, generations keep being born, bitterness
F42 1220 is increased by incompetence, pride, and folly, and the world shrinks
F42 1230 around us.   It is a terrible, an inexorable, law that one
F42 1240 cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's own:
F42 1250 in the face of one's victim, one sees oneself. Walk through the
F42 1260 streets of Harlem and see what we, this nation, have become. #4. EAST
F42 1270 RIVER, DOWNTOWN: POSTSCRIPT TO A LETTER FROM HARLEM#   THE
F42 1280 FACT THAT AMERICAN NEgroes rioted in the U&N& while Adlai
F42 1290 Stevenson was addressing the Assembly shocked and baffled most white
F42 1300 Americans. Stevenson's speech, and the spectacular disturbance
F42 1310 in the gallery, were both touched off by the death, in Katanga, the
F42 1320 day before, of Patrice Lumumba. Stevenson stated, in the course of
F42 1330 his address, that the United States was "against" colonialism. God
F42 1340 knows what the African nations, who hold 25 per cent of the voting
F42 1350 stock in the U&N& were thinking- they may, for example, have
F42 1360 been thinking of the U&S& abstention when the vote on Algerian
F42 1370 freedom was before the Assembly- but I think I have a fairly accurate
F42 1380 notion of what the Negroes in the gallery were thinking. I had
F42 1390 intended to be there myself. It was my first reaction upon hearing
F42 1400 of Lumumba's death. I was curious about the impact of this political
F42 1410 assassination on Negroes in Harlem, for Lumumba had- has- captured
F42 1420 the popular imagination there. I was curious to know if Lumumba's
F42 1430 death, which is surely among the most sinister of recent events,
F42 1440 would elicit from "our" side anything more than the usual, well-meaning
F42 1450 rhetoric. And I was curious about the African reaction.
F42 1460    However, the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the U&N&
F42 1470 gallery. Had I been there, I, too, in the eyes of most Americans,
F42 1480 would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the Communists. The
F42 1490 climate and the events of the last decade, and the steady pressure of
F42 1500 the "cold" war, have given Americans yet another means of avoiding
F42 1510 self-examination, and so it has been decided that the riots were "Communist"
F42 1520 inspired. Nor was it long, naturally, before prominent
F42 1530 Negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the U&N& rioters
F42 1540 do not represent the real feeling of the Negro community.
F42 1550 According, then, to what I take to be the prevailing view, these rioters
F42 1560 were merely a handful of irresponsible, Stalinist-corrupted <provocateurs>.
F42 1570    I find this view amazing. It is a view which even
F42 1580 a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict. One
F42 1590 has only, for example, to walk through Harlem and ask oneself two questions.
F42 1600 The first question is: Would <I> like to live here?
F42 1610 And the second question is: Why don't those who now live here move
F42 1620 out? The answer to both questions is immediately obvious. Unless
F42 1630 one takes refuge in the theory- however disguised- that Negroes
F42 1640 are, somehow, different from white people, I do not see how one can
F42 1650 escape the conclusion that the Negro's status in this country is
F42 1660 not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability.   Now,
F42 1670 I do not doubt that, among the people at the U&N& that day, there
F42 1680 were Stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the
F42 1690 most cynical motives. Wherever there is great social discontent, these
F42 1700 people are, sooner or later, to be found. Their presence is not as
F42 1710 frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity. What
F42 1720 I find appalling- and really dangerous- is the American assumption
F42 1730 that the Negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical
F42 1740 agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest. It is a notion
F42 1750 which contains a gratuitous insult, implying, as it does, that Negroes
F42 1760 can make no move unless they are manipulated.
F43 0010 Color was delayed until 1935, the wide screen until the early fifties.
F43 0020    Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction
F43 0030 of the primitive movies of the nineties. Each film consisted of fifty
F43 0040 feet, which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen.
F43 0050 As long as audiences came to see the movement, there seemed little reason
F43 0060 to adventure further. Motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores
F43 0070 in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can
F43 0080 still be found in such urban areas as Times Square. Brief snips of
F43 0090 actual events were shown: parades, dances, street scenes. The sensational
F43 0100 and frightening enjoyed popularity: a train rushes straight at
F43 0110 the audience, or a great wave threatens to break over the seats. An
F43 0120 early Edison production was <The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots>.
F43 0130 The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold; the headsman swung
F43 0140 his axe; the head dropped off; end of film. An early film by
F43 0150 a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo Park simply showed a long kiss
F43 0160 performed by two actors of the contemporary stage.   In the field
F43 0170 of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective
F43 0180 as audience boredom, and the first decade of the new device was not over
F43 0190 before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded,
F43 0200 one-minute shows. In response, the industry allowed the discovery
F43 0210 of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies
F43 0220 the essential form they have had to this day. Despite the sheer
F43 0230 beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries, art films, and travelogues,
F43 0240 despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development
F43 0250 as Cinerama, the movies are at heart a form of fiction, like the
F43 0260 play, the novel, or the short story. Moreover, the most artistically
F43 0270 successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative
F43 0280 form from the fiction feature. Thus such great American documentaries
F43 0290 as <The River> and <The Plow That Broke the Plains>
F43 0300 were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures.
F43 0310 The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early
F43 0320 years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men, a French
F43 0330 magician, Georges Melies, and an American employee of Edison, Edwin
F43 0340 S& Porter. Of the two, Porter is justly the better known, for
F43 0350 he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the
F43 0360 first step toward fashioning a language of film, toward making the motion
F43 0370 picture the intricate, efficient time machine that it has remained
F43 0380 since, even in the most inept hands. #NARRATIVE TIME AND FILM TIME#
F43 0390 Melies, however, out of his professional instincts as a magician,
F43 0400 discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain
F43 0410 part of the vocabulary of film. One of these is the "dissolve",
F43 0420 which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene.
F43 0430 As the first scene begins to fade, the succeeding scene begins
F43 0440 to appear. For a moment or two, both scenes are present simultaneously,
F43 0450 one growing weaker, one growing stronger. In a series of fairy tales
F43 0460 and fantasies, Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped
F43 0470 to tell a straightforward story, with beginning, middle and end, complications,
F43 0480 resolutions, climaxes, and conclusions. Immediately, the
F43 0490 film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content
F43 0500 based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time.
F43 0510 Physically, a movie is possible because a series of images is projected
F43 0520 one at a time at such a speed that the eye "remembers" the one
F43 0530 that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing. Linking
F43 0540 the smoothly changing images together, the eye itself endows them
F43 0550 with the illusion of movement. The "projection" time of painting
F43 0560 and sculpture is highly subjective, varying from person to person and
F43 0570 even varying for a given person on different occasions. So is the time
F43 0580 of the novel. The drama in the theater and the concert in the hall
F43 0590 both have a fixed time, but the time is fixed by the director and the
F43 0600 players, the conductor and the instrumentalists, subject, therefore,
F43 0610 to much variation, as record collectors well know. The time of the motion
F43 0620 picture is fixed absolutely. The film consists of a series of still,
F43 0630 transparent photographs, or "frames", 35-mm&-wide. Each frame
F43 0640 comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected
F43 0650 on the screen, at the rate, for silent movies, of 16 frames per second,
F43 0660 and, for sound films, 24 frames per second. This is the rate of projection;
F43 0670 it is also the rate of photographing. Time is built into
F43 0680 the motion picture, which cannot exist without time. Now time is also
F43 0690 the concern of the fictional narrative, which is, at its simplest,
F43 0700 the story of an action with, usually, a beginning, a middle, and an end-
F43 0710 elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence.
F43 0720 The "moving" picture of the train or the wave coming at the
F43 0730 audience is, to be sure, more intense than a still picture of the same
F43 0740 subject, but the difference is really one of degree; the cinematic
F43 0750 element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which
F43 0760 would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo. In narrative,
F43 0770 time is essential, as it is in film. Almost everything about the
F43 0780 movies that is peculiarly <of> the movies derives from a tension created
F43 0790 and maintained between narrative time and film time. This discovery
F43 0800 of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling,
F43 0810 magician's tricks produced on film.   It was Porter, however,
F43 0820 who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the
F43 0830 half century of film history that has since ensued. The movie was <The
F43 0840 Great Train Robbery> and its effects on the young industry and
F43 0850 art were all but incalculable. Overnight, for one thing, Porter's
F43 0860 film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten. <The
F43 0870 Great Train Robbery> is a one-reel film. One reel- from eight to
F43 0880 twelve minutes- became the standard length from the year of <Robbery>,
F43 0890 1903, until Griffith shattered that limit forever with <Birth of
F43 0900 a Nation> in 1915. The reel itself became and still is the standard
F43 0910 of measure for the movies.   The material of the Porter film
F43 0920 is simplicity itself; much of it has continued to be used over the
F43 0930 years and the heart of it- good guys and bad guys in the old West-
F43 0940 pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's. A
F43 0950 band of robbers enters a railroad station, overpowers and ties up the
F43 0960 telegraph operator, holds up the train and escapes. A posse is formed
F43 0970 and pursues the robbers, who, having made their escape, are whooping
F43 0980 it up with some wild, wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out. The robbers
F43 0990 run from the hide-out, take cover in a wooded declivity, and are shot
F43 1000 dead by the posse. As a finale is appended a close-up of one of the
F43 1010 band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience.
F43 1020    All this is simple enough, but in telling the story Porter did
F43 1030 two important things that had not been done before. Each scene is shot
F43 1040 straight through, as had been the universal custom, from a camera fixed
F43 1050 in a single position, but in the outdoor scenes, especially in the
F43 1060 capture and destruction of the outlaws, Porter's camera position
F43 1070 breaks, necessarily, with the camera position standard until then, which
F43 1080 had been, roughly, that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at
F43 1090 a play. The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the
F43 1100 plane of the film in the camera or on the screen. If the change, at
F43 1110 first sight, seems minor, we may recall that it took the Italian painters
F43 1120 about two hundred years to make an analogous change, and the Italian
F43 1130 painters, by universal consent, were the most brilliant group of
F43 1140 geniuses any art has seen. In that apparently simple shift Porter
F43 1150 opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of
F43 1160 art as well as a mechanical recording device.   He did more than
F43 1170 that. He revealed the potential value of the "cut" as the basic
F43 1180 technique in the art of the film. Cutting, of course, takes place automatically
F43 1190 in the creation of a film. The meaning of the word is quite
F43 1200 physical, to begin with. The physical film is cut with a knife at the
F43 1210 end of one complete sequence, and the cut edge is joined physically,
F43 1220 by cement, to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence. If,
F43 1230 as a home movie maker, you shoot the inevitable footage of your child
F43 1240 taking its first steps, you have merely recorded an historical event.
F43 1250 If, in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends,
F43 1260 you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's
F43 1270 grandmother watching this event, you have begun to be an artist in
F43 1280 film; you are employing the basic technique of film; you are cutting.
F43 1290    This is what Porter did. As the robbers leave the looted
F43 1300 train, the film suddenly cuts back to the station, where the telegrapher's
F43 1310 little daughter arrives with her father's dinner pail only
F43 1320 to find him bound on the floor. She dashes around in alarm. The two
F43 1330 events are taking place at the same time. Time and space have both become
F43 1340 cinematic. We leap from event to event- including the formation
F43 1350 of the posse- even though the events, in "reality" are taking
F43 1360 place not in sequence but simultaneously, and not near each other but
F43 1370 at a considerable distance.   The "chase" as a standard film
F43 1380 device probably dates from <The Great Train Robbery>, and there
F43 1390 is a reason for the continued popularity of the device. The chase in
F43 1400 itself is a narrative; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands
F43 1410 cutting- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage
F43 1420 of the journey of both. The simple, naked idea of one man chasing another
F43 1430 is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other
F43 1440 form of fiction. The cowboy films, the cops and robbers films, and
F43 1450 the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not
F43 1460 only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence;
F43 1470 these films and these sequences are also seeking out- instinctively
F43 1480 or by design- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative.
F43 1490 #THE CREATOR OF THE ART OF THE FILM: D&W&GRIFFITH# There
F43 1500 still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full
F43 1510 potential of the new form and to make it an art. The man was D&W&
F43 1520 Griffith. When he came to the movies- more or less by accident-
F43 1530 they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking
F43 1540 for an idle few minutes. In about seven years Griffith either
F43 1550 invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource
F43 1560 at the disposal of the film maker. Before he was forty Griffith
F43 1570 had created the art of the film.   Not that there had not been
F43 1580 attempts, mostly European, to do exactly that. But in general the European
F43 1590 efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly
F43 1600 emerging language of the film itself. Staggeringly condensed versions
F43 1610 of famous novels and famous plays were presented. Great actors
F43 1620 and actresses- the most notable being Sarah Bernhardt- were hired
F43 1630 to repeat their stage performances before the camera. In all of this
F43 1640 extensive and expensive effort, the camera was downgraded to the status
F43 1650 of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor
F43 1660 or by the author. The phonograph today, for all its high fidelity
F43 1670 and stereophonic sound, is precisely what the early art purveyors in
F43 1680 the movies wished to make of the camera. Not surprisingly, this approach
F43 1690 did not work. The effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques
F43 1700 in the early years of the century and some interesting records
F43 1710 of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names. But no art
F43 1720 at all was born of the art effort in the early movies.
F44 0010 In general, religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis;
F44 0020 congregational membership, however, is another thing. A congregation
F44 0030 survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership;
F44 0040 that is, when it can preserve economic integration. Religious
F44 0050 faith can be considered a <necessary> condition of membership in
F44 0060 a congregation, since the decision to join a worshiping group requires
F44 0070 some motive force, but faith is not a <sufficient> condition for joining;
F44 0080 the presence of other members of similar social and economic
F44 0090 level is the <sufficient> condition.   The breakdown of social
F44 0100 homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account
F44 0110 for the decline of central city churches. Central cities reveal
F44 0120 two adverse features for the major denominations: (1) central cities
F44 0130 tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes; (2) central
F44 0140 cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition. The central
F44 0150 city areas, in other words, exhibit the two characteristics which
F44 0160 violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations:
F44 0170 they have too few middle-class people; they mix middle-class people
F44 0180 with lower-class residents. Central city areas have become progressively
F44 0190 poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus
F44 0200 of middle-class people from most central cities. With few exceptions,
F44 0210 the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central
F44 0220 city.   The key to Protestant development, therefore, is economic
F44 0230 integration of the nucleus of the congregation. Members of higher
F44 0240 and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus, so that Protestant
F44 0250 figures on social class give the impression of spread over all
F44 0260 social classes; but this is deceptive, for the core of membership
F44 0265 is
F44 0270 concentrated in a single social and economic stratum. The congregation
F44 0280 perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the
F44 0290 neighborhood; moreover, residential mobility is so high in metropolitan
F44 0300 areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum
F44 0310 in order to survive; they can lose higher- and lower-status members
F44 0320 from the church without collapsing, but they need adequate recruits
F44 0330 for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration. The
F44 0340 congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group; it is
F44 0350 secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship. If it were primarily
F44 0360 a believing fellowship, it would recruit believers from all social
F44 0370 and economic ranks, something which most congregations of the New Protestantism
F44 0380 (with a few notable exceptions) have not been able to do.
F44 0390 They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers.
F44 0400    The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences
F44 0410 has often been attributed to the "folksy spirit" of Protestant
F44 0420 religious life; in fact, a contrast is often drawn in this regard
F44 0430 with the "impersonal" Roman Catholic parish. We have seen that
F44 0440 the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers; consequently, the
F44 0450 vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress
F44 0460 on personal community in Protestant congregations; actually, there
F44 0470 is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations,
F44 0480 as we shall see in another connection. The vulnerability of
F44 0490 Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of
F44 0500 the new religious style in middle-class life, where the congregation is
F44 0510 a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform, therefore,
F44 0520 to the principle of economic integration. This fact is evident
F44 0530 in the recruitment of new members. #MISSION AS CO-OPTATION# The
F44 0540 rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the
F44 0550 missionary outreach of the major denominations. There is much talk
F44 0560 in theological circles about the "Church as Mission" and the "Church's
F44 0570 Mission"; theologians have been stressing the fact that
F44 0580 the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in
F44 0590 the world for the healing of the world. A crucial question, therefore,
F44 0600 is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism.
F44 0610 If economic integration really shapes congregational life, then
F44 0620 evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration.
F44 0630 The task of a congregation would be defined, according to economic integration,
F44 0640 as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar
F44 0650 social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation.
F44 0660 (Co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to
F44 0670 fill a vacancy; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power
F44 0680 from an environment in order to strengthen an organization.) In a
F44 0690 mobile society, congregational health depends on a constant process of
F44 0700 recruitment; this recruitment, however, must follow the pattern of
F44 0710 economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation; therefore,
F44 0720 the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation
F44 0730 rather than proclamation- like elements will have to be assimilated.
F44 0740    Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been
F44 0750 carefully studied in the churches; one study in Pittsburgh, however,
F44 0760 has illuminated the situation. In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh
F44 0770 churches, almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial "contacts
F44 0780 with friendly members". If we add to these contacts with friendly
F44 0790 members the "contacts with an organization of the church" (11.2
F44 0800 per cent of the cases), then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment
F44 0810 is through friendly contact. On the surface, this seems a sound
F44 0820 approach to Christian mission: members of the congregation show by
F44 0830 their friendly attitudes that they care for new people; the new people
F44 0840 respond in kind by joining the church.   Missionary outreach
F44 0850 by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what
F44 0860 is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods; the majority
F44 0870 of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic
F44 0880 position; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle
F44 0890 of informal relations. This means that the antennae of the congregation
F44 0900 are extended into the community, picking up the wave lengths
F44 0910 of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation;
F44 0920 the mission of the church is actually a process of informal
F44 0930 co-optation; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people
F44 0940 who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation.
F44 0950 Churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long
F44 0960 as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people
F44 0970 who can fit the pattern of economic integration; once the pool of recruits
F44 0980 diminishes, the congregation is helpless- friendly contacts no
F44 0990 longer keep it going.   The transmutation of mission to co-optation
F44 1000 is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities,
F44 1010 worship, preaching, and publicity in reaching new members. The
F44 1020 proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts
F44 1030 by the clergy (17.3 per cent of new members) and friendly contacts
F44 1040 by members (over two thirds if organizational activities are included).
F44 1050 Publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial contacts with
F44 1060 new members. In general, friendly contact with a member followed by
F44 1070 contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment
F44 1080 by the churches, making it quite evident that the extension of economic
F44 1090 integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission
F44 1100 in the contemporary church; economic integration and co-optation are
F44 1110 the two methods by which Protestants associate with and recruit from
F44 1120 the neighborhood. The inner life of congregations will prosper so long
F44 1130 as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize
F44 1140 together; the outer life of congregations- the suitability
F44 1150 of the environment to their survival- will be propitious so long as
F44 1160 the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the
F44 1170 membership. Economic integration ceases when the social and economic
F44 1180 statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of
F44 1190 the congregation. In a rapidly changing society congregations will run
F44 1200 into difficulties repeatedly, since such nice balances of economic integration
F44 1210 are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single
F44 1220 generation. The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations
F44 1230 have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred
F44 1240 years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle
F44 1250 to maintain economic balance. The expense of this type of organization
F44 1260 in religious life, when one recalls the number of city churches which
F44 1270 deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned, raises fundamental
F44 1280 questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile
F44 1290 society; nonetheless, the prevalence of economic integration in congregations
F44 1300 illumines the nature of the Protestant development.
F44 1310 It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had
F44 1320 split into two trends- expanding interdependence on an impersonal
F44 1330 basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings. These trends
F44 1340 seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis. Residential
F44 1350 associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions.
F44 1360 The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential
F44 1370 communities have polarized; the schism between central city and suburb,
F44 1380 Negro and White, blue collar and white collar can be viewed as
F44 1390 symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis.
F44 1400 It now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved
F44 1410 with the economy of middle-class culture, for it serves to crystallize
F44 1420 the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings.
F44 1430 The accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the
F44 1440 drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations. This
F44 1450 conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable
F44 1460 environment. More than creatures of metropolitan forces, the
F44 1470 churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan
F44 1480 life, crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of
F44 1490 peoples, giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world
F44 1500 of heterogeneous peoples.   Since American life is committed
F44 1510 above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life, the
F44 1520 countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have
F44 1530 fought a desperate, rearguard action against the expanding interdependence
F44 1540 of the metropolis. Consumer communities have suffered at the hands
F44 1550 of the productive interests. Negroes, Puerto Ricans, and rural
F44 1560 newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities. Soon they will
F44 1570 fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs, and the churches
F44 1580 will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized
F44 1590 their history for a century. The identification of the basic unit
F44 1600 of religious organization- the parish or congregation- with a
F44 1610 residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis, for it simply
F44 1620 means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the Christian
F44 1630 fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation. Mission
F44 1640 to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential
F44 1650 community, because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan
F44 1660 interdependence with residential exclusion.   This interpretation
F44 1670 of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could
F44 1680 lead to various projections for the churches. It could be argued
F44 1690 that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed
F44 1700 to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the
F44 1710 middle classes. It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain
F44 1720 religious activity, since worship presupposes some local stabilities.
F44 1730 Whatever projection one makes, the striking fact about congregational
F44 1740 and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the
F44 1750 social identity of middle-class people.   Attention will be given
F44 1760 in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational
F44 1770 churches; this style is characteristically an expression of the
F44 1780 communal style of the middle classes. The keynotes of this style are
F44 1790 activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem. These
F44 1800 values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman, dictating
F44 1810 the methods of child rearing, determining the pattern of community
F44 1820 participation, setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of
F44 1830 middle-class illness, and informing the congregational life of the major
F44 1840 denominations. "Fellowship by likeness" and "mission by friendly
F44 1850 contact" form the iron cage of denominational religion. Its contents
F44 1860 are another matter, for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued
F44 1870 by the congregation. What goes on in the cage will occupy our attention
F44 1880 under the rubric of the organization church. An understanding
F44 1890 of the new role of residential association in an industrial society
F44 1900 serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of
F44 1910 conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity.
F44 1920    The perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes
F44 1930 turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs
F44 1940 and charities should fill the same need.
F45 0010 With capital largely squandered, there seemed to them no other course
F45 0020 to pursue.   The directors sold directly to concessionaires, who
F45 0030 had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company.
F45 0040 These concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt
F45 0050 with the Indians through <engages>, who might be <habitants, voyageurs>,
F45 0060 or even soldiers. The concessionaires also had to pay a tax of
F45 0070 one-tenth on the goods they traded, and all pelts were to be taken to
F45 0080 company stores and shipped to France in company ships. The company
F45 0090 disposed of the pelts, but with what profit, the records do not show.
F45 0100    In accord with its penurious policy, the company failed to furnish
F45 0110 presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians. The lavish
F45 0120 use of presents had been effective in expanding the Indian trade
F45 0130 of New France and Louisiana in the previous century, and the change
F45 0140 in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men. Traders
F45 0150 from the English colonies were far more generous, and Indian loyalty
F45 0160 turned to them. Protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded,
F45 0170 and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose Indian
F45 0180 insurrections that brought ruin to the company.   In 1721
F45 0190 the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana with full powers to do
F45 0200 all that was necessary to protect the colony. They ordered the raising
F45 0210 of troops and obtained 75,000 livres with which to build forts. They
F45 0220 adopted a program by which Louisiana was divided into five districts.
F45 0230 In each of these there was to be a strong military post, and a trading
F45 0240 depot to supply the smaller trading houses. For southeastern
F45 0245 Louisiana,
F45 0250 Mobile was the principal post, and it was to furnish supplies
F45 0260 for trade to the north and east, in the region threatened by British
F45 0270 traders. Mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending
F45 0280 northward to the sources of the Tennessee River. Fort Toulouse,
F45 0290 on the Alabama River, had been erected in 1714 for trade with the Alabamas
F45 0300 and Choctaws, but money was available for only one other new
F45 0310 post, near the present Nashville, Tennessee, and this was soon abandoned.
F45 0320    West of the Mobile district was the lower Mississippi
F45 0330 district, of which New Orleans was headquarters. Dependent upon it
F45 0340 were posts on the lower Mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers
F45 0350 of New Spain.   On the middle Mississippi a principal
F45 0360 post was to be located near the mouth of the Arkansas. It was hoped
F45 0370 that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west,
F45 0380 principally down the Arkansas River. On the Ohio or Wabash was to
F45 0390 be built another post "at the fork of two great rivers". Other
F45 0400 posts would be established up the Ohio and Wabash to protect communication
F45 0410 with Canada. On the upper Mississippi the Illinois post was
F45 0420 to be established near Kaskaskia, and dependent posts were to be built
F45 0430 on the Missouri, "where there are mines in abundance".
F45 0440 Each of the five principal posts was to have a director, responsible
F45 0450 to a director-general at New Orleans. An elaborate system of accounting
F45 0460 and reports was worked out, and the trade was to be managed in the
F45 0470 most scientific way. Concessionaires were to be under the supervision
F45 0480 of the directors. <Engages> must be loyal to the concessionaires,
F45 0490 and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended.
F45 0500 The <habitants> were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose
F45 0510 of their pelts to the concessionaires.   Only two principal storehouses
F45 0520 were actually established- one at Mobile, the other at New
F45 0530 Orleans. New Orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the Mississippi,
F45 0540 and west of that river, and on the Ohio and Wabash. Mobile
F45 0550 was also supplied by New Orleans with goods for the Mobile district.
F45 0560    The power that Bienville exercised during his first administration
F45 0570 cannot be determined. Regulations for the Indian trade were
F45 0580 made by the <Conseil superieure de la Louisiane>, and Bienville
F45 0590 apparently did not have control of that body. The <Conseil> even
F45 0600 treated the serious matter of British aggression as its business and,
F45 0610 on its own authority, sent to disaffected savages merchandise "suitable
F45 0620 for the peltry trade". It decided, also, that the purely secular
F45 0630 efforts of Bienville were insufficient, and sent missionaries to
F45 0640 win the savages from the heathen Carolinians.   During the first
F45 0650 administration of Bienville, the peltry trade of the Mobile district
F45 0660 was a lucrative source of revenue. The Alabamas brought in annually
F45 0670 15,000 to 20,000 deerskins, and the Choctaws and Chickasaws brought
F45 0680 the total up to 50,000 pelts. These deerskins were the raw material
F45 0690 for the manufacture of leather, and were the only articles which the
F45 0700 tribes of this district had to exchange for European goods.
F45 0710 During his first administration, Bienville succeeded in keeping Carolina
F45 0720 traders out of the Alabama country and the Choctaw country. The
F45 0730 director of the post at Mobile kept an adequate amount of French
F45 0740 goods, of a kind to which they were accustomed, to supply the Indian
F45 0750 needs. The Alabama and Tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which
F45 0760 goods could be moved quickly and cheaply. De la Laude, commander
F45 0770 of the Alabama post, had the friendship of the natives, and was able
F45 0780 to make them look upon the British as poor competitors. Diron d'Artaguette,
F45 0790 the most prominent trader in the district, was energetic and
F45 0800 resourceful, but his methods often aroused the ire of the French governors.
F45 0810 He became, after a time, commander of a post on the Alabama
F45 0820 River, but his operations extended from Mobile throughout the district,
F45 0830 and he finally obtained a monopoly of the Indian trade.   The
F45 0840 Chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the Mobile district.
F45 0850 Their territory lay to the north, near the sources of the Alabama,
F45 0860 the Tombigbee, the Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers, and was
F45 0870 easily accessible to traders among the near-by Cherokees. In 1720 some
F45 0880 Chickasaws massacred the French traders among them, and did not
F45 0890 make peace for four years. Venturesome traders, however, continued to
F45 0900 come to them from Mobile, and to obtain a considerable number of pelts
F45 0910 for the French markets. British traders from South Carolina incited
F45 0920 the Indians against the French, and there developed French and
F45 0930 British Factions in the tribe. The Chickasaws finally were the occasion
F45 0940 for the most disastrous wars during the French control of Louisiana.
F45 0950 To hold them was an essential part of French policy, for they
F45 0960 controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to Mobile.
F45 0970 They threatened constantly to give the British a hold on this region,
F45 0980 from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the French
F45 0990 settlements near the Gulf.   Bienville realized that if the French
F45 1000 were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of British
F45 1010 goods, French traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant
F45 1020 as the Carolinians and at reasonable prices. His urgings brought
F45 1030 some results. The Company of the Indies promised to send over a supply
F45 1040 of Indian trading goods, and to price them more cheaply in terms
F45 1050 of deerskins. But it coupled with this a requirement that Indians
F45 1060 must bring their pelts to Mobile and thus save all costs of transportation
F45 1070 into and out of the Indian country.   The insistence of Bienville
F45 1080 upon giving liberal prices to the Indians, in order to drive
F45 1090 back the Carolina traders, was probably a factor that led to his recall
F45 1100 in 1724. For two years his friend and cousin, Boisbriant, remained
F45 1110 as acting governor and could do little to stem the Anglican advance.
F45 1120 Although he incited a few friendly Indians to pillage the invaders,
F45 1130 and even kill some of them, the Carolina advance continued.
F45 1140    The company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from Carolina,
F45 1150 and when Perier came over as governor in 1727, he was given special
F45 1160 instructions regarding the trade of the Mobile district. But the
F45 1170 Company of the Indies, holding to its program of economy, made no arrangements
F45 1180 to furnish better goods at attractive prices. To the directors
F45 1190 the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy. Perier
F45 1200 attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among
F45 1210 the Indians. These agents were to ascertain the difference between
F45 1220 English and French goods, and the prices charged the Indians. They
F45 1230 were to conciliate the unfriendly savages, and, wherever possible, to
F45 1240 incite the natives to pillage the traders from Carolina. They were
F45 1250 to promise fine presents to the loyal red men, as well as an abundant
F45 1260 supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering.
F45 1270 Perier's intrigues gained some successes. The savages divided
F45 1280 into two factions; one was British and the other, French. So hostile
F45 1290 did these factions become that, among the Choctaws, civil war broke
F45 1300 out.   Perier's efforts, however, were on the whole ineffective
F45 1310 in winning back the tribes of the Mobile district, and he decided
F45 1320 to send troops into the troubled country. He asked the government
F45 1330 for two hundred soldiers, who were to be specifically assigned to arrest
F45 1340 English traders and disloyal Indians. In spite of the company's
F45 1350 restrictions, he planned to build new posts in the territory. He asked
F45 1360 also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the Indians'
F45 1370 pelts.   No help came from the crown, and Perier, in desperation,
F45 1390 gave a monopoly of the Indian trade in the district to D'Artaguette.
F45 1400 D'Artaguette went vigorously to work, and gave credit to many
F45 1410 hunters. But they brought back few pelts to pay their debts, and soon
F45 1420 French trade in the region was at an end. Perier finally, in one
F45 1430 last bid in 1730, cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent
F45 1440 above the cost in France. The Indians were not impressed and held
F45 1450 to the Carolina traders, who swarmed over the country, almost to the
F45 1460 Mississippi.   With the loss of the Mobile trade, which ended
F45 1470 all profits from Louisiana, the Natchez Indians revolted. They destroyed
F45 1480 a trading house and pillaged the goods, and harassed French shipping
F45 1490 on the Mississippi. The war to subdue them taxed the resources
F45 1500 of the colony and piled up enormous debts. In January, 1731, the company
F45 1510 asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony.
F45 1520 It stated that it had lost 20,000,000 livres in its operations, and apparently
F45 1530 blamed its poor success largely on the Indian trade. It offered
F45 1540 to surrender its right to exclusive trade, but asked an indemnity.
F45 1550 The King accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the
F45 1560 company at 1,450,000 livres. Thenceforth, the commerce of Louisiana
F45 1570 was free to all Frenchmen.   Company rule in Louisiana left the
F45 1580 colony without fortifications, arms, munitions, or supplies. The difficulties
F45 1590 of trade had ruined many <voyageurs>, and numbers of them
F45 1600 had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families. Others
F45 1610 left the country, and there was no one familiar with the Indian trade.
F45 1620 If this trade should be resumed, the <habitants> who had come
F45 1630 to be farmers or artisans, and soldiers discharged from the army, must
F45 1640 be hardened to the severe life of <coureurs de bois>. This was a
F45 1650 slow and difficult course, and French trade suffered from the many mistakes
F45 1660 of the new group of traders. These men were without capital or
F45 1670 experience.   Perier and Salmon, the intendant, wished either
F45 1680 to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown
F45 1690 furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts
F45 1700 with pelts. Bienville, who returned to succeed Perier in 1732, objected
F45 1710 that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing
F45 1720 a trade in which they could see no hope of profits. He reported, too,
F45 1730 that among the <habitants> there were none of probity and ability
F45 1740 sufficient to justify entrusting them with the King's goods. He did
F45 1750 find some to trust, however, and he employed the King's soldiers
F45 1760 to trade. With no company to interfere, he kept close control over all
F45 1770 the traders.   In order to compete with English traders, Bienville
F45 1780 radically changed the price schedule. The King should expect
F45 1790 no profit, and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in France,
F45 1800 which would cover the expense of transportation and handling, was all
F45 1810 he charged the traders.
F46 0010 They would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned
F46 0020 a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong at the Treasury's expense.
F46 0030 They would be particularly displeased with the State Department if
F46 0040 it were the source of such reports. Few things are more perilous for
F46 0050 the State Department than a displeased congressman.   The reason
F46 0060 for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why State spends
F46 0070 so much of its diplomatic energy on Congress when the Russians are
F46 0080 so available. First, the State Department is unique among government
F46 0090 agencies for its lack of public supporters. The farmers may be aroused
F46 0100 if Congress cuts into the Agriculture Department's budget. Businessmen
F46 0110 will rise if Congress attacks the Commerce Department.
F46 0120 Labor restrains undue brutality toward the Labor Department; the
F46 0130 Chamber of Commerce, assaults upon the Treasury. A kaleidoscope of
F46 0140 pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly
F46 0150 toward the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The congressman's
F46 0160 patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the Defense
F46 0170 Department. Tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every
F46 0180 voter who can write.   With all these agencies, the congressman
F46 0190 must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly.
F46 0200 No such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon
F46 0210 the State Department in anger.   In many sections he may even
F46 0220 reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson. After
F46 0230 all, the money dispensed by State goes not to the farmer, the laborer,
F46 0240 or the businessman, but to <foreigners>. Not only do these foreigners
F46 0250 not vote for American congressmen; they are also probably
F46 0260 ungrateful for Uncle's Sam's bounty. And are not the State Department
F46 0270 men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders
F46 0280 who have never met a payroll? Will not the righteous congressman
F46 0290 be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with America
F46 0300 and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes?
F46 0310 The chances are excellent that he will.   The result is
F46 0320 that the State Department's perpetual position before Congress is
F46 0330 the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever
F46 0340 the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife. People in this
F46 0350 position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the
F46 0360 newspapers. State keeps the junketeering list a secret.   The
F46 0370 Department expects and receives no thanks from Congress for its discretion.
F46 0380 Congress is a harsh master. State is expected to arrange the
F46 0390 touring Cicero's foreign itinerary; its embassies are expected
F46 0400 to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way; embassy workers
F46 0410 are expected to entertain him according to his whim, frequently with
F46 0420 their savings for the children's college tuition.   But come
F46 0430 the next session of Congress, State can expect only that its summer
F46 0440 guest will bite its hand when it goes to the Capitol asking money
F46 0450 for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for
F46 0460 its diplomats. The congressman who, in Paris, may have stuffed his
F46 0470 wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of Notre-Dame will
F46 0480 systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance
F46 0490 for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the Treasury.
F46 0500    In the matter of money State's most unrelenting watchdog during
F46 0510 the Eisenhower years was Representative John J& Rooney, of
F46 0520 Brooklyn, who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses.
F46 0530 Diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful
F46 0540 coexistence, not with Nikita Khrushchev, but with John Rooney. Nothing
F46 0550 worked. In the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of
F46 0560 techniques they had tried to bring Rooney around- friendly persuasion,
F46 0570 groveling abasement, pressure subtly exerted through other powerful
F46 0580 congressmen, tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic
F46 0590 corps. Rooney remained untouched.   "The trouble" explained
F46 0600 Loy Henderson, then Deputy Undersecretary for Administration,
F46 0610 "is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing,
F46 0620 it always turns out that Rooney knows more about our budget than we
F46 0630 do".   One year the Department collected a file of case histories
F46 0640 to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's
F46 0650 entertainment bills out of personal income. News of the
F46 0660 project reached the press. Next day, reports went through the Department
F46 0670 that Rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt
F46 0680 to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances
F46 0690 and had sworn an oath that, that year, expense allowances would not
F46 0700 rise a dollar. They didn't.   The Department's constant
F46 0710 fight with the House for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic
F46 0720 bloody engagements with the Senate. Armed with constitutional
F46 0730 power to negate the Executive's foreign policy, the Senate carries
F46 0740 a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the State Department's
F46 0750 back, or on the head of the Secretary of State.   With
F46 0760 its power to investigate, the Senate can paralyze the Secretary by
F46 0770 keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees, as it
F46 0780 did with Dean Acheson. John Foster Dulles escaped by keeping his
F46 0790 personal show on the road and because Lyndon Johnson, who was then
F46 0800 operating the Senate, refused to let it become an Inquisition. During
F46 0810 Dulles's first two years in office, while Republicans ran the
F46 0820 Senate, the Department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for
F46 0825 its
F46 0830 blood since 1945.   An internal police operation managed by Scott
F46 0840 McLeod, a former F&B&I& man installed as security officer
F46 0850 upon congressional insistence, was part of the vengeance. So was
F46 0860 the attack upon Charles E& Bohlen when Eisenhower appointed him
F46 0870 Ambassador to Moscow. The principal mauler, however, was Senator
F46 0880 Joseph McCarthy. Where Acheson had fought a gallant losing battle
F46 0890 for the Department, Dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates.
F46 0900 Fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats,
F46 0910 Dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men
F46 0920 had their way.   In view of Eisenhower's reluctance to concede
F46 0930 that anything was amiss in the Terror, it is doubtful that heroic intervention
F46 0940 by Dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him
F46 0950 and the country's foreign policy. In any event, the example of Acheson's
F46 0960 trampling by the Senate did not encourage Dulles to provoke
F46 0970 it. He elected to "get along".   During this dark chapter
F46 0980 in State Department history, men who had offered foreign-policy ideas
F46 0990 later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to Capitol
F46 1000 Hill. Their old errors of judgment were equated, in the curious
F46 1010 logic of the time, with present treasonous intent. Their successors,
F46 1020 absorbing the lesson, made it a point to have few ideas.   This,
F46 1030 in turn, brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the Democrats
F46 1040 took control. In the new style, the Department was berated as intellectually
F46 1050 barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit
F46 1060 the Russians. For three or four years in the mid-1950's, this
F46 1070 complaint was heard rumbling up from the Senate floor whenever there
F46 1080 was a dull legislative afternoon. It became smart to say that the fault
F46 1090 was with Dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by
F46 1100 anyone but himself.   An equally tenable thesis is that the dearth
F46 1110 of new thought was created by the Senate's own penchant for crucifying
F46 1120 anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation. #@
F46 1130 GETTING ALONG WITH FOREIGNERS# THERE ARE ninety-eight foreign
F46 1140 embassies and legations in Washington. They range from the Soviet
F46 1150 Embassy on Sixteenth Street, a gray shuttered pile suggesting a
F46 1155 funeral-accessories
F46 1160 display house, to what Congressman Rooney has called
F46 1170 "that monstrosity on Thirty-fourth Street", the modern cement-and-glass
F46 1180 chancery of the Belgians.   Here is the world of the
F46 1190 chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter, of caviar on stale crackers
F46 1200 and the warm martini, of the poseur, the spy, the party crasher,
F46 1210 and the patriot, of the rented tails, the double cross, and the tired
F46 1220 Lothario.   Into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries
F46 1230 around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions
F46 1240 on how to handle Uncle Sam in an infinite variety of contingencies.
F46 1250 Here are hatched plans for getting a share of the American bounty,
F46 1260 the secret of the anti-missile missile, or an invitation to dinner.
F46 1270 Out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting
F46 1280 to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside Washington.
F46 1290 Some, like the British and the French, maintain an elaborate
F46 1300 system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special
F46 1310 areas of the American scene. Other embassies cable home <The
F46 1320 New York Times> without changing a comma.   Each has its peculiar
F46 1330 style. The Soviet Embassy is popularly regarded as Russian espionage
F46 1340 headquarters. When Ambassador Mikhail Menshikov took it over
F46 1350 in 1957 from Georgi Zaroubin, he made a determined effort to change
F46 1360 this idea. Menshikov hit Washington with a ~TV announcer's
F46 1370 grin and a hearty handclasp. To everyone's astonishment he seemed
F46 1380 no more like the run-of-the-mine Russian ambassador than George Babbitt
F46 1390 was like Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov.   Where his predecessors
F46 1400 had glowered, Menshikov smiled. Where they had affected the
F46 1410 bleak social style of embalmers' assistants, Menshikov went abroad
F46 1420 gorgeous in white tie and tails. Overnight he became the most available
F46 1430 man in Washington. Speeches by the Soviet ambassador became the
F46 1440 vogue as he obliged rural Maryland Rotarians and National Press Club
F46 1450 alike. In Senator Joseph McCarthy's phrase, it was the most
F46 1460 unheard-of thing ever heard of. A newspaperman who met him at a reception
F46 1470 swore that he asked Menshikov: "What should we call you"?
F46 1480 And that Menshikov replied: "Just call me Mike".
F46 1490 "Smilin' Mike" was the sobriquet Washington gave him. His English
F46 1500 was usable and he used it fearlessly. Toasting in champagne one
F46 1510 night at the embassy, he hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and
F46 1520 gaily cried: "Up your bottom"! For a few giddy months that
F46 1530 coincided with one of Moscow's smiling moods, he was the sensation
F46 1540 of Washington. At the State Department, hard-bitten Russian experts
F46 1550 complained that the Capitol was out of its wits. Newspaper punditry
F46 1560 was inspired to remind everyone that Judas, too, had been able to
F46 1570 smile.   The Menshikov interlude ended as larks with the Russians
F46 1580 usually end. Finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable
F46 1590 because of domestic politics, Moscow resumed scowling and "Smilin'
F46 1600 Mike" dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional
F46 1610 story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the Middle West.
F46 1620    The most inscrutable embassies are the Arabs', and the most
F46 1630 inscrutable of the Arabs are the Saudi Arabians. When King Saud
F46 1640 visited Washington, the overwhelming question consuming the press
F46 1650 was the size of his family. Rumor had it that his children numbered
F46 1660 in the hundreds. The State Department was little help on this, or
F46 1670 on much else about Saudi Arabia. A reporter who consulted a Middle
F46 1680 East Information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until
F46 1690 the State Department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a
F46 1700 brochure published by the Arabian-American Oil Company. "This
F46 1710 is where I get my information from", he confided. "But bring it
F46 1720 right back. It's the only copy I've got".   The size of
F46 1730 Saud's family was still being debated when the King appeared for his
F46 1740 first meeting with Eisenhower. When it ended, a dusky sheik in desert
F46 1750 robes flowed into Hagerty's office to report on the interview.
F46 1760 The massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about Saudi-American
F46 1770 friendship to bore in on the central question. How many
F46 1780 children did the King have?   "Twenty-one", replied the sheik.
F46 1790    And how many of these were sons?   "Twenty-five",
F46 1800 the sheik replied.   "Do you mean to tell us", a reporter
F46 1810 asked, "that the King has twenty-one children, twenty-five of whom
F46 1820 are sons"?   The sheik smiled and murmured: "That is
F46 1830 precisely correct".   The Egyptians are noted for elusiveness
F46 1840 of language. When Dag Hammarskjold was negotiating the Middle East
F46 1850 peace after Israel's 1956 invasion of Egypt, he soon found himself
F46 1860 speaking the mysterious phrases of Cairo, a language as anarchic
F46 1870 as Casey Stengel's. The reports of President Nasser's pledges
F46 1880 which Hammarskjold was relaying from Cairo to Washington became
F46 1890 increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats, including the Israeli
F46 1900 Foreign Minister, Mrs& Golda Meir. Finally he reported that
F46 1910 Nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for Israeli
F46 1920 concessions.
F47 0010 The deep water is used by many people, but it is always clean, for the
F47 0020 washing is done outside. I know now why our Japanese friends were
F47 0030 surprised when they walked into our bathroom.   Of course, most
F47 0040 toilets are Eastern style- at floor level- but even when they are
F47 0050 raised to chair height, they are actually outside toilets- inside.
F47 0060 A few newer homes have Western flush toilets, but even with running
F47 0070 water, they are usually Eastern style.   The next day I visited
F47 0080 International Christian College which has developed since the war
F47 0090 under the leadership of people who were interned and who know Japan
F47 0100 well. They are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching
F47 0110 and learning. The library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical
F47 0120 stockroom. Spiritual life is cultivated, but students do not need
F47 0130 to be Christian. They have an enviable record of being able to place
F47 0140 in employment 100% of their graduates.   In the afternoon Miss
F47 0150 Hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young Mrs&
F47 0160 Kodama to see the famous Spring dances of the Geisha dancers. Mrs&
F47 0170 Hosaka is one of the Japanese women one reads about- beautiful,
F47 0180 artistically talented, an artful manager of her big household-
F47 0190 (four boys and four girls), and yet looking like a pampered, gentle Japanese
F47 0200 woman. She was a real experience! The dances were as beautiful
F47 0210 as anything I have ever seen- they rival the New York Rockettes
F47 0220 for scenery and precision as well as imagination.   Because
F47 0230 Don was leaving the next day, I spent the evening with him at Asia
F47 0240 Center. The following morning Mr& Morikawa called for me, and
F47 0250 we went to visit schools- kindergarten, middle-school, elementary
F47 0260 school, and high school- Mr& Yoshimoto's school. There
F47 0270 is much more freedom in the schools here than I expected- some think
F47 0280 too much.   There is a great deal of thought being given to
F47 0290 the question of moral education in the schools. With the loss of the
F47 0300 Emperor diety in Japan, the people are left in confusion with no God
F47 0310 or moral teachings that have strength. The older parents continued
F47 0320 to teach their children traditional principles, but the younger people,
F47 0330 who have lost all faith and convictions, are now parents. There seems
F47 0340 to be no purpose in life that is sure- no certain guiding principles
F47 0350 to give stability. As a result, money is spent quickly and freely,
F47 0360 with no thought of its value. Gambling is everywhere, especially among
F47 0370 students. Parents indulge their children.   The government
F47 0380 has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education
F47 0390 for the schools- but the teachers often have no firm conviction
F47 0400 and are confused. I was told that it is quite likely that Japanese
F47 0410 soldiers would not fight again- for why should they? It will be
F47 0420 painful, but interesting, to see what kind of a god these people will
F47 0430 create or what strong convictions they will develop.   In the evening
F47 0440 the former Oregon State science teachers met for dinner at the
F47 0450 New Tokyo Restaurant where I had my first raw fish and found it good.
F47 0460 They suggested several new foods, and usually I found them good,
F47 0470 except the sweets, which I think I could learn to like. Six of the
F47 0480 science teachers were present, and we had great fun. #KYOTO# After
F47 0490 a day at Nikko, Mrs& Kodama put me on the train for Kyoto.
F47 0500 My instructions were that Mr& Nishimo would meet me at the hotel,
F47 0510 but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm
F47 0520 welcome. My hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by Masu and the Japan
F47 0530 Travel Bureau and were more elegant than I would have chosen,
F47 0540 but it was fun for once to be elegant- I did explain to the students,
F47 0550 however, that this was not my usual style, for their salaries are very
F47 0560 small, and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well. They
F47 0570 understood and teased me a bit about it.   I think I would have
F47 0580 been much disappointed in Japan if I had not seen Kyoto, Nara,
F47 0590 and Hiroshima. Kyoto is the ancient capital of Japan and still its
F47 0600 cultural center. It, along with Nara, was untouched by the war-
F47 0605 and
F47 0610 is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar Japan. Here
F47 0620 I was accompanied by Mrs& Okamoto (Fumio's mother), her son,
F47 0630 Mr& Washizu (a prospective student with whom I have been corresponding
F47 0640 for more than a year), and Mr& Nishima, one of the science
F47 0650 teachers. I arrived at 7:00 a&m& and by 9:00 a&m& I had
F47 0660 finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned.
F47 0670 We walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens. We visited the
F47 0680 Okamoto home- where for the first time I saw the famous tea ceremony.
F47 0690 At 6:00 p&m& we went to the Kyoto Spring dances at the place
F47 0700 where these beautiful dances originated. They were even better than
F47 0710 those of Tokyo- more spectacular and more imaginative.   After
F47 0720 a supper of <unagi> (rice with eel- eel which is raised in an
F47 0730 ice-cold pond at the foot of Mt& Fuji), I returned to my beautiful
F47 0740 room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day.
F47 0750 We started at 9 a&m& to visit the Kyoto University where Mr&
F47 0760 Washizu is attending. I was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities
F47 0770 accompanying the medical school. They apologized for the condition,
F47 0780 including dirt and flies, and I was a little at a loss to know what
F47 0790 to say. There seemed to be no excuse? I don't have the answer
F47 0800 yet.   We had tea at Mr& Washizu's home where I learned
F47 0810 that he, too, comes from a very wealthy family. His grandfather is
F47 0820 a Buddhist priest; and he, being the eldest, was supposed to be a priest,
F47 0830 but he chose to do differently, and one of his brothers is to become
F47 0840 the priest. This is a significant fact in Japan, for only a few
F47 0850 years ago he would have had no choice. In his big home live four families
F47 0860 and thirty people, so it needs to be big. Also, there are housed
F47 0870 here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old-
F47 0880 paintings, lacquer, brocade, etc&. He had displayed more of them
F47 0890 than usual so that I could enjoy them. About 100 of the most important
F47 0900 items he had already given to the museum. The house itself is 400
F47 0910 years old with all the craftsmanship of older, less-hurried times. #NARA,
F47 0920 OSAKA, AND HIROSHIMA# Mr& Nishima went with me on the train
F47 0930 to Nara. We passed his house and school on the way. In Nara I
F47 0940 stayed at the hotel where the Prince and Princess had stayed on their
F47 0950 honeymoon. A new red carpet had been laid for their coming, but I
F47 0960 walked on it, too. Here Mr& Yoneda met us after a three-hour train
F47 0970 trip from the town where he teaches. Even though we had walked miles
F47 0980 in Kyoto that day, we started out again to see Nara at night.
F47 0990    In the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles
F47 1000 to Osaka to put me on the train for Hiroshima. Again the plan was
F47 1010 for me to go alone, but they wouldn't let me. At Osaka, Mr& Yoneda
F47 1020 had to leave us to get the train to his home, but Mr& Nishima
F47 1030 and I had an hour and a half before train time to see Osaka at night.
F47 1040 It is the second largest city in Japan, with about four million people.
F47 1050 One spot in Osaka I shall always remember- the bridge where
F47 1060 we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the
F47 1070 still waters of the river. In the midst of a great busy city, people
F47 1080 take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light.
F47 1090    My train arrived in Hiroshima at the awful hour of 4:45
F47 1100 a&m&. I had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little,
F47 1110 after which Mr& Uno would arrive and pilot me around. But there
F47 1120 he was at the train with an Oregon State pennant in his hand.
F47 1130    I know now why the students insisted that I go to Hiroshima even
F47 1140 when I told them I didn't want to. They knew that I was still grieving
F47 1150 over the tragic event, and they felt that if I could see the
F47 1160 recovery
F47 1170 and the spirit of the people, who hold no grudge, but who also
F47 1180 regret Pearl Harbor, I would be happier and would understand better
F47 1190 a new Japan. There were no words to say this but there was no need.
F47 1200    The teachers of Mr& Uno's school gave me a small gift
F47 1210 to thank me for coming. Hiroshima is a better city than it was before-
F47 1220 in the minds of the people I met was a strong determination for peace
F47 1230 and understanding. I was grateful for their insight into my need
F47 1240 for this experience. A better world may yet come out of Hiroshima.
F47 1250 #TOKYO# On arriving in Tokyo later we were met by Masu who took
F47 1260 us immediately to her university, the Japanese Women's University.
F47 1270 This day was "Open House for Parents" day, and the girls were
F47 1280 busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables. Everything was in
F47 1290 an exciting turmoil- full of anticipation and fun.   It was
F47 1300 thrilling to see the effect of an American-trained teacher on Japanese
F47 1310 students in a class in Home Planning. Our Masu is one of the very
F47 1320 few architects in Japan who is trying to plan homes around family
F47 1330 functions and women's needs. I am told the time will soon come when
F47 1340 women will find it necessary to do most of their own work, and even now
F47 1350 it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants. Many
F47 1360 of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in American
F47 1370 homes, but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using Japanese
F47 1390 artfulness in our own Western architecture at the same time that the
F47 1400 Japanese are adopting Western utility patterns.   At this Women's
F47 1410 University we find a monument to a courageous family who believed
F47 1420 that Japanese women also should be educated. Even today there are
F47 1430 some doubts about the value of education for Japanese women, but this
F47 1440 University continues to grow and to send its students out into the
F47 1450 community. Active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus
F47 1460 where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they
F47 1470 can have their social gatherings and professional meetings. As far
F47 1480 as I am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the
F47 1490 creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found
F47 1500 by educated women unafraid to break traditions.   Masu is also
F47 1510 teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for Japanese widows in Tokyo.
F47 1520 Here the women learn to keep house as maids; they become skilled
F47 1530 in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests. They learn how
F47 1540 to take care of children and sick members of the family. They have model
F47 1550 kitchens, a sick room with a model patient in bed, and a nursery with
F47 1560 a life-like doll. Although the training is only for one month, it
F47 1570 is intensive and thorough. Graduates of this maid's school are much
F47 1580 in demand and can always find work immediately. Occasionally they return
F47 1590 for additional training. Masu's home economics training comes
F47 1600 into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for
F47 1610 the storage of cleaning materials. Masu also uses the training she got
F47 1620 in an American home where she learned to polish furniture, clean corners,
F47 1630 and work effectively in keeping a shiny house. Her education in
F47 1640 the United States, not just in a classroom, but also in an American
F47 1650 house with an American housekeeper, stands her in good stead. #UNIVERSITY
F47 1660 OF TOKYO# After a fine luncheon in the cafeteria, the kitchen
F47 1670 of which Masu had planned, Mr& Washizu and I left to meet representatives
F47 1680 of the ~USIS for a visit to the University of Tokyo.
F47 1690 Here again it was vacation time and there were many things I could
F47 1700 not see, but I was able to visit with a professor who is famous
F47 1710 in Japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant.
F48 0010 The achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only
F48 0020 by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following
F48 0030 consultation between Attorney General Rogers and the heads
F48 0040 of certain national chain stores should, of course, be applauded. But
F48 0050 for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of
F48 0060 a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts
F48 0070 contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case. The suppositions
F48 0080 in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing
F48 0090 a connection between general company practice and local practice
F48 0100 in the South, and by establishing such direct connection between the
F48 0110 practice and the economic well-being of stores located in New York
F48 0120 and general company policy. Then the boycott would not be secondary,
F48 0130 but a primary one. It would be directed against the actual location of
F48 0140 the unjust policy which, for love's sake and for the sake of justice,
F48 0150 must be removed, and, indivisible from this, to the economic injury
F48 0160 of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy. Perhaps
F48 0170 this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire
F48 0180 national chain in order, by threatening potential injury to its entire
F48 0190 economy, to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores
F48 0200 in the matter of segregation. Such a general boycott might still be a
F48 0210 blunt or indiscriminating instrument, and therefore of questionable
F48 0215 justification.
F48 0220 Action located where the evil is concentrated will prove
F48 0230 most decisive and is most clearly legitimate. Moreover, prudence alone
F48 0240 would indicate that, unless the local customs are already ready to
F48 0250 fall when pushed, the results of direct economic action everywhere upon
F48 0260 national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage
F48 0270 to local and state stores which conform to these customs, leading to
F48 0280 greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company, or even
F48 0290 (as the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure
F48 0300 to correct injustice) to its going out of business in certain sections
F48 0310 of the country (as, for that matter, the Quakers, who once had many
F48 0320 meetings in the pre-Civil War South, largely went out of business
F48 0330 in that part of the country over the slavery issue, never to recover
F48 0340 a large number of southern adherents).   In any case, anyone who
F48 0350 fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary
F48 0360 applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified
F48 0370 that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years
F48 0380 ago or was skillfully organized by White Citizens' Councils
F48 0390 in the entire state of Mississippi against every local Philco dealer
F48 0400 in that state, in protest against a Philco-sponsored program over a
F48 0410 national ~TV network on which was presented a drama showing, it seemed,
F48 0420 a "high yellow gal" smooching with a white man. It is true,
F48 0430 of course, that the end or objective of this action was different. But
F48 0440 since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals
F48 0450 and concerning justice and injustice, and since, in a situation where
F48 0460 direct action and economic pressure are called for, the justice of the
F48 0470 matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not
F48 0480 effectively present, there has to be a <morality of means> applied in
F48 0490 every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures
F48 0500 or other forms of force.   the need that we not give unqualified
F48 0510 approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed
F48 0520 against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the
F48 0530 fact that White Citizens' Councils seem resolved to maintain segregation
F48 0540 mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical
F48 0550 violence. An unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically
F48 0560 opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow
F48 0570 humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously
F48 0580 brutal means. The end or aim of the action, of course, is also
F48 0590 important, especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community
F48 0600 customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person
F48 0610 from stepping forward to claim his legal rights, e&g&, against
F48 0620 Negroes who register to vote in Fayette County, Tennessee, at the
F48 0630 present moment. Here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance
F48 0640 to those being despoiled, and to legal remedies. This, however,
F48 0650 is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and
F48 0660 economic conflict (if both sides are strong enough) can be war of all
F48 0670 against all no less than if other means are used. It is also sufficient
F48 0680 to show the Christian and any other champion of justice that he needs
F48 0690 to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his <conduct>
F48 0700 is just, i&e&, that, if economic pressure has to be resorted
F48 0710 to, this be applied directly against those persons directly in the
F48 0720 way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices, while,
F48 0730 if injury fall upon others, it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily
F48 0740 (however inevitably) and not by deliberate intent and direct
F48 0750 action against them.   It is clear that non-violent resistance is
F48 0760 a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in Christian
F48 0770 morality, like any other form of resistance. The <language> used
F48 0780 itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle
F48 0790 for victory (perhaps to be chosen above all others). One of the sit-in
F48 0800 leaders has said: "Nobody from the top of Heaven to the bottom
F48 0810 of Hell can stop the march to freedom. Everybody in the world today
F48 0820 might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom
F48 0830 is going to march over them". The present writer certainly agrees
F48 0840 with that statement, and would also affirm this- in the order of justice.
F48 0850 However, it is also a Christian insight to know that unless charity
F48 0860 interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches
F48 0870 forward. And when charity interpenetrates man's struggle for justice
F48 0880 and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental
F48 0890 good will. It also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained
F48 0900 above, and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent
F48 0910 means.
F48 0920 R& B& Gregg has written that "non-violence and good will of
F48 0930 the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical
F48 0940 jiu-jitsu, to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance. He
F48 0950 suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent
F48 0960 resistance of most victims would render him"; and again, that
F48 0970 "the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object
F48 0980 of war- namely, to demoralize the opponent, to break his will,
F48 0990 to destroy his confidence, enthusiasm, and hope. In another respect
F48 1000 it is dissimilar, for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent
F48 1010 only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is
F48 1020 based on sounder values".   A trial of strength, however, is made
F48 1030 quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent
F48 1040 resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder
F48 1050 values than those of his opponent; and in warfare with any means,
F48 1060 men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause. This makes necessary
F48 1070 a morality of means, and principles governing the <conduct> of
F48 1080 resistance whenever this is thought to be justified. The question,
F48 1090 then, is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent
F48 1100 means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes
F48 1110 and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing
F48 1120 him. Here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some
F48 1130 causes as more important than their lives; and to them it will seem
F48 1140 insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently.
F48 1150 A technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into
F48 1160 the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem
F48 1170 the more unlimited aggression.   Among Christian groups, the
F48 1180 Mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that
F48 1190 the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the
F48 1200 Christian use of all forms of pressure. Since the will and word of God
F48 1210 are for them concentrated in Christlike love, it seems clear to them
F48 1220 that non-violent resistance is quite another thing. "The primary
F48 1230 objective of non-violence", writes the outstanding Mennonite ethicist,
F48 1240 "is not peace, or obedience to the divine will, but rather certain
F48 1250 desired social changes, for personal, or class, or national advantage".
F48 1260 Without agreeing with every phrase in this statement, we must
F48 1270 certainly assert the great difference between Christian love and any
F48 1280 form of resistance, and then go on beyond the Mennonite position and
F48 1290 affirm that Christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine
F48 1300 the moral principles limiting resistance. These principles we
F48 1310 have now set forth. <Economy> in the use of power needs not only to
F48 1320 be asserted, but clearly specified; and when this is done it will
F48 1330 be found that the principles governing Christian resistance cut across
F48 1340 the distinction between violent and non-violent means, and apply to
F48 1350 both alike, justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action.
F48 1360 Economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a
F48 1370 <barely
F48 1380 intolerable> pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed.
F48 1390 That would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly
F48 1400 in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals. There
F48 1410 must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use
F48 1420 of means of resistance, violent or non-violent. The justification
F48 1430 in Christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays
F48 1440 down its limitation- in the distinction between the persons against
F48 1450 whom pressure is primarily directed, those upon whom it may be permitted
F48 1460 also to fall, and those who may never be directly repressed for the
F48 1470 sake even of achieving some great good. In these terms, the "economic
F48 1480 withdrawal" of the Negroes of Nashville, Tennessee, from trading
F48 1490 in the center city, for example, was clearly justified, since these
F48 1500 distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be
F48 1510 singled out.   We may now take up for consideration a hard case
F48 1520 which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure
F48 1530 or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above.
F48 1540 There may be instances in which, if economic pressure is to be undertaken
F48 1550 at all, this would have to be applied without discrimination
F48 1560 against a whole people. An excellent article was published recently in
F48 1570 the journal of the Church Peace Union by a South African journalist
F48 1580 on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in South Africa,
F48 1590 amounting to virtual slavery, and the economic <complicity> of both
F48 1600 the government and the people of the United States in these conditions.
F48 1610 "**h Billions of American dollars, not only from capital investors
F48 1620 but also from the pockets of U& S& taxpayers", this author
F48 1630 states, "are being poured into South Africa to support a system
F48 1640 dedicated to the oppression, the persecution, and the almost diabolical
F48 1650 exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens
F48 1660 not to be white". Both the conditions and the complicity are documented
F48 1670 in considerable detail. This leads to the conclusion that "the
F48 1680 fact is inescapable that America does have a say in whether or not
F48 1690 <apartheid> shall continue". Our leadership in a wide economic
F48 1700 boycott of South Africa would be not only in accord, it seems, with
F48 1710 the moral conscience of America, not to be denied because we also as
F48 1720 a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our
F48 1730 own country, but also in accord with our law, U&S& Code Title
F48 1740 19, Section 1307, which forbids the importation of goods made by forced
F48 1750 or convict labor. Not only should this provision be enforced but
F48 1760 other economic and political actions might be taken which, this author
F48 1780 believes, "must surely be supported by every American who values the
F48 1790 freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated
F48 1800 by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly
F48 1810 contribute to the enslavement of another nation".
